(LOOKING GLASS' "BRANDY
(YOU'RE A FINE GIRL)" PLAYING)
There's a girl in this harbor town.
And she works layin' whiskey down.
They say, "Brandy, fetch another round".
And she serves them whiskey and wine.
The sailors say
"Brandy, you're a fine girl".
"What a good wife you would be"

EGO: Come on!
MEREDITH: (YELPS) Slow down!

Where are you taking me?
Come on, come on.
Look. Look!
(GASPS) Oh, it's beautiful!
EGO: I was afraid
it wouldn't take to the soil...
but it rooted quickly.
And soon, it'll be everywhere.
All across the universe.
(MEREDITH GIGGLES)
Well, I don't know what
you're talking about...
but I like the way you say it.
(SIGHS) My heart is yours...
Meredith Quill.
I can't believe I fell in love
with a spaceman.

- Showtime, a-holes!

It will be here any minute.
Which will be its loss.
I thought your thing was a sword?
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?
It hurts.
It hurts?
I have sensitive nipples.
(ROCKET LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"
What about him? What's he doing?
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.
How is that a priority?
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.
That's hardly important right now.
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.
No, seriously, I side with Drax.
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.
I can clearly see you winking.
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

I must cut through it from the inside.
Huh?
- (LAUGHING)
- No, no! Drax, wait a minute!
Drax!
(DRAX YELLING)
What is he doing?
He said the skin is too thick
to be pierced from the outside, so he...
- That doesn't make any sense!
- I tried telling him that!
Skin is the same level of thickness
from the inside as from the outside!
I realize that.

There is a cut on its neck.

(CONTINUES LAUGHING)
What?
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)
What are they called again?
Anulax batteries.
Harbulary batteries.
That's nothing like what I just said.
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.
The cost of transgression is death.
AYESHA: We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.
Impeccable,
both physically and mentally.
We control the DNA of our progeny...
germinating them in birthing pods.
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.
Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.
For academic purposes.
I would be honored, yes.
In the name of research...
I think that could be pretty, uh...
repulsive.
I'm not into that kind of casual...
Oh, please.
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.
Bring it...
and we shall gladly be on our way.
(GRUNTS)
Family reunion. Yay.
I understand she is your sister.
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.
Do with her as you please.
(NEBULA GRUNTS)
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?
My mother is from Earth.
And your father?
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.
I see it within you.
An unorthodox genealogy.
A hybrid that seems particularly...
reckless.
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...
- but that isn't true at all.
- (CROWD GASPS)
ROCKET: Oh, shit.
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?
I'm sorry. That was meant to be
behind your back.
Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.
You're telling me.
- You wanna buy some batteries?
- (LAUGHING)
(SHUSHING)
(ALIOTTA HAYNES JEREMIAH'S

ROCKET: All right,
let's get baldy to Xandar
and collect that bounty.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
(MUSIC CONTINUES IN BACKGROUND)
(SIGHS)
That stuff about my father...
Who does she think she is?
I know you're sensitive about that.
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.
I wasn't.
I don't care if you were.
Well, I feel like you do care.
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
Damn shadow.
There are two types of beings
in the universe...
those who dance, and those who do not.
Mmm-hmm.
I first met my beloved at a war rally.
Oh, God.
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.
Except one woman.
My Ovette.
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.
She wouldn't even tap her foot.
Wouldn't move a muscle.
One might assume she was dead.
That does sound pretty hot.
It would make
my nether regions engorge.
Okay. I get it, yes.
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.
Mmm.
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.
No. It's not ripe yet...
and I hate you.
You hate me?
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.
And yet here you stand, a hero.
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.
I swear.
No.
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days
in a prison on Xandar...
wishing you could.
- (GRUNTS)
- (ALARM BLARING)
QUILL: This is weird.
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.
GAMORA: Why would they do that?
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.
Dude!
Right.
He didn't steal some of those.
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.
- (QUILL GRUNTS)
- (GAMORA YELPS)
(WHIMPERS)
(GRUNTS)
What were you thinking?
Dude, they were really easy to steal!
- That's your defense?
- Come on!
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!
I was being sarcastic!
Oh, no!
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!
Now I look foolish!
Can we put the bickering on hold...
until after we survive
this massive space battle?
QUILL: More incoming!
ROCKET: Good!
I wanna kill some guys!
(ROCKET YELLING)
(CONTINUES YELLING)
GAMORA: You're not killing anyone.
All those ships are remotely piloted.
(GRUNTS)
Damn it!
(EXCITED CHATTER)
What is the delay, Admiral?
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...
and could destroy the entire fleet.
Our concern is their slight
against our people.
We hired them and they steal from us.
It is heresy of the highest order.
All command modules...
fire with the intent to kill.
(GRUNTS)
What's the nearest habitable planet?
It's called Berhert.
- How many jumps?
- Only one.
But the access point is 47 clicks away.
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.
Quill, to make it through that...
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.
Lucky for us, I...
I am.
ROCKET: What are you doing?
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!
Stop it.
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...
and there's gonna be something squishy
in your pillow case.
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.
Oh, it won't be my turd.
It will be Drax's.
(DRAX LAUGHING)
I have famously huge turds.
We're about to die,
and this is what we're discussing?

Hold on.

(SOVEREIGN PILOTS SCREAMING)
Someone destroyed all our ships!
What?
Who?
GAMORA: One click!
- What is that?
- Who cares?
That's the jump point! Go!
It's a guy.
(DRAX SCREAMING)
Oh, my God.
He's still out there?

That was awesome!
Yes!
GAMORA: Look at this!
Where is the other half of our ship?
QUILL: My ship.
GAMORA: Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field...
had you flown with
what's between your ears
instead of what's between your legs!
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.
More like because he stole...
the Anulax batteries!
They're called Harbulary batteries.
No, they're not!
Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."
I did it because I wanted to!
Dick.
What are we even talking about this for?
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!
How little?
Well, I don't know, like this?
A little one-inch man saved us?
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.
Don't call me a raccoon!
I'm sorry. I took it too far.
I meant trash panda.
Is that better?
I don't know.
It's worse. It's so much worse.
You son of a...
Hey!
ROCKET: I've had it with you!
QUILL: No! Back up!
NEBULA: Someone followed you
through the jump point.
Set me free, you'll need my help.
I'm not a fool, Nebula.
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
No, I won't.
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.
I bet it's the one-inch man.
After all these years, I've found you.
And who the hell are you?
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.
My name is Ego...
and I'm your dad, Peter.

STAKAR: After going around
years in circles...
with this woman I end up marrying.
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...
"but you're losing your mind!"
Then again, she's always been that way.
I could never trust her. You know?
Stakar.
It's been some time.
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.
- Sir!
- Stakar!
STAKAR: There's a hundred
Ravager factions.
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.
Please, sir. Please!
Get away from me.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
(GROWLS)
You can go to hell then!
I don't give a damn what you think of me!
So what are you following us for?
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!
Ravagers don't deal in kids.
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!
You didn't know because
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.
I demand a seat at the table!
I wear these flames, same as you.
You may dress like us...
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.
And the Colors of Ogord...
will never flash over your grave.
If you think...
I take pleasure in exiling you...
you're wrong.
You broke all our hearts.
Ah, pathetic.
First, Quill betrays us...
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.
We followed him
because he was the one...
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.
Seems he's goin' soft.
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?
You know I'm right, Kraglin.
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.
RAVAGER: Who the hell is that?
(GRUNTING)
(SIGHS)
Yondu Udonta...
I have a proposition for you.
EGO: I hired Yondu to pick you up...
when your mother passed away.
But instead of returning you...
Yondu kept you.
I have no clue as to why.
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because I was a skinny little kid
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.
It made it easier for thievin'.
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.
DRAX: I thought Yondu was your father.
What? We've been together
this whole time...
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?
You look exactly alike.
One's blue!
No, he's not my father!
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.
- Eat you?
- Yeah.
Oh, that son of a bitch.
How'd you locate us now?
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.
What say we head out there right now?
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.
I promise you...
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.
And there...
I can explain your very special heritage.
Finally get to be...
the father I've always wanted to be.
Excuse me.
I've gotta take a whiz.
I'm not buying it.
Let's go take a walk.
- (WHISTLING)
- (URINATING)
I am Mantis.
What are you doing?
Smiling.
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.
Not if you do it like that.
Oh...
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.
Yes.
- (GRUNTS)
- (SCREAMS)
(LAUGHING)
That is called a practical joke!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
I liked it very much!
I just made it up!
(BOTH CONTINUE LAUGHING)
QUILL: Give me a break!
After all this time,
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...
- you wanna be my dad?
- GAMORA: I hear you.
QUILL: And by the way,
this could be a trap.
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...
But what?
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?
Who?
He owned a magic boat?
David Hasselhoff?
Right.
Not a magic boat. A talking car.
Why did he talk again?
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...
and you would tell
all the other children...
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?
I love that story.
- I hate that story.
- (SIGHS)
It's so sad!
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!
That's my point, Peter.
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?
If he ends up being evil...
we will just kill him.
You're leaving me with that fox?
GAMORA: He's not a fox.
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.
(GRUMBLES)
- Or if you feel like it.
- ROCKET: Okay.
It'll be just a couple of days.
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
DRAX: What if the Sovereign come?
QUILL: There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.
I'm uncertain about parting ways.
God, you're like an old woman.
Because I'm wise?
GAMORA: Why do you have
so much luggage?
DRAX: I don't want Groot
playing with my things.
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?
Because it's working.
(FLEETWOOD MAC'S

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again.
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain.
And if you don't love me now.
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying.
You would never break the chain.
And if you don't love me now.
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying.
You would never break the chain
(DRAX AND QUILL LAUGHING)
QUILL: Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?
Oh...
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.
Your antennae, what are they for?
Their purpose?
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!
I say...
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.
QUILL: Right.
And if it's anything other than...
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.
They are not for feeling doorways.
- (SIGHS)
- (QUILL LAUGHS)
I think...
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.
What are those?
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.
- You read minds?
- No.
Telepaths know thoughts.
Empaths feel feelings.
Emotions.
May I?
All right.
You feel love.
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.
No!
Romantic, sexual love.
No, I don't.
- For her!
- No!
(LAUGHING)
QUILL: Okay.
(QUILL GROANS)
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!
You must be so embarrassed!
(DRAX CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Do me! Do me!
I have never felt such humor!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
So unbelievably uncool.
- Oh, Quill.
- (CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.
I can also alter emotions to some extent.
QUILL: Yeah, like what?
If I touch someone who is sad...
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.
I can make a stubborn person compliant.
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.
Do one of those on me.
Sleep.

Hey there, rat!
How's it going, you blue idiot?
Not so bad.
We got ourselves a pretty good

This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...
has offered us a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...
because she wants
- to kill y'all.
- (ALL LAUGHING)
Your friend...
There's too many of them.
He needs my help.
If you care about him...
you need to get me out of these bonds.
They are going to kill him!
YONDU: I tell you,
it was pretty easy to find you.
I put a tracer on your ship back there...
during the war over Xandar.
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
(CHUCKLES) Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
Otherwise, you'd what?
We'll take them batteries.
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?
That Priestess offered us a million.
A quarter is only one third of that!
A quarter ain't a third.
A quarter is 25.
No.
GEF: We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.
YONDU: Enough!
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...
you protect him like
none of the rest of us much matter!

No larger than your Earth's Moon.
Humility.
I like it.
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

You own a planet and can destroy

I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.
A Celestial, like a god?
Mmm, small "g," son.
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.
(EGO CHUCKLING)
QUILL: Whoa!
I don't know where I came from exactly.
First thing I remember is flickering...
adrift in the cosmos utterly...
and entirely alone.
Over millions of years...
I learned to control
the molecules around me.
I grew smarter and stronger.
And I continued building from there...
layer by layer...
the very planet you walk on now.
Whoa.
But I wanted more.
I desired...
meaning.
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...
"besides just me," I thought.
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.
I created...
what I imagined biological life
to be like...
down to the most minute detail.
Did you make a penis?
Dude!
What is wrong with you?
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?
He would smush her!
(QUILL GROANS)
I don't need to hear how my parents...
Why?
My father would tell the story
of impregnating my mother

That's disgusting.
It was beautiful.
You Earthers have hang-ups.
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.
Ha! Thank you!
It's not half bad.
- Oh.
- Ugh.
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...
and all the accompanying junk.
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...
as I set out amongst the stars...
until I found...
what I sought.
Life.
I was not alone in the universe after all.
When did you meet my mother?
Not long after.
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.
I called her my river lily.
And from that love, Peter...
you.
I have searched for you for so long.
And when I heard of a man from Earth...
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

RAVAGERS: Oh!
(RAVAGERS WHOOPING)
Captain!
Help me! Please!
Captain!
You're the one what killed those men...
by leading them down the wrong path.
Because you're weak.
- (GRUNTS)
- (ALL CHEERING)
And stupid!
It's time for the Ravagers...
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...
Taserface!
(ALL CHEERING)
(ROCKET LAUGHING)
I'm sorry. Your name is...
It's Taserface?
That's right.
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?
It's metaphorical!
ALL: Yeah!
For what?
For it is a name what strikes fear...
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.
(ALL MURMURING)
Okay.
ROCKET: Okay...
whatever you say.
You shut up.
You're next.
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...
- (ROCKET SNICKERING)
- What?
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?
"Taserface!" (LAUGHING)
- That's how I hear you in my head!
- (ALL SNICKERING)
What was your second choice?
- Scrotum Hat?
- (ALL LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING)
New plan. We're killing you first.
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.
That's enough killing for today.
(RAVAGERS MURMURING)
RAVAGER: She's the daughter
of Thanos.
TASERFACE: I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.
I assure you...
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...
or a talking woodland beast.
I want 10% of the take...
and a couple more things.
KRAGLIN: We got
a whole box of hands...
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.
What are you gonna do with your share?
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me
battle one another in training.
Every time my sister prevailed...
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.
But she won...
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.
So after I murder my sister...
I will buy a warship
with every conceivable
instrument of death.
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...
piece by piece...
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...
I know every single day.
Yeah.
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.
Or a nice hat.
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"
Anyways, happy trails.
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.
Peter...
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.
But you left...
the most wonderful woman ever...
to die alone.
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...
and the light within it...
this form will wither and perish.
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?
I loved your mother, Peter!
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!
I know exactly what that feels like!
I had to watch her die!
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...
I've made many mistakes, Peter.
But you're not one of them.
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...
and the light within.
They are a part of you, Peter.
What do you mean?
Give me your hands, son.
Here.
Hold them like that.
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.
(QUILL EXHALES DEEPLY)
(GASPS)
Yes!
Whoa!
Yes! It's okay.
Just relax. Concentrate.
You can do it. Bring it back.
Yes!
Yes, now shape it.
Feel that energy.
Yes.
You're home.
Peter...
DRAX: How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?
MANTIS: Ego found me
in my larva state.
Orphaned on my homeworld.
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.
So you're a pet?
I suppose.
People usually want cute pets.
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?
I am hideous?
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.
But that's a good thing.
Oh?
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...
you know they love you for who you are.
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.
DRAX: Those pools,
they remind me of a time...
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.
She was like you.
Disgusting?
Innocent.
(SOBS)
(SIGHS)
Drax?
There's something I must tell you.
What's going on?
This gross bug lady is my new friend.
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.
You're not ugly. Drax!
What are you talking about?
GAMORA: Mantis...
can you show us where we'll be staying?
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?
MANTIS: The planet is Ego.
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.
And you're not a flea?
I'm a flea with a purpose.
I help him sleep.
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?
Nothing.
Your quarters are this way.
(BOTH GRUNT)
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.
Okay, Taserface.
Hey, tell the other guys we said...
"Hi," Taserface!
(SIGHS)
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?
No, Gef.
It's too adorable to kill.
Take it to the tailor.
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.
But I was young...
and greedy, and stupid.
Like you stealing those batteries.
That was mostly Drax.
Me and Stakar and the other captains...
we weren't so different from
you and your friends.
The only family I ever had.
When I broke the code...
they exiled me.
This is what I deserve.
Slow down, drama queen.
You might deserve this, but I don't.
We gotta get outta here.
Where's Quill?
He went off with his old man.
- Ego?
- Yeah.
It's a day for dumbass names.
(CHUCKLES)
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.
You like a professional asshole or what?
Pretty much a pro.
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?
He was skinny.
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.
Uh-huh.
I got an idea on how to get outta here.
But we're gonna need your little friend.
ALL: (CHANTING)
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

YONDU: Psst!
Hey, twig!
Come here.
Come on.
Aw, man...
what did they do to you?
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...
the thing I wore on my head.
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.
You got it?
(RAVAGERS SNORING)
That's my underwears.
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.
You have to explain it more careful.
It's a prototype fin.
(SCREECHING)
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.
You explain it this time.
All right.
YONDU: That's Vorker's eye.
He takes it out when he sleeps.
Go. Look again.
But leave the eye here.
Why?
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...
and he's not gonna know...
where his eye is! (LAUGHING)
That's a desk.
We told you it was this big.
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...
with a bunch of severed human toes.
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.
Okay?
What? No!
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.
That's not what I said!
I am Groot.
He's relieved you don't want him to.
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.
I am Groot.
On anyone, not just himself.
I am Groot.
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.
That's why you don't like hats?
This is an important conversation
right now?
(SNORING)
(BURPS)
KRAGLIN: That ain't it.
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.
They killed all my friends.

Drax thinks you're not a dancer.
If you ever tell anyone about this...
I will kill you.
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?
What unspoken thing?
This...
Cheers, Sam and Diane...
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...
but never say it because if they do,
the ratings would go down...
sort of thing.
There's no unspoken thing.
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,
then it would be spoken...
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.
No, that's not what I...
(SIGHS)
What we should be discussing right now
is something about this place.
It doesn't feel right.
What are you talking about?
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!
That girl Mantis...
she's afraid of something.
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?
I'm not trying...
He's my father. He's blood.
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.
Again, you made me come here!
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?
That's the half I'm worried about.
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.
You were insufferable to begin with.
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...
to open themselves up
to new possibility,
and the other person is a jerk...
who doesn't trust anybody!
It's a show that doesn't exist.
That's why it would get zero ratings!
I don't know what Cheers is!

Yeah. (SIGHS)
It's fortuitous...
you listening to this song.
- You know...
- Brandy?
By Looking Glass?
(CHUCKLES) A favorite of your mom's.
Yeah, it was.
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.
Perhaps its very greatest.
Yes!
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.
He came on a summer's day.
Bringing gifts from far away.
Like the child I put in your mother...
or the freedom you brought Gamora.
Brandy, you're a fine girl.
What a good wife you would be.
My life, my love.
My lady is the sea.
The sea calls the sailor back.
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...
No, Peter...
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...
as long as the light
burns within the planet.
I'm immortal?
Mmm-hmm.
Really?
Yes! As long as the light exists.
And I can use the light
to build cool things...
like how you made this whole planet?
It might take you
a few million years of practice...
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!
What!
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...
and Heather Locklear.
You can do anything you want.
I'm gonna make some weird shit.
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.
Only we can remake the universe.
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...
and lead it to where it needs to go.
How?
Come with me.
(GASPS)
(SNORING)
Drax, Drax. Drax!

No, that's not what I...
(RETCHING)
What are you doing?
I'm imagining being with you physically.
Drax...
I don't like you like that.
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.
Hey! There's no need to get personal.
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.
I should have told you earlier.
I'm stupid. You are in danger.
(BOTH PANTING)
What is that?
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.
Everything around us,

Everything is temporary.
We are forever.
Doesn't eternity get boring?
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...
which is why you're here.
I told you how all those years ago...
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...
it was all so...
disappointing.
And that is when I came...
to a profound realization.
My innate desire to seek out other life...
was not so that I could
walk among that life.
Peter...
I have found meaning.
(GASPING)
I see it.
Eternity!
Oh, my God.
We need to get off this planet.

No. I don't care about those things.
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!
I can lord this over him forever.
(LAUGHING)
What are you laughing at me for?
You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.
I know who you are.
You don't know anything
about me, loser.
I know everything about you.
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.
Shut up!
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...
because just a little bit of love...
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.
I said shut up!
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.
I'm serious, dude!
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...
their own little baby, into slavery.
I know who you are, boy.
Because you're me.
What kind of a pair are we?
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.
All right, okay! Good. Wait.
Fight a what?
(GAMORA YELLS)
Who are you people?
What is this place?
Gamora, let her go!
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?
You are scared.
(MANTIS COUGHING)
I call it the Expansion.
It is my purpose...
and now it is yours as well.
It's beautiful.
Over thousands of years...
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...
on thousands of worlds.
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...
To grow and spread...
covering all that exists...
until everything is...
Me!
What did she do to me?
She already told me everything.
I only had one problem.
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power
for such an enterprise.
But two Celestials...
Well, now, that just might do.
The bodies...
are his children.
EGO: Out of all my labors...
the most beguiling was...
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...
to power the Expansion.
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.
It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.
But one after the other, they failed me.
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.
Until you, Peter.
Out of all my spawn...
only you carried
the connection to the light.
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.
- Then we just go.
- No!
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.
You're right.
We're family.
We leave no one behind.
Except maybe you.
Oh, my God.
For the first time in my existence...
I am truly not alone!
What is it, son?
My friends.
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.
Yes.
We are beyond such things.
Yes.
- Now...
- But my mother...
You said you loved my mother.
And that I did.
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.
And I knew if I returned a fourth...
I'd never leave.
The Expansion...
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.
So, I did what I had to do.
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.
What?
Now, all right...
I know that sounds bad.
(GROANING)
Who in the hell do you think you are?
You killed my mother!
I tried...
so hard...
to find the form...
that best suited you...
and this is the thanks I get?
You really need to grow up.
- (GASPS)
- I wanted to do this together...
but I suppose you'll have to learn
by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!

Captain?
(TRANSMISSION BREAKING UP)
Tell me why Ego wants you here?
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...
to help destroy the universe.
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.
So, could you?
A little.
I made a ball.
A ball?
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.
You "thought"?
You think when I make this arrow fly...
- I use my head?
- (GROANS)
(GRUNTING)
(ALL YELP)
Whoa.
There.
That's Ego's core.
GAMORA: That ore is thick, Rocket.
I got it covered.
We must hurry.
It will not take Ego long to find us.
Keep it steady.
We drill into the center, we kill him!
KRAGLIN: Captain?
What is it, Kraglin?
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?
- Yeah, why?

Why aren't you firing the lasers?
They blew out the generator.
I think I packed a small detonator.
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.
Well, we got these.
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...
throughout his entire nervous system.
Meaning what?
The entire planet will explode.
We'll have to get out of here fast.
I rigged a timer.
QUILL: Go!
(QUILL GRUNTING)
He's coming.
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?
When he wants. He's too powerful.
I can't!
You don't have to believe in yourself...
because I believe in you.
(GASPING)
(YELLS)
Sleep!
(GASPS)
I never thought she'd be able to do it...
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.
I don't know how long I can hold him.
ROCKET: The metal's too thick.
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.
QUILL: Well...
That's a terrible idea.
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.
(GROANS) Unbelievable.
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."
(SIGHS) What a day.
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.
That activates it.
Then you push this button...
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.
Now, whatever you do...
don't push this button...
because that will set off
the bomb immediately
and we'll all be dead.
Now, repeat back what I just said.
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.
- I am Groot.
- That's right.
- I am Groot.
- No!
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!
Try again.
Hmm...
- I am Groot.
- Mmm-hmm.
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.
I am Groot.
No! That's exactly what you just said!
How is that even possible?
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?
Point to it.
No!
QUILL: Hey, you're
making him nervous!
Shut up and get me some tape!
Does anybody have any tape out there?
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.
I don't have any tape. Let me check.
Yo, Yondu... Ow!
Do you have any tape?
(QUILL GROANING)
Gamora? Do you have any tape?
Tape!
Never mind. Ow!
Drax, do you have any tape?
- (ROCKET COUGHS)
- Yes, Scotch tape would work.
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,
if you don't have any?
Nobody has any tape!
Not a single person has tape?
Nope!
Did you ask Nebula?
Yes!
Are you sure?
I asked Yondu...
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!
You are wasting a lot of time here!
Whee!
We're all gonna die.
YONDU: Rear thrusters are out again!
- We're done for without that generator!

She's just unconscious.
How long until the bomb goes off?
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...
about six minutes.

T-minus five minutes.

You can't.

(SOBBING)
QUILL: I told Gamora...
how when I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.
Earlier, it struck me...
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.
He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...
but he did have the whistle of one.
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...
and hooked up with hot women...
and fought robots.
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.
Only it was you, Yondu.
I had a pretty cool dad.
What I'm trying to say here is...
sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...
it's right there by your side all along.
You don't even know it.
(SNIFFLES)
I am Groot.
He did call you twig.
Nebula...
I was a child like you.
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.
I'm trying to make it right.
There are little girls like you...
across the universe who are in danger.
You can stay with us and help them.
I will help them by killing Thanos.
I don't know if that's possible.
(NEBULA GASPS)
You will always be my sister.
KRAGLIN: Pete!
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.
What is it?
It's called a Zune.
It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.
It's got 300 songs on it.
300 songs?
Wait.
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.
I think Yondu would want you to have it.
Thanks...
Captain.

It's a Ravager funeral.

Yeah!
Yeah!
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.
No, he did not, son.
He did not.
Fare thee well, old friend.
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.
He didn't chase them away.
No.
Even though he yelled at them.
And was always mean.
And he stole batteries he didn't need.
Well, of course not.

("GUARDIANS INFERNO" PLAYING)
Ugh, dude.
Seriously?
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.
I am Groot.
I am not boring. You're boring.
You know what's boring?
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!
I'm not boring!
I am Groot.
And now I know how Yondu felt.
HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...
just remember...
We. Are. Groot.
Hey, fellas.
Wait, where are you going?
You were supposed to be my lift home.
How will I get out of here?
Hey! Aw, gee...
I've got so many more stories to tell.
Aw, guys.
Oh, gee...

Now, I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"
Well, sometimes you have to get captured
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.
See, I spent some time on Earth...
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.
Then I went searching through the Cosmos
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.
Didn't find any.
That's when I came across
a path of death and destruction,
which led me all the way here
into this cage,
where I met you.
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?
Thor, son of Odin.
Surtur, son of a bitch.
You're still alive.
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.
I cannot die.
Not until I fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home.
It's funny you should mention that.
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.
And you, Surtur,
are at the center of all of them.
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.
Hang on.
I'll be back around shortly.
I really feel like
we were connecting there.
Okay, so Ragnarok.
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.
My time has come.
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame,
I shall be restored to my full might.
I will tower over the mountains,
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...
Hang on. Give it a second.
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.
I'm really sorry.
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame
and then you'll suddenly grow as big
as a house?
A mountain!
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
locked away on Asgard?
Odin is not on Asgard.
And your absence has left the throne
defenseless.
Okay, so where is it? This crown?
This is my crown,
the source of my power.
Oh, that's a crown.
I thought it was a big eyebrow.
It's a crown.
Anyway, it sounds like
all I have to do to stop Ragnarok
is rip that thing off your head.
But Ragnarok has already begun.
You cannot stop it.
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.
All will suffer, all will burn.
That's intense.
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.
But it looks like I'm gonna have to
choose option B,
where I bust out of these chains,
knock that tiara off your head,
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.
You cannot stop Ragnarok.
Why fight it?
Because that's what heroes do.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.
And, now!
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.
I make grave mistakes all the time.
Everything seems to work out.
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,
but I could really use a fast exit.
Heimdall?
Heimdall was an idiot.
This job should have made him rich.
Now, the job ain't easy
but it does have its benefits.
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.
Behold...
My stuff.
I'm particularly fond of these.
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard
called Texas.
I even named them. Des and Troy.
You see, when you put them together,
they destroy.
Heimdall, come on.
Stay!
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.
Heimdall?
Skurge?
Is that important?
You girls are in for a treat.
Girls!
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.
Thanks for scaring away my company
and drenching my workplace in brains.
Who are you?
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
We fought together on Vanaheim.
Right. Where is Heimdall?
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.
Traitor?
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall
with negligence of duty
but he disappeared before the trial.
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.
Sure.
Hold on.
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.
What the hell is that?
Oh, brother. This is it.
I take my leave.
You fool, you didn't listen!
I'm sorry.
Lady Sif, get help!
Somebody, help!
Sorry for all I've done.
It's all right. Hold on.
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.
They'd be lucky to have you.
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.
I'm a trickster.
So mischievous.
Sorry about that time I turned you
into a frog.
It was a wonderful joke.
'Twas indeed hilarious.
You are the savior of Asgard.
- Tell my story.
- I will.
Build a statue for me.
We will build a big statue for you.
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.
I will tell Father
what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
And so, Loki died of his wounds,
giving his life for ours.
He fought back those disgusting elves,
he brought peace to the realm.
Loki, my boy...
'Twas many moons ago I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.
On that day,
I did not yet see in you
Asgard's savior. No.
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle
that melted this old fool's heart.
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.
Father.
Shit.
My son, Thor, has returned!
Greetings, my boy.
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.
The people wanted to commemorate him.
Indeed they should.
I like the statue.
A lot better looking than he was
when he was alive, though.
A little less weaselly, less greasy,
maybe.
Do you know what this is?
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster
and destroy the whole planet.
Thank you, dear.
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?
Nope.
I've been having this reoccurring dream
lately.
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.
That's just a silly dream,
signs of an overactive imagination.
Possibly.
But then I decide to go out there
and investigate.
And what do I find,
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,
all while you, Odin,
the protector of those Nine Realms,
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.
Yes, it is best
to respect our neighbors' freedom.
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.
Watching theater.
Board meetings,
and security council meetings...
- You're really gonna make me do it?
- Do what?
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir
as it returns to my hand.
Not even your face.
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.
Then I'll see you on the other side,
brother.
All right, I yield.
Behold!
Thor...
- Odinson.
- No.
You had one job. Just the one.
Where's Odin?
You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Everything was fine without you.
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.
- Ask them.
- Where's Father? Did you kill him?
You had what you wanted.
You had the independence you asked for.
Okay. I know exactly where he is.
I swear I left him right here.
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?
Great planning.
How was I supposed to know?
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.
No? Then why do you dress like one?
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.
I saw you die.
I mourned you, I cried for you.
I'm honored.
Ask him.
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture
with us?
Sure.
Start figuring out where he is.
Oh, my God.
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
She didn't dump me, you know.
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.
What's this? What are you doing?
This isn't me.
Loki.
Thor Odinson.
God of Thunder.
You can put down the umbrella.
So, Earth has wizards now?
The preferred term is
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.
All right, wizard. Who are you?
Why should I care?
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.
Take a seat.
Tea?
I don't drink tea.
What do you drink?
Not tea.
So, I keep a watch list of individuals
and beings from other realms
that may be a threat to this world.
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.
He's a worthy inclusion.
Then why bring him here?
We're looking for my father.
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was,
all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?
Promptly.
Great! Then I'll help you.
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.
And you don't have a phone.
No, I don't have a phone,
but you could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.
So if you could tell me where he is,
I can take him home.
Gladly. He's in Norway.
I'm just seeing whether this incantation
requires any Asgardian modifications.
Nope.
We don't need that.
Will you stop doing that?
I need just one strand of your hair.
Let me explain something.
My hair is not to be meddled with.
We could have just walked.
He's waiting for you.
All right.
Don't forget your umbrella.
Yes.
Sorry.
There we go.
I suppose I'll need my brother back.
Yeah. Right.
I have been falling for 30 minutes!
You can handle him from here.
Yes. Of course.
Thank you very much for your help.
Good luck.
Handle me? Who are you?
Loki.
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...
Bye-bye.
Father?
Look at this place. It's beautiful.
Father, it's us.
My sons.
I've been waiting for you.
I know. We've come to take you home.
Home, yes.
Your mother, she calls me.
Do you hear it?
Loki, lift your magic.
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.
Frigga would have been proud.
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.
I know we failed you.
But we can make this right.
I failed you.
It is upon us. Ragnarok.
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.
No.
It has already begun. She's coming.
My life was all that held her back.
But my time has come.
I cannot keep her away any longer.
Father, who are you talking about?
Goddess of Death. Hela.
My firstborn.
Your sister.
Your what?
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.
Locked her away.
She draws her strength from Asgard,
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.
No, we won't.
I'm on a different path now.
This you must face alone.
I love you, my sons.
Look at that.
Remember this place.
Home.
Brother.
This was your doing.
So he's gone.
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.
You must be Hela.
I'm Thor, son of Odin.
Really? You don't look like him.
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.
You sound like him.
Kneel.
Beg your pardon?
Kneel.
Before your queen.
I don't think so.
It's not possible.
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.
Bring us back!
No!
Loki!
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?
I'm Hela.
I'm just a janitor.
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.
How would you like a job?
Are you a fighter?
Or are you food?
I'm just passing through.
It is food.
On your knees.
He's mine.
Wait!
Wait!
He's mine.
So if you want him, you go through me.
But we've already got him.
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.
More food.
Thank you.
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.
I've got something special.
Hey! Where are you taking me?
Answer me!
Hey!
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.
Many apologies, your majesty.
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard,
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.
My father is dead.
As are the princes.
You're welcome.
We were once the seat
of absolute power in the Cosmos.
Our supremacy was unchallenged.
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.
Our destiny is to rule over all others.
And I am here to restore that power.
Kneel before me
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.
Whoever you are,
whatever you've done, surrender now!
Or we will show you no mercy.
Whoever I am?
Did you listen to a word I said?
This is your last warning!
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Fine.
Charge!
I've missed this.
Still, it's a shame.
Good soldiers dying for nothing,
all because
they couldn't see the future.
Sad.
Look, still alive.
Change of heart?
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.
You evil demoness!
Let's go see my palace.
Fear not, for you are found.
You are home,
and there is no going back.
No one leaves this place.
But what is this place?
The answer is Sakaar.
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.
It is the collection point
for all lost and unloved things.
Like you.
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.
You are valuable.
Here you are loved.
What the hell?
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.
He is the original,
the first lost and the first found.
The creator of Sakaar,
and father of the Contest of Champions.
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.
You are the property of the Grandmaster.
Congratulations!
You will meet the Grandmaster
in five seconds.
Prepare yourself.
Prepare yourself.
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.
He's wonderful.
It is a he?
It is a he.
Yeah.
I love when you come to visit, 142.
You bring me the best stuff.
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
about Scrapper 142,
what do I always say? "She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."
Trash.
No, not trash.
Were you waiting just to call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."
Booze hag.
I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."
'Cause I always say you're the best.
She brought me my beloved champion,
you know.
You say that every time she's here.
What have you brought today? Tell me.
A contender.
A what?
I need to go closer.
I want to get a closer look at this.
Can you take us closer? Thank you.
Pay this lady.
Just wait a damn minute.
I'm not for sale.
Man, he's a fighter.
I take 10 million.
Tell her she's dreaming.
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.
You'll pay for this.
No, I got paid for this.
Here's what I wanna know.
Who are you?
I am the God of Thunder.
I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your
fingers, was that sparkles?
We've located your cousin.
Good!
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.
There he is.
Hey, cuz.
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?
Hi.
So...
Please.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Carlo...
I pardon you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're officially pardoned.
From life.
Help me.
Oh, my God!
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!
The smell.
What does it smell like?
Burnt toast.
What happened to my manners?
I haven't properly introduced myself.
Come on. Follow me.
My name is Grandmaster.
I preside over a little harlequinade
called the Contest of Champions.
People come from far and wide
to unwillingly participate in it.
And you, my friend,
might just be part of the new cast.
What do you say to that?
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games.
I'm going back to Asgard.
Ass-gard.
One, two, three, four.
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.
At that moment, I let go.
Loki?
Loki! Loki!
Over here. Over here.
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!
- What?
- You're alive?
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.
- Get me out of this one. Get me out.
- I can't.
- I can't.
- What?
I've made friends with this man.
He's called the Grandmaster.
- He's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.
The Bifrost brought me out here
weeks ago.
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.
I just got here.
What are you whispering about?
Time works real different
around these parts.
On any other world, I'd be, like,
millions of years old.
But here on Sakaar...
In any case, you know this...
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
God of Thunder.
Tell him.
I've never met this man in my life.
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.
Is he any kind of a fighter?
You take this thing out of my neck
and I'll show you.
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.
If you wanna get back to Ass-place,
Assberg...
Asgard.
Any contender who defeats my champion,
their freedom they shall win.
Fine. Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick!
That's what I call, contender.
Direction would be this way, Lord.
Loki!
Hey. Take it easy, man.
Over here.
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.
I'm kind of like the leader in here.
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.
But don't let that intimidate you.
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke
for you.
This is my very good friend over here,
Miek.
He's an insect and has knives for hands.
You're a Kronan, aren't you?
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.
So hardly anyone turned up, except for
my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.
As punishment, I was forced
to be in here and become a gladiator.
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.
Do you reckon you'd be interested?
How did you...
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here, man.
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?
Doug has.
Doug!
Our luck, Doug's dead.
That's right.
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.
What about you? You're made of rocks.
Perishable rock.
There you go. Another one gone.
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.
Wait. You're not gonna face him,
are you?
Yes, I am.
Gonna fight him, win,
and get the hell out of this place.
That's exactly what Doug used to say.
See you later, new Doug.
Does no one remember me?
Has no one been taught our history?
Look at these lies.
Goblets and garden parties?
Peace treaties?
Odin...
Proud to have it,
ashamed of how he got it.
We were unstoppable.
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.
One by one, the realms became ours.
But then,
simply because my ambition outgrew his,
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.
Before that,
Asgard's warriors were honored,
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.
Most of the stuff in here is fake.
Or weak.
Smaller than I thought it would be.
That's not bad.
But this...
The Eternal Flame.
Want to see what true power
really looks like?
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
I've missed you.
I've missed you all.
Odin,
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,
where the brave shall live forever.
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,
for those that have died
the glorious death.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Being lied to.
Being told you're one thing
and then learning it's all a fiction.
You didn't think
I'd really come and see you, did you?
This place is disgusting.
Does this mean you don't want my help?
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position
with the Grandmaster.
It took me time to win his trust.
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.
What I'm telling you is, you could
join me at the Grandmaster's side.
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?
Our sister destroyed your hammer
like a piece of glass.
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.
You don't stand a chance.
Do you understand
what I'm saying here?
Fine.
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.
Like I've always done.
Would you say something?
Say something!
What would you like me to say?
You faked your own death,
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.
Have I said enough or would you like me
to go back further than the past two days?
You know, I haven't seen this
beloved champion he talks of,
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.
I've placed a large wager against you
tomorrow.
Don't let me down.
Piss off, ghost!
He's freaking gone.
Yuck!
There's still someone's hair and blood
all over this.
Guys, can you clean up the weapons
once you finish your fight?
Disgusting slobs.
Thor,
wanna use a big wooden fork?
No.
Yeah, not really useful.
Unless you're fighting off three vampires
that were huddled together.
I really wish I had my hammer.
Hammer?
Quite unique.
It was made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.
And when I spun it really, really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.
You rode a hammer?
No, I didn't ride the hammer.
The hammer rode you on your back?
No. I used to spin it really fast,
and it would pull me off the...
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?
The ground. It would pull me off the
ground, up into the air, and I would fly.
Every time I threw it,
it would always come back to me.
Sounds like you had a pretty special
and intimate relationship with this hammer
and that losing it was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.
That's a nice way of putting it.
I said they're mine.
See her,
that's the one that put me in here.
Yeah. Scrapper 142.
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.
They are hard to perish.
Asgardian?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.
Asgard is in danger.
My God, you're a Valkyrie.
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger,
until I found out that
you were all women.
There's nothing wrong with women,
of course. I love women.
Sometimes a little too much.
Not in a creepy way,
just more of a respectful appreciation.
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.
It's about time.
Are you done?
Lord of Thunder, you're up.
Please, help me. I need your help.
Bye.
Fine, then you must be a traitor
or a coward.
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect
the throne.
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.
Bring him in for processing.
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.
Now, don't you move.
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair,
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.
Please.
Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.
Please! No!
No!
Look at all of you.
What a show! What a night!
Who's having fun?
Please, I'm your host.
Big round of applause
for all of our undercard competitors,
who today died so gruesomely.
Good sports.
What a show! What a night!
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.
And now, without further ado,
it's main event time.
Making his first appearance,
though he looks quite promising,
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.
I'll say no more, see what you think.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Lord of Thunder.
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.
Okay, this is it.
Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.
He is a creature.
What can we say about him?
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.
I feel a special connection with him.
He's undefeated.
He's the reigning.
He's the defending.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you...
Your Incredible...
Hulk!
Yes!
I have to get off this planet.
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
Hey!
We know each other.
He's a friend from work.
Where have you been?
Everybody thought you were dead.
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer.
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?
He's up there.
Loki! Look who it is!
Banner,
I never thought I would say this,
but I'm happy to see you.
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!
Banner.
Hey, Banner!
No Banner. Only Hulk.
What are you doing?
It's me. It's Thor!
Banner, we're friends.
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!
Here we go.
What?
Hey, big guy.
The sun's getting real low.
That's it.
The sun's going down.
I won't hurt you anymore.
No one will.
Yes!
That's how it feels!
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.
All right. Screw it.
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out!
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!
I told them we were friends!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Another day, another Doug.
What is that noise?
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.
There's a resistance trying to knock down
the front gates.
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.
What I meant was,
what's your ambition?
I just want a chance to prove myself.
Recognition.
When I was young,
every great king had an executioner.
Not just to execute people,
but also to execute their vision.
But mainly to execute people.
Still, it was a great honor.
I was Odin's executioner.
And you shall be my executioner.
Let's begin our conquest.
Skurge, where's the sword?
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.
Those people you mentioned,
the ones who aren't falling into line...
Round them up.
Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
These bloody things are everywhere.
Come on.
You'll be safe here.
Are we cool?
It's Hulk in a hot tub.
So how long
have you been like that?
Like what?
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.
Hulk always Hulk.
How'd you get here?
Winning.
You mean cheating?
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?
How'd you arrive here?
Quinjet.
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?
That's naked.
He's very naked.
It's in my brain now.
Quinjet.
Yes!
I'm getting us out of here.
This terrible, awful place.
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.
Hulk stay.
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.
We must prevent Ragnarok.
Ragnarok?
The prophesied death of my home world.
The end of days, it's the end of...
If you help me get back to Asgard,
I can help you get back to Earth.
Earth hate Hulk.
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.
You're one of the Avengers.
One of the team, one of our friends.
This is what friends do.
They support each other.
You're Banner's friend.
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.
Banner's friend.
I don't even like Banner.
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."
Thor go. Hulk stay.
Fine.
Stay here.
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.
Smash you.
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Baby arms.
- What?
Baby.
Moron! You big child.
Thor go!
I am going.
Thor go again.
Thor home.
Hulk trains.
That's great. Have fun.
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.
What have you been up to?
Winning.
Heimdall, I know you can see me.
I need you to help me.
Help me see.
I see you, but you're far away.
What's going on here?
Come see for yourself.
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold
built by our ancestors.
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?
We won't last long if we stay.
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.
Come on.
Hela is ravenous.
If I let her leave, she'll consume
Nine Realms and all the Cosmos.
We need you.
I'm working on it. But I don't even know
where the hell I am.
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.
- Which one?
- The big one.
Thor sad.
Shut up.
Thor sad.
I'm not sad, you idiot.
I'm pissed off!
Angry. I lost my father.
I lost my hammer.
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
- You're not even listening.
Don't kick stuff.
You're being a really bad friend.
You bad friend!
- You know what we call you?
- No.
We call you the stupid Avenger.
You're tiny Avenger!
What, are you crazy?
Yes.
You know what? Earth does hate you.
No.
I'm sorry I said those things.
You're not the stupid Avenger.
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.
It's okay.
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.
Hulk always, always angry.
I know.
We're the same, you and I.
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.
Yeah, same.
Hulk like fire, Thor like water.
We're kind of both like fire.
But Hulk like real fire.
Hulk like raging fire.
Thor like smoldering fire.
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.
Angry girl.
What's going on? What are you...
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone?
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.
I need her to stay.
Stay?
Block.
Stay.
- Please.
- Please.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I'll listen to you
till this is empty.
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.
We need to get back there.
I need your help.
Finished. Bye.
Odin is dead.
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.
I'm going to stop her.
- Alone?
- Nope.
I'm putting together a team.
It's me, you, and the big guy.
No. No team. Only Hulk.
It's me and you.
I think it's only you.
Please, listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.
I'm not getting dragged into
another one of Odin's family squabbles.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace
and tried to seize the throne.
When she tried
to escape her banishment
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.
I only survived because...
Look, I already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne,
and it cost me everything.
That's what's wrong with Asgard.
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.
I agree.
Don't get familiar.
I agree.
That's why I turned down the throne.
But this isn't about the crown.
This is about the people.
They're dying
and they're your people, too.
Forget it.
I have.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Good. Great.
- Great.
Thank you.
- For what?
- For this.
Didn't see that, did you?
There... That's better.
You know, go ahead.
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.
Keep drinking, keep hiding.
But me...
I choose to run toward my problems
and not away from them.
Because that's what...
Because that's what heroes do.
Friend stay!
Yes!
All right.
Come on.
Welcome. Voice activation required.
Thor.
Access denied.
Thor, son of Odin.
Access denied.
God of Thunder.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Damn you, Stark.
Point Break.
Welcome, Point Break.
Friend stay!
No, no, no!
Stop!
Stay!
Hulk, stop breaking everything!
Don't go!
Nice work, big guy.
We don't know where Ultron's headed,
but you're going very high, very fast.
So, I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode,
so I need you to help me out. Okay?
I need you to...
No! No, Banner!
Oh, jeez.
Banner.
Hey, hey, hey.
You all right, Banner?
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.
That's it, breathe.
I won't hurt you.
Sun's going down.
- Thor.
- Yeah.
What happened to your hair?
Some creepy old man cut it off.
- It looks good.
- Thanks.
Where are we? How's Nat?
- Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?
- Banner, listen.
- What?
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.
What are you saying?
What?
I've been Hulk for two years?
I'm afraid so.
What the hell happened?
Banner, there's something
you should know.
Voice activation required.
Banner.
Welcome, strongest Avenger.
What?
Ship's log.
Thor, where are we?
Yeah, about that.
Sakaar, hear ye.
Attention please. I have some bad news.
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.
Who's that?
He kind of runs the place.
You actually lived at his house
for awhile.
- I did?
- Yeah.
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.
Doesn't sound right.
Well, it's true.
It seems that that criminally seductive
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.
Oh, no.
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.
No, no, no.
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.
These are Tony's clothes.
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?
No, he's not here.
But listen. Just stay calm, okay?
The sun's going down. The sun's getting
really low. Sun's going down.
I'm upset!
I'm very upset.
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.
And you know who I'm blaming?
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!
Don't interrupt me!
Here you go.
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?
He was interrupting.
That's not a capital violation.
Where was I?
My precious champion
has come up missing,
and it's all because of that
Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.
Your brother.
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated, or you know.
I'm sure there's a big history.
And your contender...
My dear friend,
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could
bring them both back to you. Alive.
I could do it in two.
I could do it in one.
Let's stop there.
You know what? I woke up this morning
thinking about a public execution.
But for now,
I'll settle for this sweet little
"Who's gonna get him first?"
So, you're on the clock.
What have you done?
I don't answer to you, lackey.
It's Loki.
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.
Why would you help my brother escape
with that green fool?
I don't help anyone.
You're a Valkyrie.
I thought the Valkyrie had all died
gruesome deaths.
Choose your next words wisely.
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low.
Oh, shoot.
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?
I just need you to stay calm.
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.
Yeah. One.
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.
It's a new experience.
My neurons, they're firing faster
than my brain can handle the information.
The whole thing
is totally different this time.
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.
No, it's not what matters.
What I'm trying to tell you, is that
if I turn into the Hulk again,
Banner may never come back.
And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.
Thank you.
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.
What?
Listen, my people are in great danger.
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,
who also happens to be my sister.
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...
I don't wanna fight your sister.
That's a family issue.
No, she's an evil being.
I don't care what she is.
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.
- What?
- I just told you.
If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.
And you don't care.
No, no. I'm putting together the team.
The Hulk is the fire.
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.
- What? No!
- It's gross.
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.
No! I don't even like the Hulk.
He's all like...
"Smash, smash, smash."
I prefer you.
Thanks.
But if I'm being honest,
when it comes to fighting evil beings,
he is very powerful and useful.
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
Is he though?
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.
What are you doing with that?
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?
Because you were naked.
Okay, I'll give you that.
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!
Tony wears his pants super tight.
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.
Maybe the fact that I was trapped
for two years
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.
Hey. It's okay.
You're good. Calm down. Come on.
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard
and you're not gonna have to think about
the Hulk ever again. All right?
All right.
This is bad.
Banner! Banner!
Banner!
Banner!
Thor!
Hi.
Hi.
I was gonna do that.
Yeah, well, I did it first.
That's good. What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.
I got sidetracked.
What's with the...
It's my disguise.
But I can see your face.
Not when I do this, you can't.
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did
with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?
What are those things on her eyes?
Are those people that she's killed?
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.
Who is this guy?
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too.
Look, I've spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.
Sakaar seemed like the best place
to drink and forget, and to die one day.
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.
I don't plan to stop drinking.
But I don't wanna forget.
I can't turn away anymore,
so if I'm gonna die,
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.
- Good.
- Yeah.
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.
Has it got a name?
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.
Revengers?
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.
Do you want revenge?
I'm undecided.
Okay.
Also, I've got a peace offering.
Surprise.
Just had to be sure.
Hello, Bruce.
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.
Where are you at these days?
It varies from moment to moment.
Is that a Dragonfang?
It is.
My God.
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
apart as any two known systems.
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.
Nope. We are going through the big one.
The Devil's Anus?
Anus?
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
We need another ship.
That will tear mine to pieces.
She's right. We need one that can
withstand the geodetic strain
from the singularity.
And has an offline
power steering system
that could also function
without the on board computer.
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.
What do you say?
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.
Talk about an adventure.
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.
There are one or two ships.
Absolute top of the line models...
I don't mean to impose...
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.
I may even have stolen the access codes
to his security system.
And suddenly you're overcome
with an urge to do the right thing.
Heavens, no.
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster,
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.
You're telling us that you can get us
access into the garage
without setting off any alarms?
Yes, brother. I can.
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.
He did try to kill me.
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.
There was one time
when we were children,
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.
So, I went to pick up the snake
to admire it,
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.
If we're boosting a ship
we're gonna need to draw some guards
away from the palace.
Why not set the beast loose?
Shut up.
You guys have a beast?
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.
We're going to start a revolution.
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.
Is that some sort of protoplasm,
all the stuff that's coming out of you,
or are they eggs?
Looks like eggs.
I'm looking for Korg.
Who's asking?
I know you're asking.
Is there anyone else asking,
or is it just you?
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.
The revolution has begun.
Revolution? How did this happen?
Don't know.
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated
and the slaves have armed themselves.
I don't like that word.
Which? Mainframe?
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?
No, the "S" word.
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.
Okay, that's better.
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.
I disagree.
Open communication
was never our family's forte.
You have no idea.
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.
Hello.
Hi.
Odin brought us together.
It's almost poetic that his death
should split us apart.
We might as well be strangers now.
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.
Here's the thing.
I'm probably better off staying here
on Sakaar.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Did you just agree with me?
Come on, this place is perfect for you.
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...
Brother, you're gonna do great here.
Do you truly think so little of me?
Loki, I thought the world of you.
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.
I don't know,
maybe there's still good in you.
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.
Yeah.
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.
It's what you always wanted.
Hey, let's do "Get Help."
- What?
- "Get Help."
No.
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.
- It's great. It works every time.
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.
We're doing it.
We are not doing "Get Help."
Get help! Please!
My brother, he's dying.
Get help! Help him!
Classic.
Still hate it.
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?
The Commodore.
Right.
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.
Loki.
I know I've betrayed you many times
before,
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.
Never one for sentiment, were you?
Easier to let it burn.
I agree.
That looks painful.
Dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.
I trust you, you betray me.
Round and round in circles we go.
See, Loki, life is about...
It's about growth.
It's about change.
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief,
but you could be more.
I'll just put this over here for you.
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.
All right, I can figure this out.
It's just another spaceship.
Loyal Sakaarians,
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship
and my favorite champion.
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.
Do not let him leave this planet.
- Good shot!
- Thanks.
Open the doors.
Okay.
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.
Why?
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?
Yes, we should.
Where are the guns on this ship?
There aren't any.
- It's a leisure vessel.
- What?
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,
orgies and stuff.
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?
Yeah.
Don't touch anything.
No!
- No!
- No!
Get inside!
In a minute.
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!
Okay, come on.
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.
That looks like a gun.
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
Yeah!
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!
There she is.
Our ticket out of here.
Hey, what's this?
Thank you.
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.
You wanna come?
You do seem like you're
in desperate need of leadership.
Why, thank you.
Here we go.
Shit.
Asgardians...
Some misguided soul
has stolen the Bifrost sword.
Tell us where it is
or there will be consequences.
Bad ones.
Well?
You.
Well? Executioner?
Wait!
Wait!
I know where the sword is.
I never thought I'd be back here.
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.
I mean, not that it's not nice.
It's just, it's on fire.
Here, up here in the mountains.
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.
She's coming for them.
Okay, drop me off at the palace
and I'll draw her away.
And get yourself killed?
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you
two to help get everyone off Asgard.
How the hell are we supposed to do that?
I have a man on the ground.
Asgard.
She's here.
Now the ship has a gun.
I'll take it from here.
I found this in the armory.
Good luck.
Your Majesty...
Don't die.
You know what I mean.
We must keep moving!
Go to the Bifrost!
Sister.
You're still alive.
I love what you've done with the place.
Redecorating, I see.
It seems our father's solution
to every problem was to cover it up.
Or to cast it out.
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.
You see?
You never knew him.
Not at his best.
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations
in blood and tears.
Where do you think all this gold
came from?
And then, one day,
he decided to become a benevolent king.
To foster peace, to protect life.
To have you.
I understand why you're angry.
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.
But it can't be you.
You're just the worst.
Okay, get up.
You're in my seat.
You know, Father once told me
that a wise king never seeks out war.
But must always be ready for it.
Go back!
Go!
To be honest, I expected more.
Heimdall!
The sword!
Here's the difference between us.
I'm Odin's firstborn,
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.
And you're nothing.
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.
Now you remind me of Dad.
The stupid dog won't die!
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.
You wanted to know who I am?
What the hell are you talking about?
You'll see!
You see? No one's going anywhere.
I'll get that sword,
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.
Hey, man.
I'm Korg. This is Miek.
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?
Your savior is here.
Did you miss me?
Everyone, on that ship now.
Welcome home. I saw you coming.
Of course you did.
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.
You see...
I'm not a queen or a monster.
I'm the Goddess of Death.
What were you the god of, again?
Even when you had two eyes,
you'd see only half the picture.
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.
It was never your source of strength.
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.
Asgard is not a place. Never was.
This could be Asgard.
Asgard is where our people stand.
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.
I'm not as strong as you.
No...
You're stronger.
Tell me, brother.
What were you the god of, again?
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.
This isn't over.
I think we should disband the Revengers.
Hit her with a lightning blast.
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.
It did nothing.
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.
It won't end there.
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.
She'll hunt us down.
We need to stop her here and now.
So what do we do?
I'm not doing "Get Help."
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.
Loki,
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.
This was about causing Ragnarok.
Surtur's crown, the vault.
It's the only way.
Bold move, brother.
Even for me.
Shall we?
After you.
This is madness.
Go! Go, now!
For Asgard.
Hela!
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
Hela, enough!
You want Asgard, it's yours.
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.
You can't defeat me.
No, I know.
But he can.
No.
Tremble before me, Asgard!
I am your reckoning!
The people are safe.
That's all that matters.
We're fulfilling the prophecy.
I hate this prophecy.
So do I, but we have no choice.
Surtur destroys Asgard,
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.
But we need to let him finish the job,
otherwise...
No!
Hulk, stop, you moron!
Hulk, stop.
Just for once in your life, don't smash.
Big monster!
Let's go!
Fine.
I am Asgard's doom!
The damage is not too bad.
As long as the foundations
are still strong,
we can rebuild this place.
It will become a haven
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.
What have I done?
You saved us from extinction.
Asgard is not a place...
It's a people.
It suits you.
Maybe you're not so bad after all,
brother.
Maybe not.
Thank you.
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.
I'm here.
Your throne.
So, King of Asgard.
Where to?
I'm not sure.
Any suggestions?
Miek, where are you from?
Miek's dead.
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him
on the bridge.
I've just felt so guilty,
I've been carrying him around all day.
Miek, you're alive!
He's alive, guys.
What was your question again, bro?
Earth it is.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to go back to Earth?
Yes, of course. The people of Earth
love me. I'm very popular.
Let me rephrase that.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to bring me back to Earth?
Probably not, to be honest.
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like
everything's gonna work out fine.
Oh, boy.
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.
Come on. No?
Me too.
'Cause I've been a big part of it.
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.
So, you're welcome.
And it's a tie.

Things are never gonna be
the same now.
I mean, look at this.
You got aliens.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.
Yeah. Tell you what, though.
It ain't bad, is it?
No. Yeah.
Kid's got a future.
Yeah, well...
...we'll see, I guess.
No, hey!
You can't saw through that stuff.
These alien bastards are tough.
You gotta use the stuff they use.
- See? All right.
- All right.
Oh, hey!
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.
Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.
This is a huge deal for us.
Attention, please!
In accordance
with Executive Order 396B...
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
Qualified personnel.
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so-
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under ou rjurisdiction.
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected...
...or you will be prosecuted.
Ma'am, what am-- ?
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.
Look...
...I bought trucks for this job.
I brought in a whole new crew.
These guys have a family.
I have a family.
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.
What'd you say?
Yeah.
He's right. I overextended myself.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.
Put them down.
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?
A joint venture between Stark Industries
and the government...
...the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection...
...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.
Yeah, it's all rigged.
Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material...
...scattered throughout the tri-state area.
Hey, chief!
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?
I ain't hauling it.
It's too bad.
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.
I tell you what.
Let's keep it.
The world's changing.
It's time we change, too.
There you go, Mason.
Business is good.
New York. Queens.
- t's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.
- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.
Then why are you narrating
in that voice?
- Because it's fun.
- Fun.
So why do they call you Happy?
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.
Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?
There's a bathroom on it.
No pilot? That's awesome.
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.
This is your first time
on a private plane?
My first time on any plane.
Should it-- ? Should it be-- ?
Should it be making that noise?
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.
Something about
Captain America going crazy.
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?
We're not roommates. Suit up.
Okay, Peter, you got this.
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.
- Where's the case?
- What case?
What? I thought that was a closet.
- This is still my room?
- Go.
- My room is way bigger than--
- There.
I found the case. I found the case.
"A minor upgrade"?
Oh, my God.
- Put it on.
- What the-- ?
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen--
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.
This is insane. Insane.
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.
Hey, everyone.
The craziest thing just happened.
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him--
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"
And then-- Hey, just a second!
coming!
L- ley-
We have thin walls here.
What are you doing, a little video diary?
- Yeah.
- It's all right.
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.
Hey. You know what?
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.
Three, two, one. Hey, May.
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...
...this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.
Everyone was impressed.
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.
That was a private conversation.
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.
- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line.
- Can you give us a moment?
- Want me to leave?
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.
I can keep the suit?
Yes, we were just talking about it.
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.
I've seen his cardiogram.
- All right?
- Yes.
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.
- This it?
- Seventh floor.
- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?
- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.
So when's our next-- ?
When's our next "retreat," you know?
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?
No, I mean, we'll call you.
Like, someone will call you. All right?
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.
Bye.
They're gonna call me.
What's up, Penis Parker?
Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.
Don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.
Do you have a date for homecoming?
Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Damn it. You, in my office right now.
Join me, and together...
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.
- What?
- So lame.
That's awesome. How many pieces?
Three thousand eight hundred and three.
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark--
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.
Always got that internship.
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.
Here's a gold coin."
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.
That'd be great.
I'm gonna be late.
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...
...between points A and B?
Flash.
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.
Nope. Peter. You still with us?
Yeah, yeah.
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.
You're dead.
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...
...but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing...
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.
Did Liz get a new top?
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.
Too late.
You guys are losers.
Well, then why do you sit with us?
Because I don't have any friends.
Next question.
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?
Hydrogen's the lightest.
That's not the question. Okay.
- Yeah.
- Uranium.
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.
Peter, it's nationals.
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.
Wait. What's happening?
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.
- No, no, no.
- Why not?
Really? Right before nationals?
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.
Flash, you're in for Peter.
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.
I got a hot date
with Black Widow coming up.
That is false.
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Delmar?
Hey, Mr. Parker.
Number five, right?
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.
You got it, boss.
How's your aunt?
Yeah, she's all right.
She's a very hot Italian woman.
How's your daughter?
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.
Here's 5 dollars.
What's up, Murph?
How you doing, buddy?
So how's school?
It's boring. Got better things to do.
Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.
Finally.
- What's the matter with you?
- Could you hold this?
Thanks.
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?
Everybody good?
Hey!
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?
Call me Spider-Man.
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.
- Yeah!
- Not bad.
Hey, buddy.
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumb-ass!
Hey! Shut that off!
- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was--
- I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!
- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know?
- He was putting that in the window!
- Every day with these alarms!
- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there, punk.
Hey, Gary. How you doing?
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?
I'm good, I'm good.
You have reached
the voice-mail box of:
Happy Hogan.
Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.
I just feel like I could be doing more.
You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.
So, yeah, just call me back.
It's Peter. Parker.
Why would I tell him about the churro?
Hey, hey-
Okay.
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.
Oh, nice.
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?
You're the Avengers.
What are you guys doing here?
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.
Hey"
Oh, this feels so weird.
What is that thing?
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.
911. What's your emergency?
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.
Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?
No. Wait, wait, wait!
Mr. Delmar.
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
ls anybody in here? Hello?
Oh, come on.
I gotta--
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.
Okay. Good. Yes.
Yes-- No. No, put that down.
That's worth more
than you or me. Yeah?
The craziest thing just happened.
These guys were robbing an ATM...
- ...with high-tech weapons--
- Take a breath. I don't have time...
- ...for ATM robberies...
- Yeah, but--
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.
Everything's gotta be out next week.
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?
Tony sold Avengers Tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate...
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?
What about you?
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?
- Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?
- Stay away from anything dangerous.
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?
I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap.
- My backpack's gone.
- That doesn't sound responsible.
- I'll call you back.
- Feel free not to.
What was that?
It's nothing. Nothing.
You're the Spider-Man.
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.
You can't just bust into my room!
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.
A thing to do after.
Okay.
Maybe put on some clothes.
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.
Mr. Stark knows
because he made my suit. That's it.
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?
Yeah, basically.
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.
Come on, Ned, please.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I-- Please.
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?
I swear.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
I can't believe this is happening now.
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.
Okay, well, wait, then.
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?
This is the Stark internship.
Just get out of here.
What's the matter?
Thought you loved larb.
It's too larby?
Not larby enough.
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?
You know I larb you.
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.
A lot of work.
The Stark internship.
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.
- Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...
- What does he have you doing?
- ...in an explosion...
- You need to use your instincts.
...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...
What?
...the Spider-Man.
As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...
...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.
Miraculously, no one was harmed.
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Six blocks away from us.
I need a new backpack.
- What?
- I need a new backpack.
That's five.
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.
It's on the house.
Thanks.
That's nice of him.
I think he larbs you.
You got bit by a spider?
Can it bite me?
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.
Maybe. How much did it hurt?
The spider's dead, Ned.
You were here?
Yeah.
You could've died.
Do you lay eggs?
What? No.
- Can you spit venom?
- No.
Can you summon an army of spiders?
No, Ned.
The Sokovia Accords were put
into place...
How far can you shoot your webs?
It's unknown. Shut up.
-- To begin regulating...
If I was you,
I would stand on a building...
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could--
- Shut up, Ned.
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.
...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.
- I stole his shield.
- What?
Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher...
...will conduct
the Captain America Fitness Challenge.
Thank you, Captain.
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.
It's required by the state. Let's do it.
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?
What does Hulk smell like?
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?
Ned, just...okay?
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset...
...telling the other guy where t0 go?
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- I don't need a guy in the chair.
Looking good, Parker.
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.
Well, what about the Spider-Man?
It's just Spider-Man.
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.
Oh, my God,
she's crushing on Spider-Man.
No way.
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.
Like, what if he's seriously burned?
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.
Peter knows Spider-Man.
No, I don't. No. I-- I mean--
They're friends.
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.
But it's...
...through the Stark internship.
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.
It's okay.
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?
What are you doing?
Helping you out.
Did you not hear her?
Liz has a crush on you.
Dude, you're an Avenger.
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.
House party in the suburbs.
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.
It'll be a night to remember.
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.
Yeah, it gives me confidence.
This is a mistake.
Hey, let's just go home.
Oh, Peter.
I know. I know it's really hard...
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.
It's flowering now.
He's so stressed out lately.
What helps with stress is a party.
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.
Peter.
- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.
Bye, May.
Dude, you have the suit, right?
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.
L- ley-
DJ Flash.
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in...
...say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.
Can't believe you're at this lame party.
But you're here too.
Am w.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.
I'm so happy you guys came.
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
- What a great party.
- Thanks.
Oh, I--
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta--
- Yeah.
- Have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Dude, what are you doing?
She's here. Spider it up.
No, no, no. I can't-- I cannot do this.
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.
Peter, no one wants that.
Dude.
Penis Parker, what's up?
So where's your pal Spider-Man?
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?
He must be around..."
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?
What the hell?
This sucks.
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.
Here. You try.
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.
I got antigrav climbers.
Yo, climbers?
Okay, what the hell is that?
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.
All right.
What was that?
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.
Did you just do it again?
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.
Toomes's phone.
Boss.
Oh, my butt!
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.
Hey, hey, buddy.
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.
Now, this is more like it.
Smells really good.
Great movie!
Oh, hey, guys.
NO! No!
Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.
Peter, where are you?
The hat's not working. This is not cool.
Almost got you.
Thought you got away from me,
didn't you?
I got you right where I want you.
Surprise!
What the hell?
Oh, hey.
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?
I put everything in your suit.
Including this heater.
That's better. Thanks.
What were you thinking?
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.
Take him down now, huh?
Crockett, there are people
who handle this son of thing.
- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.
Mr. Stark, you didn't have
to come out here.
I had that. I was fine.
Oh, I'm not here.
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...
...or you would be toast right now.
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.
Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.
- Why?
- Why?
Because I said so!
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.
Stay close to the ground.
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.
Can't you just be a friendly...
...neighborhood Spider-Man?
But I'm ready for more than that now.
No, you're not.
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.
Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.
Are you driving?
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.
I got some pull at MIT. End call.
No, I don't need to go to--
Mr. Stark is no longer connected.
That's awesome.
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."
- Penis!
- Parker!
- Penis!
- Parker!
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
Idiots.
Idiots.
Idiots!
Boss?
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?
Sorry. You left it out.
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?
You're still on that? I told you, no.
The answer's no. Forget it.
I mean, that was badass.
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.
Under the radar!
That's how we survive.
If you bring Damage Control
or the Avengers down here, we're through.
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars...
...calling yourself the Shocker.
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?
Whatever, old man. Come on.
Look.
Look.
I know you don't give a crap
about anything.
But I do.
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I can't afford your bullshit.
- Get out of here.
- What?
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.
All right.
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?
With everything I know.
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying...
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.
- You know what?
- What?
You're right.
- That work?
- I don't know.
I can't afford that.
Wait.
Damn.
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?
No, that's that one.
Here.
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.
All right.
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.
Yeah, well, something came up.
What is that?
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Awesome.
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.
So scary.
Well, look, I think it's...
...a power source.
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.
That's an inductive charging plate. That's
what I use to charge my toothbrush.
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey...
...into this amazing--
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.
We'll go to the lab after class
and run tests.
Let's do it.
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.
We gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy."
You're right.
Crap.
Come on, come on, come on.
High schools creep me out.
They got this funny smell, you know?
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.
What?
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.
- Peter--
- No. Stay there, Ned.
Peter.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Yeah. You good?
Chess.
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.
There's no sign of the weapon.
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.
This is so awesome.
I know, right?
They're in Brooklyn.
Staten Island.
Leaving Jersey.
They stopped.
Maryland?
- What's there?
- I don't know.
Evil lair?
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.
Badass.
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?
It's not too far from D.C.
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.
No, no way. You can't quit on us...
...stroll up and be welcomed back
by everyone.
Hey, welcome back!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.
- What?
- He's taking your place.
Excuse me, can we go already?
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.
Focus up.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.
The second law of thermodynamics.
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.
Liz, don't overwork them.
Strontium, barium, vibranium.
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.
Glad to be back.
- What is the current standard unit of-- ?
- Can I take this real quick?
Yeah, fine.
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker.
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...
...is a complete violation of privacy.
- That's different.
- What's different?
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.
- It's no big deal.
- Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.
You kidding me? This place is huge.
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?
Peter...
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?
I gotta follow these guys to their boss
before they move again...
...and I don't really want Mr. Stark
to know about it.
So you're lying to Iron Man now?
No, I'm not lying.
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.
Gotcha.
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here...
...but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.
What?
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.
- t's not cool.
- But you are a kid.
A kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.
I mean, what if this is illegal?
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.
I can handle it. Ned, come on.
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.
- Don't do that.
- Come on.
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.
- They're moving.
- Be careful.
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.
We're gonna go swimming.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.
L- ley-
I was-- I was gonna go study
in the business center.
You don't need to.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.
And besides...
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so--
I-- I heard it in a TED Talk.
And I read a coaching book.
You really--
This is really important to you.
Yeah. It's our future.
I'm not gonna screw it up.
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
Let's go.
- Good evening, Peter.
- Hello? Hello?
Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...
...and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.
Thank you.
Where would you like
to take me tonight?
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.
Tracker located.
Plotting course to intercept target.
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.
One hundred meters
from destination and closing.
Jump now.
Detecting three individuals.
Why is their secret lair
in a gas station? That's so lame.
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?
Do you want to hear
what they're saying?
I can hear what they're saying? Yeah.
Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design.
Whoa, that's so cool.
Can't believe they're still cleaning up
that Triskelion mess.
I love it. They keep making messes...
- ...we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.
They're in the middle of a heist.
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.
Okay, I'll get closer
to see what's happening.
Would you like me
to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?
"Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.
Activating instant Kill.
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.
Deactivating Instant Kill.
Did you hear that?
What the hell just happened?
What was that?
You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.
What's wrong with my web-shooters?
Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
- Would you like to see more options?
You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.
Mr. Stark really overdid it.
You two wait right here.
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?
- That one.
- Great choice.
Would you like me to set this
as your new default?
No, no, no.
- Push that in. No, the other--
- Here? This one here?
- What was that?
- Taser webs.
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.
You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.
Would you like to run
a refresher course?
- No. Just-- You choose.
- Sure thing.
Six-alpha-niner,
are you running on time?
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.
Oh, that's him.
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.
Pulling in behind the caboose.
Deploy anchors.
Dropping down.
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.
All right, coming up.
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.
Oh, God.
- Suit lady, what was that?!
- You told me to choose.
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.
Activating all systems.
My head.
You appear to have a mild concussion.
Hey, so where am I right now?
I'm not sure.
The container walls are hindering
my sensors.
Wait a minute.
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have
to fight our way out of this one.
Three, two, one.
What is this place?
Suit lady, where am I?
You're in the most secure facility
on the eastern seaboard.
The Damage Control deep storage vault.
No. Seriously?
The door will most likely remain closed
until morning.
Morning?
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?
I think I should probably give you a name.
Like Liz. No, no, no.
God, that's-- That's weird.
What about Karen?
You can call me Karen
if you would like.
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?
What?
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.
- Ricochet web.
- Ricochet web.
- Cool.
- Splitter web.
- Web grenade.
- Web grenade!
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?
Who is Liz?
Who's Liz? She's--
She's the best. She's awesome.
She's just a girl who goes to my school.
And--
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."
What's weird about that?
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.
Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.
Thanks, Karen.
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.
Hey, how long we been here anyways?
- Thirty-seven minutes-
- What?!
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.
I cannot take this anymore.
I got t0-- I gotta get out of here.
There's got t0 be something in here
I can use.
Okay, let's see.
Nope.
That's awesome.
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.
That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?
t would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.
No, no, no.
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.
Trial unsuccessful.
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.
Okay. Hold on, hold on.
Initiating trial 247.
It worked. It works.
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.
Thank you.
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.
Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.
- It's Ned. Leave a message.
- Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!
There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.
We have now entered sudden death.
The next correct answer wins
the championship.
Midtown Tech?
Zero.
That is correct.
Midtown takes the championship.
- We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just--
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by--
Okay.
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?
- t's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.
- Listen.
- We're at the Washington Monument.
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.
- Is that Liz?
- Put Ned back on the phone.
- You should tell her how you feel.
- You flake. You are lucky we won.
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.
- All items on the belt, please.
- There's something in Ned's backpack.
It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through x-ray.
Liz? Liz! Damn it.
Can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?
The Chitauri core has detonated...
...and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.
Just stay calm, everyone.
Oh, we are all going to die here.
Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.
We're freaking screwed.
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.
The safety systems
are completely failing.
We're very safe in here.
The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.
Going as fast as I can!
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.
You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.
What?! Why?
Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.
- How do I get in there?
- Activating reconnaissance drone.
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.
Locating optimal entry point.
Proceed to southwest window.
Karen, I'm on my way.
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Okay. Oh, my God.
Okay.
What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.
- Why are you hesitating?
- It's fine.
I've just never been this high before.
You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...
...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.
Perfect.
Oh, my God.
Why is it not breaking?
It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.
My friends are in there! Stop!
Return to the ground immediately.
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.
Stand down!
Return to the ground immediately.
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!
Go up, 90 UP-
I got this.
Take my trophy.
This is your last chance.
I'm gonna die.
Break!
I did it.
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Let's go, let's go!
Okay, Okay-
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.
- This is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.
Liz!
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay.
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.
- Come on in.
- You guys good?
So is everyone okay?
This is your chance, Peter.
Kiss her.
Thank you.
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck...
Yeah, damn it.
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?
Yeah, but then that's it.
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.
No.
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those...
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.
Really?
I'm gonna kill him.
- I'm gonna find him--
- Found him.
The Spider-Man swooped in...
...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.
The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.
Peter. Come here,
come here, come here.
This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...
...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.
Later that day,
they also defeated death.
Explosion. Salty scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.
There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.
As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.
I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.
Not again.
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.
How can you show your spider spirit?
Dude, dude, dude.
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.
Dude, listen, I figured it out.
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.
Ned, I'm probably never gonna
come back here.
Mr. Stark is moving
the Avengers upstate...
- ...so when I bring this guy in--
- Dude.
You want to be a high school dropout?
I am so far beyond high school right now.
Parker, my office.
So...
...you got detention.
You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.
The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?
Maybe you were trying to be cool.
But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...
...the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.
We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.
Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...
- ...you know is wrong...
- Where you going? Get back here.
...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.
It's you.
So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.
May?
Hey, Karen. What's up?
Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?
I was wondering if you could help me.
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.
I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.
- Footage?
- Yes, Peter.
I record everything you see.
- Everything?
- Everything.
- All the time?
- It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.
Yeah, of course it is.
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
- With pleasure.
Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.
Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.
Go later in the day, later in the day.
It is I, Thor, son of Odin.
No, no, no. That's definitely--
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.
- Your impressions are very funny.
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.
Okay.
- The two on the right, who are they?
- Searching law enforcement databases.
No records found
for two of the individuals.
Nothing'?
- One individual identified.
Aaron Davis, age 33.
He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.
Let's pay him a visit.
Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?
Yeah.
- Remember me?
- Hey--
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.
- All right, chill.
- Come on!
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man.
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl--
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?
I need to know. Give me names or else.
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.
Look, man.
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.
They can't be out on the streets.
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half--
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- It's too much bread.
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.
The other night, you told that dude,
"if you shoot somebody, shoot me."
That's pretty ballsy.
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.
I got a nephew who live here.
Who are these guys?
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.
I don't know who he is
or where he is.
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with...
...he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.
Yes! Yes.
- Thank--
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just--
Yeah.
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?
You got to get better
at this part of the job.
I don't understand.
I'm intimidating.
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.
No, no, no. Come fix this.
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.
Nice.
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
Sure thing.
He's up front, main deck.
I hate this guy.
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?
Just keep me posted.
There's no record of him
in my criminal database.
Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.
- Who's the guy on the left?
- Mac Gargan.
Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.
Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.
White pickup truck.
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.
Oh, this is too perfect.
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.
- Incoming call from Tony Stark.
- No, no, no.
Don't answer.
- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
- I'm actually at school.
- No, you're not.
- Nice work in D. C.
- Okay.
My dad never really gave me
a lot of support...
...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.
I'm in the middle of something.
Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.
Anyway, great things are about to-
What is that?
I'm at band practice.
That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?
- I gotta go. End call.
- Hey.
I'll take those!
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry
was at 10:30. You missed it.
Spider guy's here.
Not so fast.
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.
I got to say, the other guy was way better
with that thing.
I'm honestly--
I'm-- I'm shocked.
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.
What do you mean, FBI?
- The Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- I know, but what are they doing here?
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!
No.
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.
We're getting out of here.
Activate Taser web!
You're messing with things
you don't understand.
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.
Web grenade. Web grenade.
Splitter web, go.
Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!
No, no, no.
What the hell?
What the hell?
Hi, Spider-Man.
Band practice, was it?
Yeah, Iron Man!
Mr. Stark.
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?
I think you've done enough.
So that's it. You're just gonna run?
Feds were waiting for us.
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?
Yeah, I'm running.
You should too.
You know I can't do that.
So now what?
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?
Seriously?
Yes. You will not regret this.
You in?
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch...
.../ tell you to stay away from this.
Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...
...so you could sneak around
behind my back...
...doing the one thing
I told you not to do.
ls everyone okay?
No thanks to you.
No thanks to me?
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...
...but you didn't listen.
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.
And if you died...
...I feel like that's on me.
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.
I just wanted to be like you.
And I wanted you to be better.
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.
- For how long?
- Forever.
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.
- Let's have it.
- Please, this is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Okay?
God, I sound like my dad.
I don't have any other clothes.
Okay, we'll sort that out.
L- ley-
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.
You can't do that.
Then this ferry thing happens.
I've called five police stations.
Five.
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.
Cut the bullshit.
I know you left detention.
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.
That's not fine.
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.
It's just me and you.
I lost the Stark internship.
- What?
- Yeah.
What happened?
I just thought that I could work really hard
and he could-- He would-- You know.
But I screwed it up.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I made you worry.
I'm not trying to ruin your life.
Yeah, I know.
Just--
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.
And take a shower. You smell.
You smell like garbage.
I know.
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?
Okay.
All right, get out of here.
Are you expelled?
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.
You're so lucky.
L- ley-
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.
Hey, look, I--
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.
It's fine.
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.
No, I'm--
I just mean that...
...it was not cool, especially...
...because...
...I like you.
I know.
You do?
You're terrible at keeping secrets.
Yeah, you'd be surprised.
I got to get to class, but--
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...
...forever, but--
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so--
Do you want to...
...go with me?
Yeah. Sure.
Really? I mean, great. Cool.
Cool.
I'm actually going that way.
May, I need your help.
Through or around?
Right?
It's game day. So, what's the plan?
Open the door for her.
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.
- Don't be creepy.
- No.
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.
I got this.
- Love you.
- Bye.
You must be Peter.
Yeah.
I'm Liz's dad.
Put her there.
Hell of a grip.
Come on in here. Come on.
Hi, Peter.
You look very handsome.
Thank you.
You got his name right?
- Freddie?
- Peter.
Peter. Peter.
I'm gonna go get Liz.
Okay.
You all right, Pete?
Yeah.
Because you look pale.
You want something to drink?
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?
I'm not old enough to drink.
That's the right answer.
- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.
Doesn't she, Pete?
Yeah, you look really good.
Once again, that's the right answer.
Is that a corsage?
Thanks.
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.
Okay. Come on, you guys.
Peter, closer.
Smile.
There you go.
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.
I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.
- Thank you.
- Promise.
He's cute.
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.
Come on, Pedro.
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.
Just saying, you know.
All you guys who go to that school...
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.
Really? Stark?
So cool.
What do you do?
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got...
...boring.
It was boring?
You got to hang outwith Spider-Man.
Really? Spider-Man?
What's he like?
Yeah, he's nice.
Nice man.
Solid dude.
Look. So cute.
I've seen you around, right? I mean...
...somewhere. We've-- Have we ever-- ?
Because even the voice--
He does Academic Decathlon with me.
And he was at my party.
It was a great party, really great, yeah.
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.
That was-- I was there longer
than two seconds.
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.
Were you scared?
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...
...showed up in the elevator though, huh?
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.
I saw it all from the ground.
Yeah.
Very lucky that he was there that day.
Good old Spider-Man.
Dad, the light.
Here we are. End of the line.
Thanks, Dad.
You head in there, gumdrop.
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.
Don't let him intimidate you.
Love you.
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.
Hi.
You guys look so pretty.
Does she know?
Know what?
So she doesn't. Good.
Close t0 the vest.
I admire that.
I've got a few secrets of my own.
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...
Peter...
...nothing is more important than family.
You saved my daughter's life.
I could never forget something like that.
So I'm gonna give you one chance.
Are you ready?
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...
...and don't you ever, ever...
...interfere with my business again.
Because if you do...
...I'll kill you...
...and everybody you love.
I'll kill you dead.
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?
L- ley-
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?
Just not too good.
L- ley-
What did he say to you?
Gotta go.
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this.
He gave you a choice.
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?
What's with the crappy costume?
My web-shooters.
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but damn.
Gross.
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.
Nice shot!
Yes!
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.
Get a computer and track my phone.
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...
...before he leaves town.
I'm sorry about dinner...
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So--
Flash, I need your car and phone.
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't--
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?
- Go for Ned.
- Ned, I need you...
- ...to track my phone.
- Yeah, but where is it?
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. it's--
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move!
Are you okay'?
- I've never driven before...
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.
Hey, have you gotten through
to Happy yet?
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
Guy in the chair.
Takeoff in nine minutes.
Hello? Hello? Who Is this?
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
- Who?
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you--
You gotta be shitting me.
Damn.
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.
Left, okay.
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.
It sounded like he was catching a flight.
He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.
- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.
Boxes? It's moving day.
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.
I gotta stop him!
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster Armor...
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging--
The Meg-- The--
Thor's magic belt.
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.
- What?
- Turn right.
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.
I'm...
...looking...
...at porn.
Hey!
Surprised?
Oh, hey, Pete.
I didn't hear you come in.
It's over. I've got you.
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...
...I really, really admire your grit.
I see why Liz likes you.
I do. When you first came to the house...
...I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.
How could you do this to her?
To her?
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.
I'm doing this for her.
Yeah.
Peter...
...you're young.
You don't understand
how the world works.
But I understand that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.
How do you think
your buddy Stark paid for that tower?
Or any of his little toys?
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.
Guys like us...
...like you and me...
...they don't care about us.
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.
That's how it is.
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to understand.
And...
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.
I'm sorry, Peter.
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.
True. Then again...
...wasn't really trying to.
Chief, they're powering up engines.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, ready?
Hello?
Hello!
Please, hey.
Hey, please. I'm down here.
I'm down here. I'm stuck.
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't--
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Come on, Peter.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man!
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.
Oh, yeah.
Retroreflective panels engaged.
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.
It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.
Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.
This better work, Mason.
Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life.
Yeah.
You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...
...and override their security.
Cloning transponder signal.
Launching decoy drone.
Entering new coordinates.
Good, so it's on its way.
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.
All right.
Hot dog.
Just a typical homecoming...
...on the outside of an invisible jet...
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.
Oh, God!
I can't believe that worked.
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.
I'm not going home empty-handed.
Oh, my God.
- Get out of there. What are you doing?
- Please turn, please turn!
Hey, Pedro.
Bingo.
Your wingsuit.
Your wingsuit's going to explode!
Time to go home, Pete.
I'm trying to save you!
No.
No.
It looked so insane. That whole--
Like, it was just crazy.
He-- He was just, like...
And you were like...
And then I just hit him with the...
It was so-- Oh, my God.
I mean, you saved me.
It was awesome.
Hey, Liz.
I'm gonna miss you.
Bye.
Liz.
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?
The dance?
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.
Well, yeah, but I--
I mean, your dad-- I can't imagine
what you're going through.
If there's anything I can do to help...
I guess we're moving to Oregon.
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So...
Liz, I-- I--
Bye, Peter.
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.
Yeah!
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...
...but just for motivation right now
at this practice.
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...
...a new team captain next year.
So I am appointing Michelle.
Yeah!
Thank you.
My-- My friends call me MJ.
I thought you didn't have any friends.
I didn't.
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?
What are you hiding, Peter?
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.
Hey, Happy. What-- ?
What are you doing here?
I really owe you one.
I don't know what I would do
without this job.
I mean, before I met Tony--
So how long you been here?
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.
Upstate-- Like, upstate-upstate?
Yeah, let's go.
Take a look.
It's pretty impressive, huh?
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.
How was the ride up?
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
I gotta talk to the kid.
I'll be close behind.
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.
Sorry I took your suit.
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...
...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.
- Mr. Stark, I really--
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.
But then you did the right thing.
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...
All right, not my best analogy.
I was wrong about you.
I think, with a little more mentoring...
...you could be a real asset to the team.
- To the-- ? To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.
When you're ready...
...why don't you try that on?
And I'll introduce the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:
Spider-Man.
'Can-
Yeah, give that a look.
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...
...your new quarters.
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.
Or walls.
You'll fit right in.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
But I'm good.
You're good? Good-- ?
How are you good?
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?
You're turning me down?
You better think about this.
Look at that.
Look at me.
Last chance. Yes or no?
- No.
- Okay.
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.
Happy will take you home.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.
- See you around.
- Okay.
That was a test, right?
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
Yeah, thank you.
Told you he's a good kid.
- Where's the kid?
- He left.
- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?
Think of something. How about...?
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I-- ? I-- ?
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?
I've been carrying this since 2008.
Okay.
I think I can think
of something better than that.
Well, it would buy us a little time.
Like we need time.
I can't believe you have that
in your pocket.
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?
May?
What 'the-l?!
Look who it is.
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?
Relax.
This? It's not on you.
It's on our little spider friend.
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.
And I heard a rumor.
You know who he is.
If I knew who he was...
...he'd already be dead.
Toomes, your family's here!
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.
Patience.
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.
Sometimes it leads to very little...
...and it seems like it's not worth it.
And you wonder...
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.
How many more of these?

2
This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel Statesman.
We are under assault.
I repeat,
we are under assault.
The engines are dead,
life support failing.
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.
We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.
Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.
We have
very few soldiers here.
This is not a warcraft.
I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.
Hear me and rejoice.
You have had the privilege
of being saved
by the Great Titan.
You may think
this is suffering.
No.
It is salvation.
Universal scales
tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.
Smile.
For even in death,
you have become
Children of Thanos.
I know what it's like to lose.
To feel so desperately
that you're right...
yet to fail, nonetheless.
It's frightening.
Turns the legs to jelly.
But I ask you, to what end?
Dread it, run from it...
destiny arrives all the same.
And now, it's here.
Or should I say...
I am.
You talk too much.
The Tesseract.
Or your brother's head.
I assume you have
a preference.
Oh, I do.
Kill away.
All right, stop!
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.
You really are
the worst brother.
I assure you, brother...
the sun will shine
on us again.
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.
And for another...
we have a Hulk.
Let him have his fun.
Allfathers...
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...
time.
That was a mistake.
No!
You're going to die for that.
Shh.
My humble personage...
bows before your grandeur.
No other being
has ever had the might...
nay, the nobility...
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.
The universe lies
within your grasp.
There are two more stones
on Earth.
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.
Father,
we will not fail you.
If I might interject.
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.
If you consider
failure experience.
I consider
experience experience.
Almighty Thanos...
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...
Odinson...
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...
god of mischief...
do hereby pledge to you...
my undying fidelity.
Undying?
You should choose your words
more carefully.
You...
will never be...
a god.
No!
No resurrections this time.
No. Loki.
Seriously,
you don't have any money?
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.
Dollars?
- Rupees.
- Which is?
Uh, buck and a half.
What do you want?
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.
Thanos is coming.
He's coming.
Who?
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.
You're totally rambling.
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,
and in the dream
you gotta pee.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."
And then you wake up
and in real life
you actually have to pee.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.
It was so real.
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.
Uh, what was his name?
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.
...and thought that we were...
- Expecting.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- No.
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.
If you wanted to have a kid...
you wouldn't have done that.
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.
You're not helping
your case, okay?
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...
You don't need that.
I know, I had the surgery.
I'm just
trying to protect us...
and future usses
and that's it.
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.
You know me so well.
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.
You should have shirts
in your closet.
Yeah.
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.
Show off this Harry Winston.
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.
I should promise you.
- Yes.
- I will.
Thank you.
Tony Stark.
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?
We need your help.
It's not overselling it
to say that
the fate of the universe
is at stake.
And who's "we"?
Hey, Tony.
Bruce.
- Pepper.
- Hi.
- Oh.
- You okay?
At the dawn
of the universe,
there was nothing. Then...
Boom.
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...
hurtling across
the virgin universe.
These Infinity Stones
each control an essential
aspect of existence.
Space.
Reality.
Power.
Soul.
Mind.
And Time.
Tell me his name again.
Thanos.
He's a plague, Tony.
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.
He wipes out
half the population.
He sent Loki.
The attack on New York,
that's him.
This is it.
What's our timeline?
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.
That already makes him
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...
He could destroy life
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Is that what it is?
I'm going to allow that.
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?
No can do.
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.
And I swore off dairy...
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.
A bit chalky.
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.
Point is, things change.
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.
Yeah, so conversely,
it may also be
his best chance against us.
Well, if we don't do our jobs.
What is your job exactly?
Besides making
balloon animals.
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?
The fact is
we have this stone.
We know where it is.
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...
and we have to find him now.
Yeah, that's the thing.
What do you mean?
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.
He's offline.
- What?
- Yeah.
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.
Who could find Vision then?
Shit.
Probably Steve Rogers.
Oh, great.
Maybe.
But...
Call him.
It's not that easy.
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?
No.
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.
Broke up?
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?
Cap and I fell out hard.
We're not on speaking terms.
Tony, listen to me.
Thor's gone.
Thanos is coming.
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.
Flip phone.
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be
moving your hair, would ya?
Not at the moment, no.
You okay?
- Help him!
- Banner!
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!
Friday, what am I looking at?
Not sure.
I'm working on it.
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone
in your back pocket, Doc!
Might wanna use it.
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.
Holy shit.
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!
What's the matter
with you kids?
You never seen
a spaceship before?
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.
Notify first responders.
Will do.
Hear me and rejoice.
You are about to die
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.
Be thankful...
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.
You better pack it up
and get outta here.
Stonekeeper.
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.
He means get lost, Squidward.
He exhausts me.
Bring me the stone.
Banner, you want a piece?
Mmm, no, not really.
But when do I ever get
what I want?
That's right.
Okay. Push!
It's been a while.
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.
Okay. Shh.
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.
Come on, come on, man.
God!
Where's your guy?
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.
It's okay.
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.
- I have him.
- Damn it.
Where'd that come from?
It's nanotech.
You like it?
A little something I...
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend
won't be joining us...
Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.
It stays with me.
Exactly. Bye.
Tony, you okay?
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?
I'm trying. He won't come out.
Hammer.
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?
Come out! Come out! Come out!
No!
What do you mean, "no"?
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?
Uh, he's from space.
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.
Your powers are quaint.
You must be popular
with children.
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.
You'll only wish
you were dead.
No!
Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.
On it!
Not cool.
Gotcha!
Wait!
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.
Hang on, kid.
Oh!
Ugh.
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.
Give me a little juice,
Friday.
Unlock 17:A.
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.
But you said
save the wizard!
I can't breathe.
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.
Yeah. That makes sense.
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!
Happy trails, kid.
- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.
Oh, come on!
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.
Tony? Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
What's going on?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.
Why?
Just 'cause
I'll probably
not make it back for a while.
Tell me
you're not on that ship.
Yeah.
God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.
Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.
- Pep.
- Come back here right now.
Come back.
Boss,
we're losing her.
I'm going too.
Oh, my God!
I shoulda stayed on the bus.
Where you going?
The Time Stone's been taken.
The Sanctum remains unguarded.
What will you do?
I'm gonna make a call.
Sing it, Drax!
Why are we doing this again?
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.
Someone could be dying.
I get that,
but why are we doing it?
'Cause we're nice.
And maybe whoever it is
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...
We take his ship.
- Exactly!
- Bingo!
All right!
We are arriving.
All right, Guardians,
don't forget
this might be dangerous...
so let's put on
our mean faces.
Groot, put that
thing away, now.
I don't wanna tell you again.
Groot.
I am Groot!
- Whoa!
- Language!
- Hey!
- Wow.
You got some
acorns on you, kid.
Ever since
you got a little sap,
you're a total d-hole.
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Looks like
we're not getting paid.
Wipers! Wipers!
Get it off.
How the hell
is this dude still alive?
He is not a dude.
You're a dude.
This... This is a man.
A handsome, muscular man.
I'm muscular.
But who are you
kidding, Quill?
You're one sandwich
away from fat.
Yeah, right.
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.
What?
Gamora, do you think I'm...
He is anxious, angry.
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.
Wow.
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?
It's like his muscles
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.
Stop massaging his muscles.
Wake him up.
Wake.
Who the hell are you guys?
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.
To bring balance
to the universe
by wiping out
half of all life.
He used to kill people
planet by planet,
massacre by massacre.
Including my own.
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.
Your father killed my brother.
Oh, boy.
Stepfather, technically.
And she hates him
as much as you do.
Families can be tough.
Before my father died,
he told me
that I had a half-sister...
that he imprisoned in Hel.
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.
So I had to kill her.
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.
Goes round and round and...
I feel your pain.
I feel your pain as well,
because...
I mean,
it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.
My father killed my mother.
And then I had to kill
my father.
That was hard.
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...
I need a hammer, not a spoon.
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.
No, you're not.
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?
- No.
- You are.
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.
No, I'm not.
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.
Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.
He's trying to copy me.
I need you to stop doing that.
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.
We need to stop Thanos.
Which means
we need to find out
where he's going next.
Knowhere.
He must be going somewhere.
No, no. Knowhere?
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?
Because for years...
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there
with a man
called the Collector.
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...
he's not going
for one of the other stones?
There are six stones
out there.
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.
He stole the Space Stone
from me...
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.
Like Kevin Bacon?
He may be on the team.
I don't know.
I haven't been there
in a while.
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.
No one even knows where it is.
Therefore Thanos can't get it.
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?
That place is a legend.
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons
to ever torment the universe.
I would very much like
to go there, please.
The rabbit is correct
and clearly the smartest
among you.
Rabbit?
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.
I assume
you're the captain, sir.
You're very perceptive.
You seem like a noble leader.
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.
Quiet.
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.
Look, this is my ship.
And I'm not goin' to...
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?
The Thanos-killing kind.
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.
Your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed
into madness.
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.
If we don't go to Knowhere
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...
he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.
We got two ships
and a large assortment
of morons.
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.
And the morons
will go to Knowhere
to try to stop Thanos.
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.
For the record...
I know that
you're going with him
because it's where
Thanos isn't.
You know, you really shouldn't
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.
Come on, Groot.
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.
Bye.
Vis?
Is it the stone again?
It's as if
it's speaking to me.
What does it say?
I don't... I don't know,
but something.
Hey.
Tell me what you feel.
I just feel you.
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...
which would give us more time
together before you went back.
What if
I miss that train?
There's an 11:00.
What if I missed
all the trains?
What if this time
I didn't go back?
But you gave Stark your word.
I'd rather give it to you.
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.
We both made promises.
Not to each other.
Wanda.
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...
trying to see
if this could work and...
I don't know.
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.
I think...
- It works.
- It works.
It works.
Stay.
Stay with me.
Or not. If I'm overstepping...
What are they?
What the stone
was warning me about.
I have to go.
No, Vision.
Vision, if that's true,
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.
Wanda, I...
Vision!
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.
My systems are failing.
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.
Vis!
Give up the stone,
and she lives.
Hands off.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, you gotta get up.
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.
Hey. We have to go.
Please. Please leave.
You asked me to stay.
- I'm staying.
- Please.
- Get up.
- I can't.
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.
You'll never get
the chance again.
Can you stand?
Thank you, Captain.
Let's get you on the jet.
Now, I thought we had a deal.
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.
I'm sorry.
We just wanted time.
Where to, Cap?
Home.
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.
Zehobereians.
Mother! Where's my mother?
Choose a side or die.
Mother!
One side
is a revelation...
the other an honor
known only to a few.
What's wrong, little one?
My mother. Where is my mother?
What's your name?
Gamora.
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.
Come.
Let me help you.
Look.
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.
Too much to one side
or the other...
Here. You try.
Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.
Uh-uh.
Concentrate.
There. You've got it.
Gamora.
Do you know if these grenades
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?
Because I was thinking about
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.
But I don't want to
if they're the...
I need to ask a favor.
Yeah, sure.
One way or another,
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.
Which is what
the grenades are for.
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?
If things go wrong...
If Thanos gets me...
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.
What?
I know something he doesn't.
And if he finds it out,
the entire universe
could be at risk.
What do you know?
If I tell you, you'd know too.
If it's so important...
shouldn't I?
Only if you wanna die.
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?
Just...
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would. But you...
Swear to me.
Swear to me on your mother.
Okay.
Okay.
- Oh.
- Dude.
How long have you been
standing there?
An hour.
An hour?
Are you serious?
I've mastered the ability
of standing
so incredibly still...
that I become
invisible to the eye.
Watch.
You're eating a zarg-nut.
But my movement...
was so slow...
that it's imperceptible.
Mmm, no.
I'm sure I'm invisible.
Hi, Drax.
Damn it.
This place looks deserted.
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.
Yep,
I'm picking that up too.
Let's put down right here.
I don't have it.
Everyone
in the galaxy knows
you'd sell your own brother...
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...
to your pathetic collection.
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.
I told you.
I sold it.
Why would I lie?
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.
Like suicide.
You do understand.
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.
I didn't know what it was.
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.
It's him.
Last chance,
charlatan.
Where's the stone?
Today...
Drax. Drax.
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.
Drax, wait.
Not yet, not yet, not yet.
Drax.
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.
He doesn't have the stone yet.
If we get it,
then we can stop him.
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.
No.
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.
Sleep.
Okay.
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.
The other right.
Why?
Why you, daughter?
That was quick.
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!
Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.
But one never knows for sure.
Reality is often
disappointing.
That is, it was.
Now...
reality can be
whatever I want.
You knew I'd come.
I counted on it.
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.
Thanos!
No!
Let her go, Grimace.
Peter.
I told you to go right.
Now? Really?
You let her go!
Ah, the boyfriend.
No.
Like to think of myself
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.
- Let her go.
- Peter.
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.
Not him.
You promised. You promised.
Oh, daughter.
You expect too much from him.
She's asked, hasn't she?
Do it.
Mmm.
Do it!
I told you to go right.
I love you more than anything.
I love you too.
I like him.
Still no word from Vision?
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.
On a stolen Quinjet
with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.
You know they're
only criminals because
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?
My God, Rhodes.
Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.
If it weren't
for those Accords,
Vision would've been
right here.
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.
That's right.
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.
You have second thoughts?
Not anymore.
Mr. Secretary.
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.
You could use
some of that right now.
The world's on fire.
And you think all is forgiven?
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.
And I'm way past
asking permission.
Earth just lost
her best defender.
So we're here to fight.
And if you wanna
stand in our way...
we'll fight you too.
Arrest them.
All over it.
That's a court-martial.
It's great to see you, Cap.
You too, Rhodey.
Hey.
Wow. You guys...
really look like crap.
Must've been
a rough couple years.
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.
Uh, I think
you look great.
Uh...
Yeah, I'm back.
Hi, Bruce.
Nat.
This is awkward.
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?
And they can clearly find us.
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?
After the whole
Accords situation,
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough
on their families.
They're on house arrest.
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?
Okay, look.
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...
Vision's stone.
Then we have to protect it.
No, we have to destroy it.
I've been giving
a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head.
About its nature.
But also its composition.
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...
its molecular integrity
could fail.
Yeah, and you with it.
We're not having
this conversation.
Eliminating the stone
is the only way
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.
That's too high a price.
Only you have
the power to pay it.
Thanos threatens
half the universe.
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.
But it should.
We don't trade lives, Vision.
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...
to save how many
millions of people?
Tell me,
why is this any different?
Because you might
have a choice.
Your mind is made up
of a complex construct
of overlays.
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.
All of them mixed together,
all of them
learning from one another.
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.
Perhaps the best parts.
Can we do that?
Not me, not here.
Well,
you better find someone
and somewhere fast.
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys
have your old rooms back.
I know somewhere.
The Kingsguard
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.
And the Border Tribe?
Those that are left.
Send word
to the Jabari as well.
M'Baku likes a good fight.
And what of this one?
This one may be tired of war.
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.
Where's the fight?
On its way.
In all the time
I've served Thanos...
I have never failed him.
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...
with the Time Stone
still attached
to your vaguely
irritating person...
there would be judgment.
Give me...
the stone.
Wow, you're a seriously
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?
Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...
What the...
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.
God damn it.
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.
And now, I'm here in space.
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.
This is a one-way ticket.
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.
No, I did think this through.
You could not have possibly
thought this through.
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...
if there's no neighborhood.
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,
but you know
what I'm trying to say.
Come on. We got a situation.
See him down there?
He's in trouble.
What's your plan?
- Go.
- Um...
Okay, okay... Uh...
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?
Painful, aren't they?
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.
And any one of them...
could end your friend's life
in an instant.
I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.
You've saved nothing.
Your powers
are inconsequential
compared to mine.
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.
Yes! Wait.
What are those?
Hey,
we haven't officially met.
Cool.
We gotta turn
this ship around.
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.
No, I want to protect
the stone.
And I want you
to thank me.
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.
I seriously don't know
how you fit your head
into that helmet.
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.
I tried to bench you.
You refused.
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.
And due to that fact,
we're now
in a flying doughnut...
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.
What is he, your ward?
No.
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...
I'm Spider-Man, then.
This ship is
self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.
Can we control it?
Fly us home?
- Stark?
- Yeah.
Can you get us home?
Yeah, I heard you.
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.
Under no circumstances
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.
I don't think
you quite understand
what's at stake here.
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.
Since he sent an army
to New York
and now he's back.
And I don't know what to do.
So I'm not so sure
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.
So I say we take
the fight to him.
Doctor.
Do you concur?
All right, Stark.
We go to him.
But you have to understand...
if it comes to saving you
or the kid
or the Time Stone...
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.
Nice. Good, moral compass.
We're straight.
All right, kid.
You're an Avenger now.
I thought
you might be hungry.
I always hated that chair.
So I've been told.
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.
I hated this room.
This ship.
I hated my life.
You told me that too.
Every day.
For almost 20 years.
I was a child
when you took me.
I saved you.
No.
No. We were happy
on my home planet.
Going to bed hungry...
scrounging for scraps.
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.
Do you know
what's happened since then?
The children born...
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.
Because you murdered
half the planet.
A small price to pay
for salvation.
You're insane.
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.
It needs correction.
You don't know that!
I'm the only one
who knows that.
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.
For a time...
you had that same will...
as you fought by my side.
Daughter.
I'm not your daughter.
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.
And, in doing so,
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
I am disappointed.
But not because
you didn't find it.
But because you did.
And you lied.
Nebula.
Don't do this.
Some time ago,
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.
Please don't do this.
And very nearly succeeded.
So I brought her here.
To talk.
Stop. Stop it.
I swear to you on my life.
I never found the Soul Stone.
Accessing memory files.
You know
what he's about to do.
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.
- All of them.
- He can never get them all.
He will!
He can't, Nebula.
Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...
and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.
You're strong.
Me.
You're generous.
Me.
But I never taught you to lie.
That's why
you're so bad at it.
Where is the Soul Stone?
Vormir!
The stone is on Vormir.
Show me.
I am Groot.
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking.
What's there to see?
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.
I am Groot.
Tree, pour what's in the cup
out into space
and go in the cup again.
You speak Groot?
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.
I am Groot.
You'll know when we're close.
Nidavellir's forge harnesses
the blazing power
of a neutron star.
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.
It's truly awesome.
Okay, time to be the captain.
So, dead brother, huh?
Yeah, that could be annoying.
Well, he's been dead before.
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.
And you said
your sister and your dad?
Both dead.
But still got a mom, though?
Killed by a dark elf.
A best friend?
Stabbed through the heart.
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?
Absolutely.
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...
they're all
tremendous motivators.
They really clear the mind.
So I'm good to go.
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...
he's the toughest there is.
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.
He's never fought me twice.
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.
It better be some hammer.
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,
but none succeeded.
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.
Fate wills it so.
Mmm-hmm.
And what if you're wrong?
If I'm wrong, then...
what more could I lose?
I could lose a lot.
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.
Okay.
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?
- What's it look like?
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.
He gave you his eye?
No, he gave me 100 credits.
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.
Thank you, sweet rabbit.
Hmm.
Huh?
Oh.
I would've washed that.
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...
Hey, we're here!
I don't think
this thing works.
Everything seems dark.
It ain't the eye.
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.
And the rings are frozen.
I hope
these dwarves are better
at forging
than they are cleaning.
Maybe they realized
that they live
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?
Yes, why?
It look
anything like that?
I am Groot.
Go back to the pod.
Eitri, wait!
Stop!
Stop.
Thor?
What happened here?
You were supposed
to protect us.
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.
Asgard is destroyed.
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.
I made what he wanted.
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.
Then he killed
everyone anyway.
All except me.
"Your life is yours," he said.
"But your hands
are mine alone."
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.
Every weapon
you've ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword...
it's all inside your head.
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.
Mantis, listen very carefully.
I need you
to meet me on Titan.
Hey, what's going on?
I think we're here.
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.
Close those around it.
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.
We might wanna turn.
Turn! Turn! Turn!
You all right?
That was close.
I owe you one.
Let me just say, if aliens
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.
I do not want another
single pop culture reference
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.
Thanos!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!
Stay down, clown.
Die, blanket of death!
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.
Where is Gamora?
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!
Do it, Quill! I can take it.
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.
I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.
Starting with you.
Wait, what, Thanos?
All right, let me ask you
this one time.
What master do you serve?
What master do I serve?
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?
You're from Earth.
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.
Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?
So you're not
with Thanos?
With Thanos?
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.
You're the ones
Thor told us about.
You know Thor?
Yeah.
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.
Where is he now?
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?
It's a mold.
A king's weapon.
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.
Did it have a name?
Stormbreaker.
That's a bit much.
So how do we make it?
You'll have to restart
the forge.
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.
Rabbit, fire up the pod.
The hell happened
to this planet?
It's eight degrees
off its axis.
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.
Or at least
the beginnings of one.
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,
pin him down,
get what we need.
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.
We just want the gauntlet.
Are you yawning?
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?
Did you hear what I said?
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?
Kick names, take ass.
Yeah, that's right.
All right, just get over here,
please.
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.
We gotta coalesce.
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...
and that way
it might be really good.
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.
Like in Footloose, the movie?
Exactly like Footloose.
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?
It never was.
Don't encourage this,
all right?
- Okay.
- We're getting no help
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?
By the way,
that's a compliment.
Don't forget, I'm half human.
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...
that's 100% you.
Your math
is blowing my mind.
Excuse me.
But does your friend
often do that?
Strange, we all right?
You're back. You're all right.
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.
To see all
the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.
How many did you see?
14,000,605.
How many did we win?
One.
The stone
had better be up there.
For your sister's sake.
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
You know us?
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.
Where is the Soul Stone?
You should know...
it extracts a terrible price.
I am prepared.
We all think that at first.
We are all wrong.
How is it you know
this place so well?
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out,
banished me here.
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.
What you seek
lies in front of you.
As does what you fear.
What's this?
The price.
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.
Tell me what it needs.
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...
understands its power...
the stone demands a sacrifice.
Of what?
In order to take the stone,
you must lose
that which you love.
A soul...
for a soul.
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...
a moment...
when you got
what you deserved.
And I was always
so disappointed.
But now...
You kill and torture...
and you call it mercy.
The universe has judged you.
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.
You failed.
And do you wanna know why?
Because you love nothing.
No one.
No.
Really?
Tears?
They're not for him.
No.
This isn't love.
I ignored my destiny once.
I cannot do that again.
Even for you.
I'm sorry, little one.
No!
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.
I hope you're right
about this.
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda
to the rest of the world...
this is not what I imagined.
And what did you imagine?
The Olympics.
Maybe even a Starbucks.
Should we bow?
Yeah, he's a king.
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.
What are you doing?
Uh, we don't do that here.
So how big of an assault
should we expect?
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.
How we looking?
You will have my Kingsguard,
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.
How you been, Buck?
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.
Whoa.
The structure is polymorphic.
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.
Why didn't you just reprogram
the synapses
to work collectively?
Because we didn't think of it.
I'm sure you did your best.
Can you do it?
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.
It will take time, brother.
How long?
As long as you can give me.
Something's entered
the atmosphere.
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.
God, I love this place.
Yeah, don't
start celebrating yet, guys.
We got more incoming
outside the dome.
It's too late.
We need to destroy
the stone now.
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.
We will hold them off.
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...
you blow it to hell.
I will.
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.
And get this man a shield.
I don't think
you get the scientifics here.
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...
you're gonna need something
a lot bigger
to yank 'em loose.
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...
Fire the engines!
More power, rabbit!
Well done, boy.
That's Nidavellir.
Damn it.
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?
The mechanism
is crippled.
- What?
- With the iris closed,
I can't heat the metal.
How long will it take
to heat it?
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?
I'm gonna hold it open.
That's suicide.
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.
How we looking, Bruce?
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.
Wow! This is amazing, man.
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through
the tree line.
Thank you
for standing with us.
Where's your other friend?
You will pay for his life
with yours.
Thanos will have that stone.
That's not gonna happen.
You are in Wakanda now.
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.
We have blood to spare.
They surrender?
Not exactly.
What the hell?
Looks like we pissed her off.
They're killing themselves.
You see the teeth
on those things?
All right, back up, Sam.
You're gonna get
your wings singed.
Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter
and get in behind us...
there's nothing
between them and Vision.
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.
How do we do that?
We open the barrier.
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.
Requesting
confirmation, My King.
You said open the barrier?
On my signal.
This will be
the end of Wakanda.
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.
Wakanda forever!
Now!
How much longer, Shuri?
I've barely begun, brother.
You might want to pick up
the pace.
Allfathers, give me strength.
You understand, boy?
You're about to take
the full force of a star.
It'll kill you.
Only if I die.
Yes.
That's what killing you means.
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!
Thor! Say something. Come on.
Thor, you okay?
I think he's dying.
He needs the axe!
Where's the handle?
Tree, help me find the handle!
There's too many of 'em!
You guys
are so screwed now!
Bring me Thanos!
Oh, yeah.
You're much more of a Thanos.
I take it the Maw is dead.
This day
extracts a heavy toll.
Still, he accomplished
his mission.
You may regret that.
He brought you face-to-face
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.
And where do you think
he brought you?
Let me guess. Your home?
It was.
And it was beautiful.
Titan was like most planets.
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.
Genocide.
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.
They called me a madman.
And what I predicted
came to pass.
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.
I'm a survivor.
Who wants to murder trillions.
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.
And then what?
I'd finally rest...
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.
Our?
Piece of cake, Quill.
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.
Boom!
Don't let him close his fist.
Magic.
More magic.
Magic with a kick.
Magic with a...
Insect!
Well, well.
You should've killed me.
It would've been
a waste of parts!
Where's Gamora?
Is he under?
Don't let up.
Be quick. He is very strong.
Parker, help! Get over here.
She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.
For the record,
this was my plan.
You're not so strong now, huh?
Where is Gamora?
My Gamora.
No, bullshit!
Where is she?
He is in anguish.
Good.
He... He mourns.
What does
this monster have to mourn?
Gamora.
What?
He took her to Vormir.
He came back
with the Soul Stone.
But she didn't.
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!
Tell me she's lying.
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!
I had to.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!
Oh, God.
Come and get some,
space dogs!
Come on! Get some! Get some!
Come on! Get some!
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.
Okay. How much for the arm?
Oh, I'll get that arm.
New haircut?
Noticed you've copied
my beard.
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.
I am Groot.
I am Steve Rogers.
Fall back! Fall back, now!
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.
I'm doing it.
Why was she up there
all this time?
She's on the field. Take it.
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.
Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him!
- On my way.
He'll die alone. As will you.
She's not alone.
Oh, no, you don't.
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.
What? No! No!
Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!
Hulk? Hulk,
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.
Hulk! Hulk!
Hulk!
No!
Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!
I'll do it myself!
Come on! Yeah!
See ya!
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.
I thought you were formidable,
machine.
But you're dying,
like any man.
Get outta here!
Go!
That was really gross.
I thought I told you to go.
We don't trade lives, Captain.
I got you. I got you.
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.
You're full of tricks, wizard.
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.
A fake.
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.
Stark.
You know me?
I do.
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.
My only curse is you.
Come on!
All that for a drop of blood.
You have my respect, Stark.
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.
I hope they remember you.
Stop.
Spare his life...
and I will give you the stone.
No tricks.
Don't.
One to go.
Where is he?
Did we just lose?
Why would you do that?
We're in the endgame now.
Are you okay?
What? What is it?
He's here.
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.
What the hell?
Cap.
That's him.
Eyes up. Stay sharp.
Wanda.
It's time.
No.
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.
Look at me.
You have the power
to destroy the stone.
Don't.
You must do it. Wanda, please.
We are out of time.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can.
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.
It's not fair.
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.
It's all right.
You could never hurt me.
I just feel you.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I love you.
I understand, my child.
Better than anyone.
You could never.
Today, I lost more
than you can know.
But now is no time to mourn.
Now is no time at all.
No!
I told you...
you'd die for that.
You should have...
You should...
You should have
gone for the head.
No!
Daughter?
Did you do it?
Yes.
What did it cost?
Everything.
What did you do?
What'd you do?
Where'd he go?
Thor.
Where'd he go?
Steve?
Up, General. Up!
This is no place to die.
I am Groot.
Oh...
No, no, no!
Groot! No.
Sam!
Sam, where you at?
Something's happening.
Quill?
Steady, Quill.
Oh, man.
Tony.
There was no other way.
Mr. Stark?
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.
I don't know...
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.
I'm sorry.
He did it.
What is this?
What the hell is happening?
Oh, God.
Still no word
from Stark?
No, not yet.
We're watching every satellite
on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.
What is it?
Multiple bogeys
over Wakanda.
Same energy signature
as New York?
Ten times bigger.
Tell Klein
we'll meet him at...
Nick! Nick!
They okay?
There's no one here.
Call Control.
Code red.
Nick.
Hill.
Oh, no.
Mother...
BOY: Baba...
MAN: Yes, my son.
BOY: Tell me a story.
MAN: (CHUCKLES) Which one?
The story of home.
Millions of years ago...
a meteorite
made of vibranium...
the strongest substance
in the universe...
struck the continent
of Africa...
affecting the plant life
around it.
And when
the time of man came...
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...
until a warrior shaman...
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...
a plant that granted him
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.
The warrior became king...
and the first Black Panther...
the protector of Wakanda.
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...
more advanced
than any other nation.
But as Wakanda thrived...
the world around it descended
further into chaos.
To keep vibranium safe...
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...
keeping the truth
of their power
from the outside world.
And we still hide, Baba?
Yes.
BOY: Why?
(IN THE TRUNK
BY TOO $HORT PLAYING)
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!
Whatever!
Get outta here!
Check up.
Pick your man up! He open.
Where you at?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Pass! Pass!
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!
Watch me get this.
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.
KID: Come on.
BOY: What you got?
You ain't got nothing.
MAN: Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,
won't be no worries.
You in the van,
come in through from the west.
Come around the corner.
- Land right here.
- Mmm-hmm.
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...
(FAINT RUSTLING)
Hide the straps.
Yo, is it the Feds?
No.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.
They're holding spears.
Open it.
JAMES: You serious?
They won't knock again.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Prove to me you are one of us.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
My King.
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.
As you wish.
At ease.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Come, baby brother.
how you are holding up.
You look strong.
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.
How is home?
Not so good.
(IN XHOSA) Baby brother.
There has been an attack.
This man...
Ulysses Klaue...
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.
Many lives were lost.
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...
and how to strike.
He had someone on the inside.
Why are you here?
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.
I did no such thing.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Tell him who you are.
Zuri, son of Badu...
What?
James. James, you lied to me?
Leave him.
You were Wakandan
this whole time?
You betrayed Wakanda!
How could you lie
to me like...
Stand down.
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?
Prince N'Jobu...
you will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
Check up!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Guard your man,
guard your man!
Yo.
REPORTER:
The tiny nation of Wakanda
is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.
The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...
after a terrorist attack
at the United Nations
a week ago.
The suspect
has since been apprehended.
Though it remains one of
the poorest countries
in the world...
fortified by
mountain ranges...
and an impenetrable
rainforest...
Wakanda does not engage
in international trade
or accept aid.
The succession
of the throne...
is expected to fall
to the oldest
of the king's two children...
Prince T'Challa.
OKOYE: My Prince...
coming up on them now.
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.
Hmm.
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.
Just don't freeze
when you see her.
What are you talking about?
I never freeze.
(MEN GRUNTING)
MILITANT 1: What's going on?
MILITANT 2: It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.
The car no start.
MILITANT 3: What happened?
MILITANT 4: The engine failed.
MILITANT 1: Ours, too.
What is it, Captain?
- Defense positions.
- (GUNS COCKING)
Defense positions.
MILITANT 2:
Are we under attack?
Defense positions.
Get around to the side.
Defense positions.
Hey. Defense positions!
No games.
(BARKING)
What do you see?
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
- Come in. Come in.
- (SCREAMS)
Over there! Look back!
Watch out!
(ALL SCREAMING AND GRUNTING)
NAKIA: T'Challa, no!
This one's just a boy.
He got kidnapped as well.
BLACK PANTHER: Nakia...
I...
- I wanted...
- MILITANT 1: Hey!
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!
I will shoot her right now.
(GROANS)
You froze.
BLACK PANTHER: Ah...
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.
My father is dead, Nakia.
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.
And I wish for you
to be there.
NAKIA:
Carry yourselves home now.
WOMAN: Thank you.
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.
Thank you oh.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
You will speak
nothing of this day.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL
PLAYING)
OKOYE: Sister Nakia...
My Prince...
we are home.
This never gets old.
(WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL
PLAYING)
Queen Mother...
Princess...
My comfort for your loss.
RAMONDA: Thank you, Nakia.
It is so good
to have you back with us.
Take her to
the River Province
to prepare her
for the ceremony.
Yes, General.
Did he freeze?
Like an antelope
in headlights.
(LAUGHING)
Are you finished?
So surprised
my little sister came
to see me off
before our big day.
You wish!
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.
How many times
do I have to teach you?
Just because something works
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.
You are teaching me?
What do you know?
SHURI: More than you.
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...
to your ceremonial outfit.
Shuri!
Sorry, Mother!
How are you
feeling today, Mama?
Proud.
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.
He is with us...
and it is your time
to be king.
Good morning.
How can I help you?
I was just checking out
these artifacts.
They tell me
you're the expert.
Ah. You could say that.
They're beautiful.
Where's this one from?
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...
present day Ghana...
19th century.
For real?
What about this one?
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...
16th century.
Now, tell me about this one.
Also from Benin,
seventh century.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Fula tribe, I believe.
Nah.
I beg your pardon?
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin
but it's from Wakanda.
And it's made
out of vibranium.
(CHUCKLES) Don't trip.
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.
These items aren't for sale.
How do you think
your ancestors got these?
You think they paid
a fair price?
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?
Sir, I'm going to have to
(CLEARS THROAT)
ask you to leave.
You got
all this security in here
watching me
ever since I walked in.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- But you ain't checking for
- what you put in your body.
- (GASPS)
All right, mate.
Let's have it.
- Come on, mate. Time.
- (GRUNTS)
I think she might not
be feeling too good.
Somebody get some help!
Come here!
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!
GUARD: Medical emergency
right away
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.
Look out.
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.
I'm gonna take a break.
MEDIC 1: Let's give the lady
some space, please.
MEDIC 2: Step back,
please, gents.
Step back, please.
(GUARDS GRUNT)
Hey, come here.
Come here. It's okay.
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?
Because it's better to leave
the crime scene
more spread out.
Makes us look like amateurs.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Now then,
let's see if you know
what you're talking about.
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
That's just a taste.
(SNIFFING)
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.
(CHUCKLES) It's already sold!
Whatever you try,
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.
That'll make my day.
I can kill two birds
with one stone.
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

(CHANTING CONTINUES)
M'Baku, what are you

It's challenge day.
We have watched...
and listened
from the mountains!
We have watched
with disgust...
as your
technological advancements
have been overseen by a child!
Who scoffs at tradition!
And now you want to
hand the nation
over to this prince...
who could not keep
his own father safe.
Mmm?
We will not have it.
I said,
we will not have it, oh!

I would rather die!

Come here to your son.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Praise the ancestors.
(SOFT GROWLING)
(LAUGHING)
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Father.
My son.
T'CHAKA: Stand up.
You are a king.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
What is wrong my son?
I am not ready.
Have you not prepared
to be king your whole life?
Have you not trained
and studied,
been by my side?
what I am talking about.
I am not ready
to be without you.
A man who has not prepared
his children
for his own death...
has failed as a father.
Have I ever failed you?
Never.
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.
I want to be
a great king, Baba.
Just like you.
You're going to struggle.
So you'll need to
surround yourself
with people you trust.
You're a good man
with a good heart.
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.
(GASPING)
Breathe.
T'Challa, breathe.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Breathe.
He was there.
(CHUCKLES)
He was there. My father.
(BEREBERE BY IDRISSA SOUMAORO
PLAYING)
Just one?
Come home, Nakia.
I'm right here.
Stay.
I came to support you
and to honor your father...
but I can't stay.
I found my calling out there.
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.
I can't be happy here...
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?
Share what we have.
We could provide aid...
and access to technology
and refuge
to those who need it.
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.
If the world found out
what we truly are...
what we possess...
we could lose our way of life.
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others
and protect ourselves
at the same time.
(SIGHS)
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.
- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.
T'CHALLA: Is that him?
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?
W'KABI: Of course.
I see Nakia is back.
You guys going to work it out?
T'Challa...
what's wrong?
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.
More, like what?
Foreign aid, refugee programs.
You let the refugees in...
they bring their problems
with them.
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...
to go out there
and clean up the world,
then I'll be all for it.
But waging war
on other countries
has never been our way.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILLING)
You, too, huh?
Bast! We're in trouble.
My King.
My love.
You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...
in South Korea...
tomorrow night.
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.
We need a king.
My parents were killed
when he attacked.
Not a day goes by
when I do not think
about what Klaue took from us.
From me.
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.
W'KABI: Take me with you.
We'll take him down together,
side by side.
I need you here
protecting the border.
Then I ask...
you kill him
where he stands...
or you bring him back to us.
You have my word.
I will bring him back.
We will proceed
with the mission.
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
My King!
- Stop it. Stop it.
- (CHUCKLES)
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?
Okoye.
And Nakia as well.
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?
Yes.
We'll be fine.
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.
Yes!
I have great things
to show you, Brother.
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.
Unlimited range,
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.
Check these out.
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.
T'CHALLA: Ah.
And what are these?
The real question is
(SHOUTS) what are those?
(CHUCKLES)
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.
I bet the Elders loved that.
(CHUCKLES)
Try them on.
Fully automated.
Like the old American movie
Baba used to watch.
T'CHALLA: Mmm.
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.
Interesting.
Guess what I call them.
Sneakers.
Because you...
Never mind.
If you're going to take
on Klaue...
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.
Exhibit A.
T'CHALLA: My design.
SHURI: Old tech.
- Old?
- Functional, but old.
"Hey, people are shooting
at me.
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."
- Enough.
- (CHUCKLES)
Now, look at these.
Do you like that one?
Tempting.
But the idea
is to not be noticed.
This one.
(TRILLING)
Now tell it to go on.
SHURI: Ooh!
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.
Strike it.
- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not that hard, genius!
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.
I invite you to my lab,
and you just
kick things around?
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.
Hey.
Wait a minute.
SHURI: The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...
and hold it in place
for redistribution.
Very nice.
Strike it again
in the same spot.
(KIMOYO BEADS BEEP)
You're recording?
For research purposes.
(SHURI LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
Delete that footage.
(HANGOVER BY PSY
AND SNOOP DOGG PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
This way.
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.
What? It's a disgrace.
(IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia.
Good to see you.
Who are these two?
My friends from Kenya.
Very deep pockets.
They're good.
Good for trouble...
...like you?
(EXCLAIMS)
Thank you!
(PRAY FOR ME BY THE WEEKND
AND KENDRICK LAMAR PLAYING)
Spread out.
The buyer
is likely already here.
The woman outside.
What trouble
was she referring to?
Ah... I got into
a disagreement
with some ivory traders.
- Made a bit of a mess.
- Hmm.
And will there be
any trouble tonight,
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?
Depends...
on how quickly we finish
the mission.
OKOYE: (ON RADIO)
Can we please focus?
Thank you.
(SPEAKING KOREAN)
Over here.
One whiskey, please.
Eyes up. Americans.
I count three.
OKOYE: Five.
How could you miss
Greased Lightning
there behind you?
Six.
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.
It just got
a little more complicated.
Agent Ross.
Your Highness.
You are buying from Klaue.
What I'm doing or not doing...
on behalf of
the U.S. government
is none of your concern.
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.
I gave you Zemo.
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...
that the king of
a third world country
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?
I'd say we were even.
You really need to leave, now.
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.
You've been warned.
CROUPIER: Three, craps.
Hey, you won!
You know what?
I think
I'll just take these...
bring them over here
- and hold on for safekeeping.
- ROSS: Mmm-hmm.
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.
He cannot leave with Klaue.
All right.
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia
links back to a person...
that I'm not actually saying
I'm here to make
a deal with...
but that deal
will not be called off.
When the dust settles,
you and me can work
something out.
I'm not here to make a deal.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING
ON CAR STEREO)
(DOOR BUZZING AND BEEPING)
Klaue, plus eight!
General.
In position
to secure our exit.
And the vibranium?
I don't see it yet.
OKOYE: I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.
There's not supposed to be.
Somebody did not get the memo.
Definitely armed.
Well, that is quite
the entourage.
You got a mixtape coming out?
Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Yeah, actually, there is one.
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.
(CHUCKLES)
You think they're for you?
Don't worry.
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,
thank you very much.
OKOYE: Six more. It's a setup.
You got the diamonds?
Okay. That's enough.
- We need to move on Klaue.
- T'CHALLA: Stand down.
We can't afford a shootout.
Vibranium?
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.
It's now or never.
(IN XHOSA) Stand down!
Hey!
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
(GRUNTING)
(CROWD SCREAMING)

That was awesome!
That was awesome!
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!
- Do we just leave him?
- He'll catch up.
(DEVICE BEEPS)
Shuri!
Yes!
AUTOMATED VOICE: Remote
driving system activated.
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?
T'CHALLA: For Bast's sake!
- Just drive!
- Okay, calm down!
Whoo! Let's go!
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?
(UPBEAT RAP MUSIC PLAYING
ON STEREO)
Which one is he in now?
Hey, split up!
- They're trying to lose us.
- I'll take the right.
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.
(TIRES SCREECH)
We're not going to make it!
BLACK PANTHER: Keep going!
Whoo! Brother!
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTS)
Hey, what was that?
BLACK PANTHER: Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.
Guns.
So primitive!
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!
The bullets won't penetrate!
What are you doing?
Just drive.
(MEN YELL)
- Whoo!
- Shit!
Hey, look at your suit.
You've been taking bullets,
charging it up
with kinetic energy.
BLACK PANTHER:
Pull around the truck.
Where'd he go?
You show-off.
There he is!
Hold tight!
(ENGINE REVS)
All right.
Let's have some fun!
(GRUNTING)
(STRAINING)
(PANTING)
Hop in.
Put that spear in the trunk.
BLACK PANTHER: Faster, Shuri.
I'm going as fast as I can!
Take a right! Take a right!
(TIRES SCREECH)
No, no, no!
(GRUNTS) Brother!
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING)
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
(GROANING AND PANTING)
BLACK PANTHER: Klaue!
Did you think we would forget?
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING)
Look at me, murderer!
Where did you get this weapon?
You savages didn't deserve it.
- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.
(IN XHOSA) King!
The world watches.
Let's go, huh?
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)
Yeah.
KLAUE: Hello.
(GIGGLES)
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.
(CACKLING)
(AIR KISSES)
(SPLUTTERING)
So this is a big mess, huh?
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes
than to make a scene here.
After your questioning,
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor
by letting you
even be in here.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
If he touches you again,
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.
Does she speak English?
When she wants to.
Huh.
I'm going in.
When I'm done,
you guys are up.
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.
You see that?
It's called diplomacy.
You're welcome.
(KLAUE SINGS WHAT IS LOVE
BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN
AND JUNIOR TORELLO)
- Okoye.
- (SCOFFS)
Play nice.
Americans.
(KLAUE CONTINUES SINGING)
(ROSS CLEARS THROAT)
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.
I'm much more your speed.
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.
Where'd you get that?
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.
But I can get you one,
if you like.
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,
and I'll ask them.
He's right outside.
Why don't you
ask him yourself?
What? T'Challa?
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?
Bingo.
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?
ROSS: Um...
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.
KLAUE: (ON EARPIECE)
It's all a front.
Explorers searched for it
for centuries.
El Dorado, the Golden City.
They thought they could
find it in South America...
but it was in Africa
the whole time.
A technological marvel.
All because it was built
on a mound
of the most valuable metal
known to man.
Isipho, they call it.
The gift.
Vibranium.
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.
It's not just a metal.
They sew it
into their clothes.
It powers their city,
their tech...
their weapons.
Weapons?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.
That's a nice fairy tale,
but Wakanda is
a third world country...
and you stole
all their vibranium.
(LAUGHING) I stole...
All of it?
I took a tiny piece of it.
They have
a mountain full of it.
They've been mining it
for thousands of years...
and they still haven't
scratched the surface.
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it
and got out of there alive.
If you don't believe me,
you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.
What his claws are made of.
(BEEPING)
Your father told the UN...
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.
But now he's telling me
you have more.
And you believe the word
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?
(TRUCK BEEPING)
(IN KOREAN) Where is that?
Back there.
How much more are you hiding?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Something is happening
out back.
(YELLS)
Get down!
- (KLAUE YELLING)
- Stand down!
MAN 1: Cover!
MAN 2: Grenade!
I see you took your time,
didn't you? (LAUGHS)
(OKOYE SPEAKING XHOSA)
My King!
My King.
Nakia.
He just jumped in front of me.
(LABORED BREATHING
AND GRUNTING)
I don't think
he'll make it here.
It hit his spine.
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)
This will stabilize him
for now.
(ROSS GRUNTING SOFTLY)
(EXHALING DEEPLY)
Give him to us.
We can save him.
OKOYE: Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.
We failed.
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?
He took a bullet for me.
OKOYE: That was his choice.
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?
Let us consider
that we heal him.
It is his duty to report back
to his country.
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.
I cannot just let him die...
knowing we can save him.
Where exactly
are we taking him?
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.
This is going to be fun.
He will live.
- (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
- (MUSIC STOPS)
W'Kabi is here.
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?
He's not here.
(SIGHS)
He slipped through our hands.
"Slipped"?
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.
With you,
I thought it'd be different.
But it's more of the same.
Let's get going, boss.
You always sell to the CIA?
I sell to the highest bidder.
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...
and I lay low for a bit,
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.
I know you good for it.
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.
You don't want to
go there, boy.
Yeah, I do.
KLAUE: Drop it!
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine
ends today.
Put your gun down now!
I'm sorry.
- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.
(KLAUE GROANS)
(GROANS)
(KLAUE PANTING)
You really want to go
to Wakanda?
They're savages.
This is what they do
to people like us.
KILLMONGER: I ain't worried
about no brand.
Check these out.
Each one is for a kill.
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.
(CHUCKLING)
T'CHALLA: Leave us!
So your mission did not go
as planned.
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?
My father told me
he disappeared.
There was a man today...
wearing a ring
identical to this one.
That is not possible.
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!
My grandfather's ring!
Do not tell me
what is possible.
Tell me the truth!
Some truths...
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.
That is not your choice
to make.
What happened to him?
I promised the king
to say nothing.
I am your king now!
Your uncle took...
a War Dog assignment
in America.
Your father...
placed me there...
to observe...
unbeknownst to him.
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.
They had a child.
The hardships he saw there...
radicalized your uncle.
I observed
for as long as I could.
Their leaders
have been assassinated.
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.
All over the planet...
our people suffer because
they don't have the tools
to fight back.
With vibranium weapons,
they could overthrow
every country...
and Wakanda could
rule them all
the right way.
He knew your father
would not support this.
So, your uncle betrayed us.
No!
He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.
No, no, no.
You will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
ZURI: He drew his weapon
on me.
- No!
- (GRUNTING)
ZURI: Your father
killed his own brother...
to save my life.
Speak nothing of this.
And the child?
We left him.
We had to...
maintain...
the lie.
What is this?
Just a little gift.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
(GRUNTING)
All right, where am I?
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!
(STAMMERS) What?
My name is Everett.
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...
former air force pilot
and now CIA.
Right.
Okay, is this Wakanda?
No, it's Kansas.
How long ago was Korea?
SHURI: Yesterday.
I don't think so.
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
They do here.
But not by magic,
by technology.
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.
ROSS: These train things...
that's magnetic levitation,
right?
Obviously.
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.
The light panels,
what are they?
- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?
In its raw form...
vibranium is too dangerous
to be transported
at that speed...
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.
ROSS: There's vibranium
on those trains?
There's vibranium
all around us.
That's how I healed you.
(CHUCKLES)
Where is T'Challa?
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.
A man showed up at the border
who claims
to have killed Klaue.
What?
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.
We need to find your brother!
An outsider?
No, a Wakandan.
He's not a Wakandan.
He's one of ours.
He killed his own brother...
and left a child behind...
with nothing.
What kind of king...
What kind of man does that?
No man is perfect.
Not even your father.
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...
he may have created something
even worse.
Hey.
Look at me.
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
Brother, you need to
get here now!
ROSS: Erik Stevens.
Graduated Annapolis age 19...
MIT for grad school.
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,
like it was a video game.
Started calling him
Killmonger.
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.
They will drop off the grid...
so they can
commit assassinations
and take down governments.
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?
SHURI: He has
a War Dog tattoo...
but we have no record of him.
Is this man Wakandan or not?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Tell us what is going on.
Speak.
I'm standing in your house...
serving justice to a man
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand
is because I know who you are.
Now, what do you want?
I want the throne.
(LAUGHS AND SPEAKS XHOSA)
My goodness.
(TRIBES' ELDERS LAUGHING)
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.
Must feel good.
It's about two billion people
all over the world
that looks like us.
But their lives
are a lot harder.
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.
And what tools are those?
Vibranium. Your weapons.
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...
for people
who are not our own.
Not your own?
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?
So ain't all people
your people?
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.
And it is my responsibility
to make sure
our people are safe...
and that vibranium
does not fall
into the hands
of a person like you.
KILLMONGER: Mmm...
RAMONDA: Son.
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.
Reject his request.
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.
An American black operative.
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.
That's not my name, Princess.
Ask me, King.
No.
Ask me.
Take him away.
(IN XHOSA) Who are you?
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.
Son of N'Jobu?
with Panther claws
in his chest!
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.
(IN XHOSA) You're lying!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.
RIVER TRIBE ELDER:
(GASPS) What?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
The descendent of N'Jobu.
I'm exercising my blood right
to challenge
for the mantles of king...
and Black Panther.
Do not do this, T'Challa.
BORDER TRIBE ELDER:
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,
he is within his rights.
He has no rights here!
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.
Weeks? I don't need weeks.
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?
I accept your challenge.
SHURI:
He'll never beat T'Challa.
He should've just come
to the first challenge
and gotten it over with.
(UPBEAT DRUMMING)
ZURI: The king
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther
stripped away.
(LABORED BREATHING)
Where is Agent Ross?
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.
This is your last chance.
Throw down your weapons,
and we can handle this
another way.
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.
I trained, I lied, I killed...
just to get here.
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...
Iraq.
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters
right here on this continent.
And all this death...
just so I could kill you.
Let the challenge begin.
- (FAST-TEMPO DRUMMING)
- (GRUNTING)
Yield!
(GROANS)
(T'CHALLA GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
Snap out of it, T'Challa!
(GRUNTING AND GROANING)
(YELLS)
(GASPS)
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
Come on, get up.
Come here.
This is for my father.
ZURI: Erik!
- Zuri, no.
- Stop!
- Zuri!
- Zuri, don't!
I am the cause of
your father's death.
Not him.
Take me.
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.
No!
No! No!
Zuri, no!
(GROANS)
No!
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!
No! No!
(YELLING)
Is this your king? Huh?
(T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
Is this your king?
The Black Panther,
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?
Come on, Brother!
Is there nothing
that can be done?
- (T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
- Him?
He's supposed to protect you?
- No.
- No!
No!
Nah. I'm your king.
- No! No!
- We have to go now!
Queen Mother, let's go!
(RAMONDA CRYING)
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?
- Yes.
- (SIGHS)
(IN XHOSA) Thank you.
to them immediately.
(IN XHOSA) I cannot.
Though my heart is with you.
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man
who showed up here
only hours ago.
He is of royal blood.
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.
Does that really matter?
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.
Overthrow?
Nakia!
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.
What are you loyal to?
I loved him.
I loved my country, too.
Then you serve your country.
No. I save my country.
What's wrong?
The king is dead.
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.
First Baba.
And now my brother.
(CRYING) Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.
(RAMONDA SIGHS)
- (WHISPERS) It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.
Where's Okoye?
Okoye is not coming.
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.
Wait here.
What has happened
to our Wakanda?
(CHANTING SOFTLY)
SHAMAN:
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.
(SOBBING QUIETLY)
N'JOBU: What did I tell you
about going into my things?
Hmm?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
What did you find?
Your home.
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.
Yes. The sunsets there
are the most beautiful
in the world.
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.
Why?
They will say you are lost.
But I'm right here.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
No tears for me?
Everybody dies.
It's just life around here.
Well, look at what
I have done.
I should've taken you back
long ago.
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.
That's why they can't find us.
(GASPING)
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?
This all of it?
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,
we will be ready.
Another king?
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...
(CHOKING)
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.
(YELPS)
(BOTH GASP)
Burn it all!
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
You know, where I'm from...
when black folks
started revolutions,
they never had
the firepower...
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.
Where was Wakanda?
Hmm?
Yeah, all that ends today.
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.
Already in place.
I know how colonizers think.
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.
And their children.
And anyone else
who takes their side.
It's time they know
the truth about us!
We're warriors!
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.
OKOYE: Wakanda has survived
for so long...
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.
But the world is changing,
General.
Elders, it is getting smaller.
The outside world
is catching up...
and soon it will be
the conquerors
or the conquered.
I'd rather be the former.
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.
ROSS: So where are we
going again?
NAKIA: We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb
to Jabariland.
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.
Nakia.
I don't like this.
The Herb belongs to us.
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.
I am a spy with no army.
I wouldn't stand a chance.
(SIGHS)
We'll go.
Oh, boy.
(SHUSHES)
(MEN CHANTING AND GRUNTING)
ROSS: Oh, shit.
Look down. Stay calm.
Shuri.
Look down.
My son...
was murdered in ritual combat.
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...
(GRUNTS)
- The new king...
- (MEN GRUNTING)
M'BAKU: You cannot talk!
One more word,
and I will feed you
to my children.
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.
(LAUGHING)
NAKIA: Great Gorilla M'Baku...
this is why we are here.
To offer this to you.
An outsider
sits on our throne.
Only you can help us stop him.
Come with me.
- (GASPS)
- Impossible!
(RAMONDA GASPING)
Is he breathing?
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.
One of our fishermen found him
at the edge
of the river border.
He brought him to me.
Why do you have him
in the snow?
It is the only thing
keeping him
from joining the ancestors.
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.
Nakia, the Herb.
I call upon the ancestors.
I call upon Bast.
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.
Heal him.
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!
Okay.
(IN XHOSA)
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Wake up, T'Challa.
Wake up.
(T'CHAKA SPEAKS XHOSA)
My son.
for you to come home...
and be reunited with me.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Why?
bring the boy home?
Why, Baba?
He...
He was the truth
I chose to omit.
You were wrong to abandon him.
I chose my people.
I chose Wakanda.
Our future depended...
You were wrong!
All of you were wrong!
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!
We let the fear
of our discovery
stop us from doing
what is right!
No more!
I cannot stay here with you.
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.
He is a monster
of our own making.
I must take the mantle back.
I must!
I must right these wrongs.
- (T'CHALLA GASPS)
- (RAMONDA EXCLAIMING)
(SHIVERING)
Do you have a blanket?
NAKIA: Killmonger
has the full support
of our military.
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.
ROSS: Of course he did.
That's what he was
trained to do.
His unit used to work
with the CIA
to destabilize
foreign countries.
They would always strike
at transitions of power...
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.
You get control of government,
the military...
- Our resources.
- ROSS: Right.
The Great Mound.
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.
He will send our weapons
all over the world.
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.
- What?
- What about you?
The challenge
will have to continue.
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.
It is my duty
to keep you safe.
If he gets control
of our technology,
nowhere will be safe.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
The Black Panther lives.
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...
I will be right there
beside him.
As will I.
ROSS: I'm in, too.
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.
(M'BAKU YAWNS LOUDLY)
Are you done?
(STAMMERS) Are you done?
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
I owed you a great debt.
A life for a life.
Consider it paid.
Please allow my mother
to stay here.
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.
You know, I could use
an army as well.
I bet you could. (LAUGHS)
But no.
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.
It is our cause.
- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...
and now you speak of "us"?
I cannot speak for past kings.
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.
We both know the power
of vibranium.
If Killmonger
gains control of it,
who do you think
he will come for next?
We will not help you.
(SIGHS)
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
W'KABI:
Everything is on schedule.
Have the spies been alerted?
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.
But the War Dogs in London,
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.
We'll strike there first.
The others'll come around.
Look at this.
A handheld sonic cannon,
powerful enough
to stop a tank...
untraceable by
metal detectors.
And we got thousands of them.
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.
(EXPLOSION)
He lives.
N'Jadaka!
Wassup?
I never yielded!
And as you can see,
I am not dead!
All that challenge shit
is over with!
I'm the king now!
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!
- Shuri, now.
- SHURI: (ON RADIO) Copy that.
SHURI: Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

is not complete.
What will we do?

So what do I do?
You'll have to fly it.
- What?
- You were a great pilot.
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.
It's just like riding
a hoverbike.
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?
Hey, Nakia, take that.
- I'm not a Dora.
- Just put it on, it's armor!
Come!
Good luck, Agent Ross!

Neither will he.

I don't need a suit

Your reign is over!
You sat up here,

see us become
just like the people
you hate so much.
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.
You have become them!
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!
The world took
everything away from me!
Everything I ever loved!
But I'mma make sure

I'mma track down

I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.
And for the first time
in our history...
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...
with the outside world.
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.
We cannot.
We must not.
We will work to be an example
of how we...
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...
should treat each other.
Now, more than ever...
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.
We all know the truth.
More connects us
than separates us.
But in times of crisis...
the wise build bridges...
while the foolish
build barriers.
We must find a way...
to look after one another...
as if we were one,
single tribe.
With all due respect,
King T'Challa...
what can a nation of farmers
have to offer
the rest of the world?
