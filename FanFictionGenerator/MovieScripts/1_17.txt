Who am I? You sure you want to know?
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...
... if somebody told you I was just an
average ordinary guy, not a care in the world...
... somebody lied.
But let me assure you, this
like any story worth telling...
... is all about a girl.
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.
The woman I've loved
since before I even liked girls.
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.
Hey! Stop the bus!
That's me.
Tell him to stop! Please!
Stop!
Hey! Stop the bus!
Stop the bus! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Blvd.
Catch a cab, Parker!
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
What a geek!
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.
Would you date him?
Midtown High seniors.
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.
So behave accordingly.
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.
Come on, stay together.
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.
- Dad would you ask Hoskins to drive around the corner please.
- Why?
The entrance is right there.
Dad these are public school kids,
I'm not showing up for the field trip in a Rolls.
You want me to trade in my care for a Jetta
just because you flunked out of every private school I ever sent you to?
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.
It's just...
Just what, Harry?
Forget it.
Pete!
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Harry! Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks Dad.
- Um, Peter may I introduce my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.
- It's a great honour to meet you sir.
- Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.
Y'know, I'm something of a scientist myself.
I read all your research on nanotechnology.
Really Brilliant.
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.
- I live with my aunt and uncle, they are proud.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.
I think he wants to adopt you.
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.
That's amazing!
This is the most advanced electron
microscope in the eastern seaboard.
It's unreal.
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...
...varying strengths which help them
in their constant search for food.
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.
For the school paper?
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...
...genus Kukulcania.
It spins an intricate funnel shaped web whose strands
have a tensile strength
...proportionately equal to the type of high tension wire...
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?
Or his father will fire your father.
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?
What is going on?
The next person who talks
will fail this course. I kid you not.
- This grass spider...
- Let's go.
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...
...that some researchers believe
it almost borders on precognition.
-Those guys are jerks.
-...an imminent awareness of danger...
A spider-sense.
Hey, look at that spider.
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.
It's a defense mechanism.
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?
Who wouldn't?
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility has...
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.
I love them!
Yeah, me too.
You know, spiders can change
their color...
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.
...transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...
...combining the genetic
information from all three...
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.
There's 14.
I beg your pardon?
- One's missing.
- Yeah.
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the eastern seaboard?
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.
Let's talk about how we listen.
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...
...but at Midtown High...
Hey, Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.
- Sure, yeah.
- Great.
Where do you want me?
Over here?
Yeah, that's great.
Don't make me look ugly.
That's impossible.
Perfect.
- Is that good?
- Great.
That's great.
M.J., let's go!
Wait. Thanks!
Parker, let's do it.
We've solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.
I've already seen the glider.
That's not what I'm here for.
General Slocum, good to see you again.
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors pay us a little visit.
I want to see the progress report on
Human performance enhancers.
We tried vapour inhalation with rodent subjects.
They showed an 800 percent increase in strength.
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?
-In one trial yes.
-It was an aberration.
All the tests since
have been successful.
In the trial that went wrong, what happen?
what were the side effects?
Violence, aggression...
...and insanity.
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.
With the exception of Dr. Strom our entire staff
certifies the product
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.
I'm going to be frank with you.
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.
Norman, the General gave the go-ahead
to request aerospace
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your so-called performance enhancers
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.
Gentlemen. Ladies.
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voil! There is light.
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.
I'm already on my ass, May.
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.
Hand me that dish. The green one.
The corporation is downsizing
the people...
...and upsizing their profits.
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?
Computer...
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.
I love you. And Peter loves you.
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.
How you doing? How was the field trip?
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.
- You won't have a bite?
- No thanks, had a bite.
Did you get some pictures, Peter?
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
What's that all about?
In this recombination lab...
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...
...combining the genetic
information from all three...
... into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.
The data just doesn't justify
this test.
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.
Don't be a coward.
Risks are part of laboratory science.
Let me reschedule,
with the proper medical staff and a volunteer.
- If you just give me two weeks...
- Two weeks?
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.
Oh, that's cold.
Norman?
Norman!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Norman!
Back to formula?
Weird.
- Peter?
- Yeah?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?
Yep. Big change.
- Well, hurry up. You're going to be late.
- Right.
Okay.
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.
- I got better.
- See?
- Bye, guys.
- You haven't eaten anything, have you got your lunch money?
- Yeah I've got it.
Hey Michaelangelo don't forget
we're painting the kitchen right after school. Got it?
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.
And don't start up with me.
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.
You're trash!
You're always going to be trash just like her.
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?
Hi, M.J.
Hey, M.J.
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?
I got the car. Hop in.
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.
Or not.
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!
Tell him to stop.
- Check him out!
- Dork!
Dad!
Dad, are you all right?
Harry.
What are you doing on the floor?
I don't know.
Have you been there all night?
Last night I was...
What?
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.
What?
They found his body this morning
in the lab. He's been murdered, sir.
- What are you talking about?
- And the flight suit and the glider...
- What about it?
- It's been stolen, sir.
Wow! Great reflexes!
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.
You just get contacts?
Well, see you.
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.
Did you see that?
Parker?
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny don't you, freak?
- Flash it was just an accident.
-My fist breaking your teeth is the accident.
-C'mon Flash, stop.
-I don't want to fight you Flash.
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.
Help him, Harry.
How'd he do that?
Which one?
He's all yours, man.
Flash, get up!
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.
That was amazing.
I'm out of here. Come on.
Go, web!
Fly.
Up, up and away, web.
Shazam!
Go! Go!
Go, web, go!
Tallyho.
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?
Bring me some beer.
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!
You're as stupid as your mother.
Where's she going?
Where you going?
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!
- Were you listening to that?
- No.
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.
I guess you can always hear us.
Everybody shouts.
Your aunt and uncle don't.
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...
You really freaked us out.
I'm sorry. Is he okay?
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.
So where are you going
after you graduate?
I wanna move into the city.
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.
Work my way through college.
What about you?
Headed for the city too.
Can't wait to get out of here.
I wanna...
What?
No, come on. Try me.
I wanna...
...act...
...on-stage.
Really?
Oh, that's perfect.
You were awesome
in all the school plays.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.
Peter, that was first grade.
Well...
...even so.
Sometimes...
...you know people.
You can just see what's coming.
What do you see coming for you?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.
And what for me?
For you?
You're gonna light up Broadway.
You know...
...you're taller than you look.
I hunch.
Don't.
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.
Come on.
I gotta go.
Bye.
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.
- Look at it!
- Hop in.
Oh, my God. What a cool car!
Pretty tight, huh?
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.
Cool car.
What's going on in there?
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.
Okay. Thanks.
Something's bothering him.
Maybe he's too embarrased to tell me what it is.
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.
I don't know, I just don't know anymore.
I'm going to the downtown library,
I'll see you later.
- Wait. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- I'll take the train.
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go, go.
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Now wait a minute, we need to talk.
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?
Because we haven't talked at all for so long,
your Aunt May and I don't even know who you are any more.
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.
- You start fights at school.
- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
- Well you sure as hell finished it.
- What was I supposed to do, run away?
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...
But, Pete look, you're changing. I know,
I went through exactly the same thing at your age.
No. Not exactly.
Peter... these are the years
when a man changes...
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.
Just be careful who you change into.
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.
But just because you can
beat him up...
...doesn't give you the right to.
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.
Are you afraid that I'm going to turn into some
kind of criminal? Quit worrying about me, okay?
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing, please.
I don't mean to lecture and I don't mean to
preach. And I know I'm not your father--
Then stop pretending to be!
Right.
I'll pick you up here at 1 0.
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.
For $3000...
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?
Who?
I know who.
The Flying Dutchman!
Next.
There's no featherweight
division here smallfry. Next.
No, no. Sign me up.
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain while participating in said event
and you are indeed participating of your own free will?
- Yes.
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.
Told you! Told you!
Winner!
Next victim!
Are you ready for more?
Bone Saw is ready!
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.
The Human Spider? That's it.
That's the best you got?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
...the terrifying, the deadly...
...the amazing Spiderman!
- My Name's the Human Spider.
- I don't care, get out there.
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.
I hope you brought your mommy.
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my legs!
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Cage! Cage! Cage!
Cage!
Hello? Guys?
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?
Hey listen! This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!
Hey, freak show!
You're going nowhere.
I got you for three minutes.
Three minutes of playtime.
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?
Finish him off!
Smash him!
- Hit him!
- Harder!
Kick his spider ass!
Hit him!
One, two, three!
That's it! That's it!
Winner!
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spiderman!
Now get out of here.
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.
Well, check it again, webhead.
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.
I need that money.
I missed the part
where that's my problem.
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.
Hurry up!
Hey! He stole the gate!
Stop that guy!
Stop him! He's got my money!
Thanks.
What the hell's the matter with you,
you let him go!
Cut him off and call the cops!
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he's going to get away with my money.
I missed the part
where that's my problem.
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?
Old dude, man.
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.
Uncle Ben?
Uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben?
Peter.
I'm here, Uncle Ben.
Peter.
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.
Get a unit to the rear!
I got the back!
Who's there?
Don't hurt me. Just give me a chance.
Just give me a chance!
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?
Answer me!
Stop that guy!
Thanks.
See you.
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.
Oh, no. My God.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, General Slocum.
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
- He's clear! Go!
- I assume you're confident about this test.
Absolutely, Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?
Nothing would please me more
than to put Norman Osborn out of business.
Preflight complete. Mark.
We are picking up an
unidentified object closing fast.
What the hell is that?
Can you see anything?
Oh, my God!
- Say "chess."
- Chess!
Peter!
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.
Pete. Good news. My Father got the place in
New York so we're all set this Friday.
- Oh that's great!
- You made it.
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.
Yeah.
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.
Commencement:
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.
You know what? Whatever.
Your loss.
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.
Can I fix you something?
No, thanks.
I missed him a lot today.
I know.
I miss him too.
But he was there.
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.
You loved him...
...and he loved you.
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.
How you were meant for great things.
You won't disappoint him.
With great power
comes great responsibility.
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.
Hurry up!
This is not a man. My brother saw him building a
nest in the Lincoln Center fountain.
They think he's human.
They think he's a man. Could be a woman.
Bobby. Get a load of this!
He throws up his hands, ropes come out, and
he climbs up the ropes like a spider web.
I see the web and it's a signature,
and I know Spiderman was here.
The guy protects us, you know
protects the people.
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wakadoo.
He stinks and I don't like him.
Don't move, lady!
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.
Those tights and that tight little...
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug
But we should all just give him
One big hug
Look out
Here comes the Spiderman
"Who is Spiderman?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?
Mr. Jameson your wife is on line one
she needs to know if--
- Mr. Jameson there's a page six problem.
-We have a page one problem, shut up.
- Well?
- He's news.
- These are really important clients they can't wait.
- They're about to.
- He pulled six people off that subway car.
- Sure from a wreck he probably caused.
Something goes wrong and this creepy-crawler is there.
Look at that, he's fleeing the scene. What's that tell you?
He's not fleeing, he's probably going to
save somebody else. He's a hero!
Then why's he wear a mask, hmm?
What's he got to hide?
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille in the dining room.
- Whichever's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson it's like this,
We double-booked page six. See so both
Macy's and Conway's have three-quarters of the same page.
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?
Every copy.
Tomorrow morning. Spiderman. Page one with a decent
picture this time. Move Conway to page seven.
- That's a problem.
- Make it page eight and give 'em 10 percent off.
No make it 5 percent.
- That can't be done.
- Get outta here!
Problem is we don't have a decent picture.
Eddie's been on it for weeks, we can barely get a glimpse of him.
Aw, what is he, shy?
We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong
we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo.
Put an ad on the front page.
"Cash money for a picture of Spiderman"
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!
Buzz off.
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm begging for a job. How about you?
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting now?
Yeah.
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.
That's great MJ.
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Hey counter girl!
Your drawer was short six dollars!
Next time that happens,
I'm gonna take it outta your cheque!
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
It better not happen no more, hear me?.
Don't roll your eyes at me.
Some dream, huh?
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
Oh, yeah. Right.
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.
No, I guess not.
Thanks, Pete.
We should catch up sometime.
Let's get some lunch some evening.
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.
I won't.
I won't tell Harry.
Timing's perfect. Hey.
Five new contracts. It'll be great.
Stormin' Norman's making his weekly inspection.
Spent half of it on the phone.
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.
Are you all right?
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.
You were late again?
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?
Around.
Peter Parker.
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.
- When do I get to meet her?
- Dad!
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?
Dad, maybe you can help him out.
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.
I couldn't accept it. I'd like to earn
what I get. I can find my own work.
I respect that.
You want to make it on your own steam.
That's great.
What other skills do you have Parker?
I was thinking of something in photography.
Hello.
Let's go! Move it!
Watch the street!
Cheese!
They're crap.
Crap, crap. Megacrap.
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.
Take them somewhere else then.
- Sir your wife said that tile you want in the foyer is out of stock.
- Tell her we'll just put a rug there.
Sit down. Give me that.
I'll give you 300.
That's a standard freelance fee.
- Tear up page one. Run that photo instead.
- Headline?
"Spiderman, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."
- Menace? He was protecting that--
- Tell you what, Atticus you take the pictures
I'll make up the headlines, ok? all right?
That ok with you.
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.
Bring me some more shots of that newspaper selling clown,
maybe I'll take 'em off your hands.
But I never said you have a job. Meat.
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Best I can do. Get outta here.
Bring me more photos.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.
- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.
I'm Peter Parker.
I'm a photographer.
Yes. I can see that.
As of today...
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...
...costs are down, revenues are up...
...and our stock
has never been higher.
Wonderful news, Norman. Woderful.
In fact, it's the reason for selling the company.
What?
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing
in the wake of the bombing. Expanding.
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.
Why wasn't I told?
The last thing they want is a power struggle
with entrenched management.
The deal is off if you come with it.
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.
You can't do this to me.
I started this company.
You know how much I sacrificed?!
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.
I'm sorry.
You're out, Norman.
Am I?
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.
I think you're beautiful.
MJ would you do me a favour?
I forgot my drink inside.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.
What is that?
That's our glider!
What the hell was that?
Code three! Code three!
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!
Harry! Help me! Harry!
Out, am I?
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!
Hello, my dear.
It's Spiderman!
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!
Somebody help him!
No!
Mommy!
- Hold it right there!
- I surrender.
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!
Impressive.
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!
Hold on!
Watch out!
We'll meet again, Spiderman!
Hold on Mary Jane!
Well, beats taking the subway.
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.
Wait.
Who are you?
- You know who I am.
- I do?
Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'm going to come over.
No, I'm gonna come...
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?
And we'll go and have breakfast and...
...I want to buy you something.
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs...
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.
You're right.
I didn't.
I'm gonna get some rest.
I'm gonna stay up for a while.
What was that thing?
I don't know.
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.
Somebody there?
Somebody.
Somebody.
Who said that?
Don't play the innocent with me.
You've known all along.
Where are you?
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.
I'm right here.
I don't understand.
Did you think it was coincidence?
So many good things,
all happening for you.
All for you. Norman.
What do you want?
To say what you won't.
To do what you can't.
To remove those in your way.
The board members.
You killed them.
We killed them.
We?
Remember?
Your little accident
in the laboratory.
The performance enhancers.
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:
Power beyond your wildest dreams.
And it's only the beginning.
There's only one who can stop us.
Or imagine if he joined us.
Spiderman. And the Green Goblin.
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.
- These weirdo's all gotta have a name now.
- Mr. Jameson Spiderman...
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?
Call the patent office, copyright the name Green Goblin,
I want a quarter every time somebody says it.
How about "Green Meanie"?
Spiderman wasn't attacking the city he was
trying to save it. That's slander.
It is not. I resent that.
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.
You don't trust anybody, that's your problem.
I trust my barber.
What are you his lawyer? Get out of here!
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...
Jameson, you slime.
Who's the photographer who takes the
pictures of Spiderman?
- I don't know who he is. His stuff comes in the mail.
- Liar!
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.
Set him down, tough guy.
- Speak of the devil.
- Spiderman! I knew you two were in this together.
Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?.
Sleep...
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.
No, you're not dead yet.
Just paralyzed...
...temporarily.
You're an amazing creature,
Spiderman.
You and I are not so different.
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.
Well, to each his own.
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.
Why bother?
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.
There are eight million people
in this city.
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.
You, me...
...we're exceptional.
I could squash you like a bug
right now.
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.
What we could create.
Or we could destroy.
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?
Think about it, hero.
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.
It's me again.
How was your audition?
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...
...told my aunt, told me.
So you just came by?
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...
So how'd it go?
They said I needed acting lessons.
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.
I'd like a cheeseburger.
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.
Come with us.
No, thanks. How's it going with...?
Never mind.
That's none of my business.
It's not?
Why so interested?
I'm not.
You're not?
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.
Why would you be?
I, that's a...
I don't know.
Sorry you won't come with us.
I'd better run, tiger.
Hey, check it out, man.
Come on, man.
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!
Get off me!
Wait!
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.
I was in the neighborhood.
You are amazing.
Some people don't think so.
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.
Do I get to say thank you this time?
Wait.
I have to get in there! My baby's in there!
My baby's in there!
- Let me go!
- I can't let you in there, the roof's about to collapse.
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!
Look! Up there!
Save my baby, please!
No!
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!
God bless you, Spiderman.
Bless you.
Don't let him get away!
Hold it right there! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!
I'm going.
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back chief.
Go! Go!
Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out of here!
It's okay.
You're pathetically predictable.
Like a moth to the flame.
What about my generous proposal?
Are you in or are you out?
- It's you who's out Gobby. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.
Oh, great.
No one says no to me!
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.
He's here.
Are you ready?
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.
Who is this lovely young lady?
I'd like you to meet my father Norman Osborn.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
How do you do?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.
Peter?
Is that you?
How strange. There's nobody here.
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!
Sorry I'm late.
It's a jungle out there.
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...
...and we can say grace.
Here we go.
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.
Will you do the honors?
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
Oh, yeah, I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.
Well, let me see.
Oh, my goodness.
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving in this apartment
and we are going to do things properly.
How did you say that happened?
Bike messenger.
Knocked me down.
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.
- Why?
Something has come to my attention.
Are you all right?
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!
Dad, what are you doing?
I plan this whole thing so you can meet MJ
and now you've got to leave?
I've got to go.
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.
Do you think a woman like that is sniffing
around because she likes your personality?
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.
They're all beautiful until they're snarling after
your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
You're wrong about her Dad.
A word to the not so wise about your little girlfriend,
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.
That creep is my father, all right
If I'm lucky I'll become half of what he is
so just keep your mouth shut
about stuff you don't understand.
Harry Osborn!
I'm sorry, Aunt May.
Spiderman is all but invincible.
But Parker, we can destroy him.
I can't.
Betrayal must not be countenanced.
Parker must be educated.
What do I do?
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.
Yes?
And then grant his wish.
But how?
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.
Tell me how!
The heart, Osborn.
First, we attack his heart.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...
Deliver us!
Finish it!
- Finish it!
- From evil!
Two milligrams IV.
Get the BP.
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?
Yes she's going to be ok.
Look you're going to have to leave right now.
- What happened?
- Those eyes!
Those horrible yellow eyes!
He knows who I am.
I'm sorry.
- Will she be okay?
- She's going to be fine.
She's been sleeping all day.
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.
How are you?
You okay about the other night?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.
I haven't called him back.
The fact is...
...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?
At least I think I am.
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.
Would I know his name, this guy?
You'll think I'm a stupid little
girl with a crush.
Trust me.
It's funny.
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say about him?
No, no, not Spiderman,
not a chance in the world.
I know him a little bit.
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.
What'd he say?
I said...
He asked me what I thought about you.
And what did you say?
I said, "Spiderman."
I said, "The great thing about M. J...
...is...
...when you look in her eyes...
...and she's looking back in yours...
...everything feels...
...not quite normal.
Because you feel...
...stronger...
...and weaker at the same time.
You feel excited...
...and at the same time...
...terrified.
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.
It's as if you've...
...reached the unreachable...
...and you weren't ready for it."
You said that?
Well, something like that.
Dad?
Dad, is that you?
What is it?
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.
She's in love with Peter.
- Parker?
- Yeah.
And how does he feel about her?
He's loved her since the 4th grade.
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.
I'm so sorry.
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.
That's no excuse.
I'm proud of you.
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you, Harry.
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.
Wake up, little spider.
Wake up.
Go home, dear.
You look awful.
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.
A smile. Finally.
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.
Hey, you were supposed to be asleep.
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J. 's family moved in next door.
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, aunt May, is that an angel?"
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.
Well, Harry's in love with her.
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.
You're so mysterious all the time.
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?
Everybody else knows.
I'll be right back.
But...
Come on, pick up.
- Hey M.J.
-Hi. Sing your song at the beep.
M.J., it's Peter. You there?
Hello? You there?
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?
All right, well...
Don't...
Don't go up any dark alleys.
Hello?
Can Spiderman come out to play?
Where is she?
- What is that?
- That's cool!
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out
Goblin, what have you done?
Spiderman!
This is why only fools are heroes.
Because you never know...
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:
Let die the woman you love...
...or suffer the little children.
- Spiderman!
- Save us!
Save us!
Make your choice, Spiderman...
...and see how a hero is rewarded.
Don't do it, Goblin!
We are who we choose to be.
- Now, choose!
- No!
Everybody stay still!
Ahoy up there!
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!
M.J., you can do it. You have to.
Trust me.
Hold on tight and go quickly.
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.
Hang on, Mary Jane!
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!
It's time to die.
Come on up here dumb gu
I got a little something for ya.
Leave Spiderman alone.
You gonna pick on a guy trying to save a bunch of kids?
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!
Spiderman, watch out!
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.
I offered you friendship...
...and you spat in my face.
You've spun your last web, Spiderman.
Had you not been so selfish, your little
girlfriend's death
...would have been quick and painless.
But now that you've really
pissed me off...
...l'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.
M.J. and I...
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.
Peter, stop!
Stop! It's me.
Mr. Osborn.
Peter, thank God for you.
You killed those people
on that balcony.
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!
Don't let him take me again.
I beg you. Protect me.
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.
But not you.
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.
I would never hurt you.
I knew from the beginning...
...if anything ever happened to me...
...it was you I could count on.
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.
Thank God for you.
Give me your hand.
Believe in me
as I believed in you.
I've been like a father to you.
Be a son to me now.
I have a father.
His name was Ben Parker.
Godspeed, Spiderman.
Peter.
Don't tell Harry.
What have you done?
What have you done?!
I'm so sorry, Harry.
I know what it's like
to lose a father.
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.
One day Spiderman will pay.
I swear on my father's grave,
Spiderman will pay.
Thank God for you, Peter.
You're the only family I have.
No matter what I do...
... no matter how hard I try...
... the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.
You must miss him so much.
It's been so hard without him.
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.
When I was up there...
...and I thought I was gonna die...
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
It was you, Pete.
I kept thinking:
"I hope I make it through this...
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."
Really?
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...
...who makes me feel...
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.
That I'm just...
...me.
And that's okay.
The truth is...
...I love you.
I love you so much, Peter.
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.
I can't...
You can't what?
Tell you...
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.
Yeah. There's so much to tell.
I want you to know...
...that I will always be there
for you.
I will always be there
to take care of you.
I promise you that.
I will always be your friend.
Only a friend...
...Peter Parker?
That's all I have to give.
Whatever life holds in store for me...
I will never forget these words,
"With great power
comes great responsibility. "
This is my gift.
My curse.
Who am I?
I'm Spiderman.

She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.
Parker. Parker!
No, no, no, stop! Stop!
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep- dish pizzas.
I told you,
I don't understand that language.
- Speak English.
- You can't make pizza.
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.
- Why didn't you send Saleem?
- Saleem was deported yesterday.
- Look... Smiley.
- What about my cheese pizza?
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7,5 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
Hey, what, are you stupid?
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.
Yes, Mr. Spider- Man.
See you.
Way to go, Spidey!
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
Elevator.
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.
You're fired.
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
- Boss.
- Not now.
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho
Spider- Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take
any more pictures.
You turned the whole city
against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
- It's your wife, she lost her chequebook.
- Thanks for the good news.
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.
All right, Mr. Jameson.
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."
I told you, he's not a menace.
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.
That's outrageous.
Done. Give this to the girl.
Thank you. Bye- bye.
Hi.
Hey, Pete.
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.
- Right.
- Sorry.
Hey.
Chin up, okay?
Watch it, jerk!
Dr. Connors. Sorry.
Where were you headed, Parker?
To your class.
My class is over.
See me standing here?
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.
Then be here.
Look at you, Peter.
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.
You always appear exhausted.
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.
Planning is not a major
at this university.
Octavius is a friend of mine.
Better do your research, Parker.
Get it done, or I'm failing you.
Surprise!
Well, say something.
What's the occasion?
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!
Whether you want
to remember it or not.
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Long time, no see.
So how's the play?
I read a great review.
It's going fine. It's going good.
She's brilliant in it.
Harry sent me roses.
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider- Man?
How's the bug these days?
The less you see of that man,
the better.
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.
Thank you.
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.
M.J., could you give me a hand?
She's waiting for you, pal.
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
Why, are you dead?
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
Could we get off that subject?
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?
Peter, don't you understand
how I feel?
I want this guy dead.
The same way you want the guy
who killed your Uncle Ben dead.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
rag on you on your birthday.
You're my buddy, you know that.
You're family, Pete.
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.
Thank you, Harry.
May.
Oh, what, Ben?
Wait.
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.
Everybody's gone, aren't they?
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
Oh, my. You did?
Oh, well.
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!
You can take this money from me.
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!
And don't you dare leave it here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?
I think to myself at times...
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.
Now...
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey. You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.
The photographer liked my face.
I was only supposed to be
in the catalogue.
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.
Your dream came true.
How about yours?
I'm fine.
I wish you'd come see the play.
You're the one who
always encouraged me.
I plan to.
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.
Oh, boy, yeah.
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was...
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
What?
Happy birthday.
I'm seeing somebody now.
- Therapy.
- No.
A person, a man.
You mean, like a boyfriend?
Well, like I like him.
What?
Nothing.
That's good, you know?
Companionship...
May be more than that.
More?
I don't know.
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.
Don't disappoint me.
I won't.
Rent.
- Hi.
- Hi. What's " hi"?
Can I spend it?
I have a paycheque due this week
and...
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.
Hello?
Rent?
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.
It's not about the prizes, Harry.
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.
Who do we have here?
This is my good friend
I called you about.
He got me through
high-school science.
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...
I know what you're doing here...
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!
Interesting fellow, your friend.
I won't take much of your time.
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.
He also tells me you're lazy.
I'm trying to do better.
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.
And you use it
for the good of mankind.
Otto, your lunch is ready.
- This is my wife, Rosie.
- Hello.
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.
I always fell asleep in physics class.
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- Good to meet you.
Excuse me.
Is that it?
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.
Sympathetic frequencies.
Harmonic reinforcement?
Go on.
An exponential increase
in energy output.
A huge amount of energy.
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.
It's all so amazing. If it works,
it could change the way we live.
It is amazing, and it will work.
Are you sure you could stabilise
the fusion reaction?
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?
This is my life's work.
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.
You can sleep soundly tonight.
Otto's done his homework.
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?
Rosie, I love this boy.
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well...
I don't really know.
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.
Love should never be a secret.
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...
...gonna make you sick.
I finally got lucky in love.
We both did.
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.
Time present and time past
- Are both perhaps present
- Perhaps present
- In time future
- In time future
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.
Poetry.
Never fails.
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie
Brightest green were all her garments
And her hair was lik e the sunshine
Day by day he gazed upon her
Rent!
Where is my money?!
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
Work out, plenty of rest.
You know, eat your green vegetables.
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on. Go.
Keep it steady.
It's a web.
Go, Spidey, go!
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should
forgive them?
Yes.
I mean, no.
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.
It helps maintain the illusion.
I understand.
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.
But not to come late.
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...
Listen, can't you...?
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man
A-does whatever a spider can
A-spins a web, any size
Catches thieves a-just lik e flies
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?
Yeah, I'm sure.
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?
What are you doing here?
You hungry?
Starved.
What was that?
Okay.
How you doing?
Good.
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.
- Think it's great.
- Thanks.
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols & Knudsen...
...PR firm in the building...
...and I just wanna say I think
the image you have is fantastic.
It's really put together.
The costume. The... this thing.
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.
I think you could do more
than print though.
I think you might wanna try some TV,
you know?
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?
How about a children's book?
You could...
Like Charlotte's Web,
but without the pig. That kind of thing.
How about a line of hammocks?
Because it's kind of a web thing.
You could do a men's cologne
called Thwip.
Let me give you a card.
I don't have any pockets.
Yeah.
Well, we're right in the building.
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.
- Slow elevator.
- Yeah.
Thus, the second-order term...
...in the expansion of
the exact order...
...is identical to the second order...
...calculated from first-order
perturbation energy.
Since we are free to choose
an arbitrary origin for our energy...
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.
Hi, M.J..
This is Peter.
I was on my way to your show and...
Well, I was on my bike...
Are you there?
I really was planning on it all day.
And...
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.
Bingo.
It's amazing, isn't it?
How complicated a simple thing...
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.
Your time has expired.
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.
I wanna tell you the truth.
Here it is.
I'm Spider- Man.
Weird, huh?
Now you know
why I can't be with you.
If my enemies found out about you...
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.
But first, before we start...
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?
Because we found the rubber band.
It's a terrible joke.
But thank you for coming.
Today...
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.
And now let me introduce
my assistants.
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...
...is as advanced as you suggest...
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?
How right you are.
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...
...to protect
my higher brain function.
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.
And now on to the main event.
Give me the blue light, Rosie.
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...fasten your seat belts.
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.
Thank you.
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.
The power of the sun...
...in the palm of my hand.
Keep calm! It's only a spike!
It'll soon stabilise!
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.
We have a containment breach!
Otto, please get back!
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!
It will stabilise! It's under control!
I'm in charge here!
It's my money! I'm in con...
This doesn't change anything.
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.
No!
Rosie!
Watch it.
That was too close.
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.
I'm ruined.
I have nothing left,
except Spider- Man.
He saved your life, sir.
He humiliated me by touching me.
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.
What was he doing here anyway?
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.
We're ready, doctor.
Anybody here take shop class?
No! No! No!
Help me! Help me!
No!
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumours.
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?
Hoffman!
What are we gonna call this guy?
- "Dr. Octopus".
- That's crap.
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!
- "Dr. Strange".
- That's pretty good.
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus".
- I like it.
- Of course you do.
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
" Doc Ock".
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?
Get out.
Chief, I found Parker.
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!
I heard Spider- Man was there.
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.
Chief, the planetarium party.
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.
What do you know
about high society?
- Oh. Well, I...
- Don't answer that.
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.
Could you pay me in advance?
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.
My Rosie's dead.
My dream is dead.
And these...
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...
...along with me.
Something...
...in my head.
Something talking.
The inhibitor chip!
Gone.
Rebuild.
No.
Peter was right.
I miscalculated.
I couldn't have miscalculated.
It was working, wasn't it?
Yes.
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.
But we need money.
Steal it?
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.
That's right.
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.
We'll do it here.
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.
Nothing will stand in our way.
Nothing!
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.
My uncle Ben's life insurance.
Yes, but I'm afraid...
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.
You are?
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...
...a new supersaver account
with us today.
But the fact is...
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.
Well...
At least we get the toaster.
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.
Oh, yes, I see.
Okay.
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
Peter?
Don't leave me.
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.
Hold it!
Put your arms up! All of them!
Here's your change!
Oh, no. Come on!
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.
Not anymore.
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.
Wait a second.
- Hand her over.
- Of course.
Easy, now.
Butterfingers.
Look out!
Help me!
- Help me!
- I'm coming!
Hang on!
Help!
Thank you.
Aunt May.
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.
Come on.
Shame on you.
There you go.
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.
We sure showed him.
What do you mean, "we"?
- Take me with you, Spider- Man.
- Take me.
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Penny! Over here!
Leave it.
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.
Why? It's a party.
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?
Not to mention your friend the bug.
Not tonight, Harry.
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.
Parker!
Parker!
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.
Beautiful tie.
Get a shot of us with the DA.
Beautiful dress.
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.
Wife.
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...
...is pleased to present
our guest of honour.
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...
...Captain John Jameson.
Hi.
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.
But there was a disturbance.
I don't know you.
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.
I've been reading poetry lately.
Whatever that means.
Day by day he gazed upon her
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...
Don't start.
Can I get you a drink?
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.
John.
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.
Even my father.
He came backstage to borrow cash.
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.
After all these years...
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider- Man and not to your best friend.
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.
Don't act like you're my friend.
You stole M.J. from me.
You stole my father's love.
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?
Huh? Isn't that right?
Huh, brother?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.
What a surprise.
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!
Oh, no. No!
Why is this happening to me?
You told him yes? Just that fast?
It felt right.
Well, you might congratulate me.
Congratulations.
Good luck in the world.
John loves me.
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.
No man will ever want you."
So, what, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...
...trying to prove something
to your father?
Do you really love this guy?
- Very much.
- "Very much"?
That just doesn't fly.
I mean, if you really love the guy,
then the answer is:
"Do I love him? I adore him.
He's my comfortable afghan.
He's all I can think about.
Everything he is, everything he says,
everything he does...
...to me, for me, with me,
is sweet kisses.
He makes up for all the grief
and pain I've ever had...
...and in the dark of the night,
he is there."
That's the answer I need.
Not just "I love him very much".
You read too many love stories.
What about that perfect kiss
you said you had once?
- The guy you believed in?
- That was a fantasy.
That's all he is.
But what's wrong with believing
in love stories?
You seem very okay to me.
My diagnosis?
It's up here.
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?
There is one dream where...
...in my dream...
...I'm Spider- Man.
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.
So you're Spider- Man.
In my dream.
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.
So it's somebody else's dream.
- What's your major? Theatre Arts?
- Science.
Connors?
He flunking you?
He says he might.
There you go.
What about this friend?
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.
I've been there. Who was I?
Identity. Big one.
Me, I go to my shrink.
What does he tell you?
She tells me I need some
strong focus on what I want.
And I have to find out
who won't let me have it, why...
...and then I have to tackle that guy,
let him hear me...
And one more thing. I have to
make sure I'm right about what I want.
Listen...
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider- Man climbing those walls.
That's why you keep falling.
You always have a choice, Peter.
I have a choice.
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...
...make me sad.
Can't you understand?
I'm in love with Mary Jane.
You know I understand.
But I thought you'd learned
the meaning of responsibility.
Oh, you don't know how it feels.
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...
...fairness, justice...
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...
...to take those dreams
out into the world.
I can't live your dreams anymore.
I want a life of my own.
You've been given a gift, Peter.
With great power
comes great responsibility.
Take my hand, son.
No, Uncle Ben.
I'm just Peter Parker.
I'm Spider-Man...
...no more.
No more.
No more.
- You punk!
- Sorry.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Hurry up!
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are?
Someone, please?
.23 electron volts.
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...
...in a very inexcusable manner.
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.
That would be hypocrisy.
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.
" I am glad."
" I am glad."
" I am glad."
Are you glad to hear it?
I am glad...
...to hear it.
In fact, now you mention
the subject...
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.
You could've told me
you were coming.
I was afraid you'd say,
" Don't come."
You look different.
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.
I do my homework now.
You wanna get some chow mein?
Peter...
...l'm getting married.
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.
And who's the groom?
You hadn't decided yet.
You think just because
you saw my play...
...you can talk me out
of getting married?
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.
You're too late.
Will you think about it?
Think about what?
Picking up where we left off.
Where was that?
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.
I don't think it's that simple.
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.
You don't understand.
I'm not an empty seat anymore.
I'm different.
Punch me, I bleed.
I have to go.
I'm getting married in a church.
You are different.
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.
Where the hell did you get that?
In the garbage.
In the garbage?
He must've given up.
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.
Your wife is still on that line.
Flowers? How much?
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.
Get plastic.
Gotta go, big story.
Spider-Man
Spider-Man
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?
Come on, man. Get the money.
Come on, come on.
Help!
Come on!
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.
He was a peaceful man.
And it was all my doing.
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.
Oh, I know I shouldn't.
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...
...and he wanted to drive you.
If only I had stopped him.
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.
I'm responsible.
For what?
For what happened to Uncle Ben.
But you were at the library.
You were doing your homework.
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.
What do you mean?
I went someplace else.
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...
...to buy a car, because I wanted...
...to impress Mary Jane.
It happened so fast.
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.
The thief...
...was running towards me.
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...
...revenge.
I let him go.
I let him get away.
He wanted a car.
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.
Uncle Ben said no...
...and then he shot him.
Uncle Ben was killed that night...
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.
And I...
I held his hand...
...when he died.
I've tried to tell you so many times.
Just one more little chore.
Where are you?
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.
Your father only obsessed
over his work.
Good night, Bernard.
Hello, Harry.
Otto. What do you want?
That precious tritium.
But I need more of it this time.
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!
Hey! Hey!
Stop! Stop! All right!
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.
Kill Spider- Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.
How do I find him?
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?
He takes pictures of Spider- Man
for the Bugle.
Make him tell you where he is.
Have it ready.
Don't hurt Peter!
Somebody, help!
Fire!
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.
Hey, where you going?!
I'm coming!
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Come on. Come on.
Mama.
You got some guts, kid.
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.
Oh, man.
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?
What I need?
What am I supposed to do?
I shouldn't have without...
...knocking.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?
Okay.
And a glass of milk?
That would be nice.
Okay.
Thank you.
You got a message.
It's your aunt.
Thanks.
What's going on?
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...
...and I'm giving him $5.
That's Henry Jackson?
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.
Nine years old, has great ambitions.
Listen, about my last visit...
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.
And I'm proud of you.
And I thank you, and I...
I love you, Peter.
So very, very much.
Hey. Where are all my comic books?
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.
You're getting tall.
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.
Okay. You take
Spider- Man's pictures, right?
I used to.
Where is he?
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.
He...
...quit.
- Why?
Wanted to try other things.
He'll be back, right?
I don't know.
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.
Spider- Man.
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...
...saving old girls like me.
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...
...setting examples for all of us.
Everybody loves a hero.
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...
...just to get a glimpse of the one...
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.
I believe there's a hero in all of us...
...that keeps us honest...
...gives us strength...
...makes us noble...
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...
...and give up the thing
we want the most.
Even our dreams.
Spider- Man did that for Henry...
...and he wonders where he's gone.
He needs him.
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?
But don't strain yourself.
Okay.
Strong focus on what I want.
I'm back!
I'm back!
My back.
My back.
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?
Peter Parker?
Positive.
Thought he was your pal.
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.
He's just a great big jerk.
The world's full of great big jerks.
You're adorable.
It's just the uniform.
Lean your head back for me.
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.
Just put my head back?
Okay.
Wow.
I'm back on the moon.
You up there with me?
- Hiya.
- Surprised?
Very.
Thanks for coming.
Everything okay?
You might say so.
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.
I was afraid to trust you.
But I've been thinking about it...
Listen, there's more for me to say.
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?
I'm saying...
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...
...but I can't.
My mind was playing tricks too.
Do you love me, or not?
I...
...don't.
You don't.
Kiss me.
Kiss you?
I need to know something.
Just one kiss.
What's happening?
Peter Parker...
...and the girlfriend.
What do you want?
I want you to find your friend
Spider- Man.
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.
I don't know where he is.
Find him.
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.
If you lay one finger on her...
You'll do what?
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiance.
Sorry, Jonah.
It's all my fault.
I drove Spider- Man away.
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.
Yes.
Spider- Man was a hero.
I just couldn't see it.
He was a...
A thief! A criminal!
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!
I want him strung up by his web!
I want Spider- Man!
Where is she?
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.
What the hell?
You have a train to catch.
Help!
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!
- It's Spider- Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!
Tell everyone to hang on!
Brace yourselves!
Any more bright ideas?
I got a few, yeah!
Whoa, watch out!
We're slowing down.
Nice and easy, we'll go down.
Slower. Gently.
Is he alive?
He's...
...just a kid.
No older than my son.
It's all right.
We found something.
We won't tell nobody.
It's good to have you back,
Spider- Man.
He's mine!
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.
And me.
Me too.
Very well.
Where do you want him?
And the tritium?
Yes.
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.
First we'll see who's behind the mask.
I can look into your eyes as you die.
Pete.
No.
It can't be.
Harry.
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.
Tritium?
He's making the machine again.
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...
...you killed my father.
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.
Hey!
Hey!
I'm talking to you!
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider- Man's dead.
He's not dead.
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.
Surprise.
As soon as you get free...
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.
Well, I'm not.
Hang on, Mary Jane!
Run!
Let's see you scurry out of this.
Now what?
Dr. Octavius.
We have to shut it down.
Please tell me how.
Peter Parker?
" Brilliant but lazy."
Look at what's happening.
We must destroy it.
I can't destroy it.
I won't.
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.
A privilege.
These things have turned you
into something you're not.
Don't listen to them.
It was my dream.
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...
...and give up the thing
we want the most.
Even our dreams.
You're right.
He's right.
Listen.
Listen to me now.
Listen to me now.
Now, tell me how to stop it.
It can't be stopped.
It's self-sustaining now.
- Think!
- Unless...
The river.
Drown it.
I'll do it.
No!
Hi.
Hi.
This is really heavy.
M.J.
In case we die...
You do love me.
I do.
Even though you said you didn't.
I will not die a monster.
I think I always knew...
...all this time...
...who you really were.
Then you know
why we can't be together.
Spider- Man will always have enemies.
I can't let you take that risk.
I will...
...always be Spider- Man.
You and I can never be.
Mary Jane!
Hello?
Who's that?
Son.
I'm here.
Dad?
- I thought you were...
- No.
I'm alive in you, Harry.
Now it's your turn.
You swore to make Spider- Man pay.
Now make him pay.
But Pete's my best friend.
And I'm your father.
You're weak.
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.
Now you know the truth about Peter.
Be strong, Harry.
Avenge me.
- Avenge me!
- No!
Call Deborah.
The caterer?
Tell her not to open the caviar.
Had to do what I had to do.
Mary Jane.
Peter.
I can't survive without you.
You shouldn't be here.
I know you think we can't be together.
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?
I know there'll be risks.
But I want to face them with you.
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...
...half of ourselves.
I love you.
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.
I've always been
standing in your doorway.
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?
Well, say something.
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.
Go get them, tiger.

I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.
You're here because I need you.
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?
No. This one's special.
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?
Yeah, the brochure is great.
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?
- Illness?
- John.
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.
Of course.
Jean, can you come down, dear?
We'll leave you, then.
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.
Really? I doubt that.
Oh, Charles.
I like this one.
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.
The question is, will you control that power?
Or let it control you?
Warren? Son, is everything all right?
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.
Open the door. Warren.
One second!
Open this door.
Warren.
Let me in there right now. Open the door.
Oh, God.
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.
Bobby!
Thanks, Kitty.
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.
That was my last cigar.
Logan.
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.
Class dismissed.
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.
Simulation complete.
- What was that?
- Danger room session.
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.
- Scott!
- Jean.
Scott. Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.
No, you didn't. The professor did.
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.
Hey, look.
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.
Maybe it's time for us to move on.
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.
Mr. President.
Have a seat, Hank.
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.
Yes, sir. She can do that.
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.
Where is Magneto?
Raven?
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?
In here with us.
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.
You don't want to play games with me?
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?
You wanna know where he is?
Homo sapien.
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.
It's what she stole from the FDA.
Dear Lord.
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.
When an individual acquires great power,
the use or misuse of that power is everything.
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.
Why? Because we are mutants.
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern
without any superhuman authority behind it.
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,
say a father of four with terminal cancer,
into the body of this man?
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...
Professor?
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.
The forecast was for sunny skies.
I'm sorry.
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.
Yes, but we can't be students forever.
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.
He took Jean's death so hard.
Yes, things are better out there,
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.
There's something you're not telling us.
Hank?
Ororo. Charles.
I love what you've done with your hair.
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.
- Suppress?
- Permanently.
They're calling it a cure.
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?
Storm.
They're announcing it now.
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I proudly present the answer to mutation.
Finally, we have a cure.
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?
Not all of us can fit in so easily.
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.
No. Professor.
They can't cure us.
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.
Or any of us, for that matter.
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.
Nobody is talking about extermination.
No one ever talks about it.
They just do it.
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,
the extermination has already begun.
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.
They will force their cure upon us.
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?
Who will you stand with? The humans?
Or us?
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.
Back off.
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.
You know who you're talking to?
Do you?
And what can you do?
So you have talents?
That and more. I know you control metal.
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.
Other than you two.
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?
Could you locate one for me?
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.
Oh, Mr. President.
Shut up.
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.
Please.
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.
Yeah, right.
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.
And his power? What is its range?
You'll see.
Jimmy.
There's someone I would like you to meet.
Hello there, son.
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.
Extraordinary, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.
Stop!
Jean?
Scott.
How?
I don't know.
I wanna see your eyes.
- Take these off.
- No.
No.
Trust me. I can control it now.
Open them. You can't hurt me.
- What happened?
- No clue.
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?
I can't see a damn thing.
I can take care of that.
What the...
Logan!
She's alive.
Jean.
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.
The only explanation of Jean's survival
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.
Is she gonna be OK?
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.
What have you done to her?
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.
History will be made here today.
For the first time,
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.
Good. Bring him in.
Are you sure you want to start with him?
I think it's important. Yes.
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.
You ready?
The transformation can be a little jarring.
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.
It'll all be over soon.
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.
Warren, calm down.
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.
Warren, it's a better life.
- It's what we all want.
- No.
It's what you want.
Warren, no!
Told you so.
About time.
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.
Without him, they have nothing.
Read off the guest list.
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."
This one robbed seven banks.
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."
How fascinating.
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.
No!
You saved me.
Eric.
I'm sorry, my dear.
You're not one of us any more.
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?
I have.
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.
As do I.
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.
Jean.
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
More than OK.
Logan, you're making me blush.
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.
It's OK.
It's OK.
- Wait.
- No.
Jean.
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.
The professor said you might be different.
He would know, wouldn't he?
What? You think he's not in your head too?
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.
Where's Scott?
Jean?
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.
Jean, tell me what happened to him.
Oh, God.
Look at me.
Stay with me. Talk to me.
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.
Focus. Focus, Jean.
Kill me.
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.
- Don't say that.
- Please.
- Stop it.
- Kill me.
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.
It'll be all right. We can help you.
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.
I don't want to fix it.
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.
I told you they would draw first blood.
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.
Come. We have an army to build.
I picked something up.
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.
It's a mutant.
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.
More powerful than you.
Where is she?
Logan.
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?
What have you done?
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.
It may be too late.
- Wait for me here.
- What?
I need to see Jean alone.
You were right, Charles.
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.
So, shall we go inside?
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.
Funny, you sound just like her parents.
Nobody gets inside.
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.
- So you want to control me?
- He does.
No. I want to help you.
Help me? What's wrong with me?
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.
For your own good, Jean.
Stay out of my head.
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.
Get out of my head.
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.
No! Stop it!
That's it.
Jean, let me in.
No, Jean.
Jean!
Don't let it control you.
Charles.
My dear. Come with me.
No.
God!
We live in an age of darkness.
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.
A world he tried to heal.
A mission he never saw accomplished.
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.
And that's a vision of a world united.
Kitty.
Bobby.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
It's just... Xavier came to my house.
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.
Yeah, me too.
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.
You have Rogue and I have...
You know, I just miss home.
The first snow and all that.
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.
Don't worry. We won't get caught.
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.
Come on.
This place can be home too.
Thank you for this, Bobby.
You need a lift, kid?
No.
Where are you going?
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.
Yeah, I do.
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.
A hug. A handshake.
A kiss.
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.
Look, if you wanna go, then go.
Just be sure it's what you want.
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?
To go upstairs and unpack?
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.
Just think about what I said, Rogue.
Marie.
Marie.
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"
I can manipulate the metal in this,
but you, you can do anything.
Anything you can think of.
Jean.
Enough.
Enough.
You sound just like him.
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.
As nature intended.
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.
And that fight begins now.
She shouldn't be here with us.
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.
So what now? What do we do?
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.
It was, son.
And it still is. We'll find you a room.
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.
Rogue.
Hey, Rogue.
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.
Logan.
Logan.
- Logan.
- Jean?
Logan. Where am I? Logan.
Logan. Logan.
- Logan.
- Stop.
Logan. Logan. Logan.
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.
She killed the professor.
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.
Listen, why can't you see the truth?
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...
Because you love her.
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.
So if you're with us, then be with us.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?
I'm looking for someone.
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.
Come on, Iceman.
Make a move.
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.
Today's attack was only our first salvo.
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...
Join us or stay out of our way.
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.
Let's go. Keep it moving.
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.
Absolutely no metal.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.
They have their weapons.
We have ours.
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,
take control of the cure,
and destroy its source.
And then nothing can stop us.
Jean.
I know the smell of your domatium
from a mile away.
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.
And you stood there and let him die?
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.
OK.
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
Approaching target dead ahead.
Set for 360-degree incursion.
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.
OK, send them in.
OK.
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!
OK. I give up.
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.
Leave that to me.
Storm. Storm.
What are you doing back here?
I need help.
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.
Let's suit up.
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.
Yeah. We're outnumbered.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
But we lost Scott.
We lost the professor.
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Are you?
Then we stand together.
X-Men.
All of us.
We're in.
Let's go.
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?
Dad, what's going on?
It's an earthquake.
We're trapped.
Charles always wanted to build bridges.
My God.
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!
In chess, the pawns go first.
Humans and their guns.
Plastic. They've learned.
That's why the pawns go first.
Target the bridge.
Fire!
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.
Then God help us.
They're coming for him.
Don't ever do that again.
You men cover the doors!
Everybody get together! And hold this line!
Traitors to their own cause.
Finish them!
Not yet.
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.
With pleasure.
Hold it!
He's going for the boy!
Not if I get there first.
Kitty!
Come on.
Grow those back.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.
Going somewhere?
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?
Yes, I am.
Girls.
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.
Calm down. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be OK.
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."
Oh, you get the point.
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.
No.
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.
This way.
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.
Who's hiding, dickhead?
Don't. No.
Don't.
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.
Do we look like we need your help?
It's time to end this war.
Take cover.
Get out of the way.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.
Go! Go! Go!
We work as a team.
Best defense is a good offence.
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?
Go ahead.
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.
Right.
You're in over your head, Bobby.
Maybe you should go back to school.
You never should have left.
This is it.
Hey.
Make it a strike.
You never learn, do you?
Actually, I do.
I'm...
One of them?
This is what they want for all of us.
It's over, Jean.
It's over.
No! Don't shoot!
No!
Everybody get out of there!
Bobby!
What have I done?
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.
Go.
Jean!
Jean!
I know you're still there!
You would die for them?
No, not for them.
For you.
For you.
Save me.
I love you.
You're back.
I'm sorry.
I had to.
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.
It's what I want.
Hey.
Good to see you, buddy.
With the thanks of a grateful nation
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,
human and mutant alike,
Dr. Hank McCoy.
Way to go, fur ball.
Morning.
Hello, Moira.
Charles.

It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood... you know.
I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider.
Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me.
Now...
- Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!
people really like me.
Hey, stick around! It's gonna start again in a couple minutes.
- Yeah... - That's OK.
The city is safe and sound.
Guess I've had something to do with that.
My uncle Ben would be proud.
I still go to school,
top of my class.
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us
that the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field.
From the form of this matrix,
we can see...?
Miss Stacey?
- That only the m=0 quantum states are affected.
Correct! Good work, Miss Stacey.
Parker.
You got something to add?
No, sir.
And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.
Hi. Um, Miss Watson left a ticket for me?
Peter Parker.
Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you.
It's my girlfriend!
Harry!
I need to talk to you.
Explain things.
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.
MJ.
Peter.
Was I good?
- Good?
You were great. You were...
- You say great?
I love my flowers. They're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.
Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.
What's with you guys anyway?
It's complicated.
Tell me again, was I really good?
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.
Your knees were fine.
- The applause was not very loud.
Yes, it was.
It's the acoustics.
It's all about diffusion.
It keeps the sound waves from grouping.
You see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it's like an...
- You are such a nerd.
Did you see that one?
You know what?
I'd like to sing on stage for the rest of my life
with you in the first row.
I'll be there.
Tell me you love me.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I always have.
You can't hide here, Flint.
I'm just here to see my daughter.
You are an escaped convict.
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.
You're nothing but a common thief.
You maybe even killed a man.
It wasn't even like that.
Wasn't.
I had good reason for what I was doing.
And that's the truth.
You and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together.
I live in a prison. It's a great truth.
And that is the truth that you left behind.
Right there in that bedrooom.
I missed you.
I missed you too, Daddy.
I promise
I'll make you healthy again.
Whatever it takes.
I'll get the money.
- You get out of here.
Now.
I'm not a bad person.
Just had bad luck.
Peter, what is it?
It's MJ...
I'm gonna ask her to marry me!
Oh, Peter! Oh!
The day that uncle Ben asked me to marry him,
he was so scared and excited.
And very young.
And I loved him so fiercely.
Then you said yes, right?
No. I wanted to say yes, but I said no.
I wasn't ready,
neither was he.
So we took our time.
Looked forward to it.
Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love.
A man has to be understanding
and put his wife before himself.
Can you do that, Peter?
Yeah. I think I can.
Then you have my blessing.
I hope you've considered a proper proposal.
Your uncle had it all planned.
He took me to the beach one Sunday.
He was a knockout in his bathing suit.
And I, I didn't look too bad myself.
We were very good swimmers.
It was a beautiful day,
and he said: "Let's swim to the island."
And at the island,
we found a perfect spot by an old tree,
and we lay down and looked up at the sky.
And then he said, "Close your eyes, May."
And I did. And then he said, "Open them."
And I did.
And he was holding this ring.
Dazzling, in front of me.
I thought it was the sun.
We'd be married 50 years
come August... if...
So.
I hope you make it very special
for Mary Jane.
Do something she'll never forget.
Give her this.
Come on.
Take it.
Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.
Listen to me! I didn't kill your father!
He was trying to kill me. He killed himself.
Shut up!
I'm still here, Peter!
Hate those things.
Harry.
Harry.
Harry!
Oh my God.
Harry!
Come on!
God!
- And clear!
No response.
- Recharge. Let's go again.
Clear!
No response.
We charge it one more time. And clear!
Captain Stacey.
What's this?
- Flint Marko, the guy we tied to the Ben Paker homicide.
What about him?
- He just broke out of Rikers.
And?
- He's on the run.
He's in the marshlands. I think we got him.
There he is!
"DANGER
PARTICLE PHYSICS TEST FACILITY
KEEP OUT"
Euton, take the west side. Tommy, take the east.
Where'd he go?
That's it. It's charged.
- Right.
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on 1.
There's a change in the silicon mass.
It's probably a bird. It'll fly away when we fire it up.
Initiating demoleculisation.
How is he?
- He's gonna be OK.
But there's been some memory impairment.
Particularly his short-term memory.
Right now, he can't remember the accident
or anything that happened to him recently.
Is it permanent?
It could be.
Only time will tell.
He's awake if you want to see him.
Uh-- maybe I should wait.
Nah, it's fine. Just keep it brief. Allow him to rest.
Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Hit my head.
Yeah.
Doctor said I was in an accident. Hit and run.
I don't remember much of anything.
My father--
he died, right?
This is all so weird.
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.
I know that face.
How are you doing?
I don't know.
Last thing I remember, I was falling...
somewhere.
You're still fine.
We love you, Harry.
It feels like
somehow I've been gone for a really long time.
Now I'm back home.
It's good to have you back.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to scoot, OK?
OK.
- All right, thank you.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, great.
I think he's gonna be fine.
Think so.
And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.
You have lovely friends.
My best friends.
I'd give my life for them.
Yeah?
- It's me.
- Oh! Hey!
You know I can't open the door.
It's stuck again?
Come on and help me.
I'm coming.
The review.
- Oh!
The hated it. They hated me.
Well, they can't hate you.
"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl.
"Easy on the eyes, but not on the ears.
"Her small voice didn't carry past the first row."
That's ridiculous. I was right there.
You were in the first row.
Yeah, but that's...
Listen. You were great.
That's a critic.
This is something you're gonna have to get used to.
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.
- This isn't about you.
It's about me.
It's about my career.
- I know, and I'm just saying,
you can't let it bring you down.
You just gotta believe in yourself.
You pull yourself together,
and you get right back on the horse.
- Don't give me the horse thing.
Try to understand how I feel.
It's just...
I look at these words,
and it's like my father wrote them.
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of 54th and 6th Ave, please report. Crane out of control. Approach with caution.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Sorry.
Oh my God.
Seven Atom to central. That crane .
It's bigger than we thought. We're gonna need a major mobilization right away.
Just gotta douse the accelerator! Now!
OK, Gwen.
I've got a secret. It's my call for ya.
What is that thing doing in my background?
Captain Stacey, the guys look out of shot of it.
They can't shut down the crane.
Get Edison on the phone.
Have them kill the power of the whole block.
Are you all right?
It's coming back!
Oh my God. It's Gwen!
What?
What's she doing up there?
I don't know. I just saw her last night. She said she had a modeling gig.
Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir.
Eddie Brock, jr.
I work at the Daily Bugle.
And I'm dating your daughter.
You OK?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Hey, Spidey, hold on. Bugle needs a photo.
Thank God you're OK.
- Daddy!
Hey. I'm the new guy.
- New guy?
From now on, I'm gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle.
So-- smile! Are you smiling?
Where's the other guy?
- Peter Parker?
Yeah, um, look, between you and me--
The guy's kind of an amateur.
Have you noticed, his stuff makes you look a little... bloated.
Just a little chunky.
- OK...
Don't have to worry about that anymore, buddy.
Dazzeling.
Just a little something the boys in the ad department and I whipped up.
As you know, circulation of the Bugle has been pretty good.
Though not as good as the New York Times
or the Daily News
or the Post or several other smaller...
- Get on with it, moron!
What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr Jameson.
Your wife told me to tell you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...
Thank you.
So, I propose this campaign:
"DAILY BUGLE" -- that's obvious.
"IT'S HIP, IT'S NOW" -- I came up with that one.
"IT'S WOW" -- that's actually Eric's.
"AND HOW!" -- that's me again.
Time to take your pill.
Not that one.
Not that one.
Drink plenty of water.
Thank you.
Continue.
He's busy.
Oh, no, I'm just here to talk to you, babe.
(- What's that smell?)
That's a little something called
"Nice 'n' Easy".
What's on you?
- It's called "Go Away".
That is the dumbest idea you've ever had. You have had some daunting...
- Blood pressure.
Hey, where are you going?
Who are you?
- You hired him last week.
Freelance.
- I did? What's that smell?
Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.
Wow, I really like that shirt.
Here. It's a crane accident. Check out the light source.
He likes my shirt.
Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete. You better get in there.
A new guy. He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.
Uh. Thanks.
Parker! You're late! Maybe too late. Bruckner here beat ya to it.
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.
- I got you this.
But he got me this.
Wait. How'd you get that? I didn't see you.
- How'd you get that high?
Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
A flagpole?
Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.
It's better.
- Cheaper, too.
Congratulations, son. We'll use your shot and pay you 50 bucks.
Uh-- all right, JJ. I'm your man.
I know more about what makes a good picture
than any photographer in this town.
See, photography, it's not just about
-- no offense -- flagpoles. Whatever.
It's about lighting. Composition. Drama.
I want a staff job, sir.
I have a girl that I intend to marry, and--
I have this stupid little dream of-- working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time.
J. Jonah Jameson.
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?
- You fired him.
- Whatever.
Wait a minute. I know what makes a good picture,
and I've been here for a long time. If there's a staff job,
Mr Jameson, I think I deserve it.
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us for years.
He's done a great job.
You want a staff job, and you want a staff job.
Anybody care about what I want?
I do.
- Shut up. Get out.
I want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is.
He's a fake. He's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.
"Spider-Man with his hand in the cookie jar".
Whoever brings me that photo gets the job.
What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go!
I'm on it, boss.
You'll never get that shot.
We'll see.
You know,
I guess one person can make a difference.
'Nuff said.
Welcome home, Harry.
Thank God you're all right.
Thanks, Bernard.
Aperitif?
- Sure.
Got you a little homecoming present.
Wha-- It's your old ball!
- Yeah.
Thanks, buddy.
We were pretty good in the backyard, weren't we?
We were terrible. And we tried out for the varsity team.
Yeah, for the cheerleaders.
- Right.
Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
I don't know.
- You don't?
Hey Bernard, do I have any girlfriends?
- Not that I know of, sir.
That's a pretty cool pass, huh?
It's OK.
Looks like I'm not worrying for money.
No.
Well, I bet I can turn this little girlfriend thing around.
You know,
he always appreciated how you helped me through high school.
I just wish I could remember more about him.
He loved you.
That's the main thing.
Hey, let's watch the game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.
- OK.
Whoa, catch that!
Did you see that?
Still got the moves.
Yeah!
Why are you stopping?
What is she doing here?
Gary, you were supposed to call her agent.
Hi, honey.
We tried to reach you.
I'm sorry.
One critic?
- No, all the papers, dear.
Mary Jane, honey. Sit down. Let's explain it to you.
- If you like, we could say you became ill.
That was so poorly handled.
- Yeah. Let's just rehearse.
All right, Spidey!
Excuse me, miss. Let me see that gorgeous smile.
Hi, Eddie.
You're so beautiful.
This is front page stuff.
I've got to practice. I'll see you later, OK?
How about tonight?
- Not tonight.
Why not?
Think of that amazing-- night that we had.
We had a coffee, Eddie.
Hey, beautiful.
One more.
Everything OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
You're not still mad at me, are you?
No, Peter. I'm proud of you.
Hey. I'm gonna be swingin' it from over there.
So you know where to look.
Give 'em a good show.
Don't worry about that review.
We're gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night.
Promise.
- Yeah.
Isn't that that guy from that prison break?
He fits.
Hey you! Halt!
Cover the back!
Fire!
People of the city of New York, I am here today
because I fell 62 storeys
and someone caught me.
Someone who never asks for anything in return.
Someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is.
Hey, MJ.
- Harry.
Where is Pete?
Um-- taking somebody's picture, I guess.
I'm so happy to see you. You look so good.
I've never felt better.
It's a weird feeling, not knowing New York.
Bump on the head, I'm just free as a bird.
Will you bump me on the head?
- Bop.
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.
You came. You sent me flowers.
I did?
I'll come again tonight.
You can't.
I--I was let go.
What happened.
I wasn't very good.
You know, this is embarrassing, but...
I once wrote you a play in high school.
You wrote me a play?
Yeah.
- Harry, that's the sweetest thing.
I ask you: When you're dropping without a parachute
or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire,
who is it that brakes your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children?
Spider-Man!
They love me!
Then let's hear it! For your one and only friendly neighborhood...
Spider-Man!
Kiss him!
Kiss him!
Go ahead, lay it right on me.
Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.
Kiss him! Kiss him!
- No, Spider-Man, no!
Right...
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.
Hey, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Jig's up, pal.
I don't want to hurt you.
Leave now.
- I guess you haven't heard?
I'm the sheriff 'round these parts.
OK.
Where do all these guys come from?
Bonsoir. Le monsieur a-t-il un "reservation"?
I'm sorry, I don't speak...
- But this is a French restaurant, non?
Oui.
Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.
Ah. Here we are.
Table for two. Pekar.
Parker.
- That is what I said.
Pekar.
Um, I have a request.
My girlfriend will be coming,
and I have this ring.
Ah. All.
Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, hein?
Yes, and I want to do something very special.
I love it.
Romance.
I am French.
When I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring...
In ze bottom of her glass?
Perfect.
- Magnifique.
Also I thought, at the same time
could the musicians
play this song?
Their favorite.
And take good care of the ring.
Ah oui, with my life, monsieur.
- S'il vous plat.
- Oui.
I like you.
Thank you.
"Bon" chance.
Bonne chance.
OK, so... How would you like some champagne?
How'd that get in there?
Aw, don't cry.
Look at you, wow! Beautiful.
- Thanks.
Is this place in your budget?
Oh, it's a special occasion.
You're on Broadway.
I don't feel like much of a star tonight.
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.
Peter, you have no idea how I feel right now.
Oh no, I know exactly how you feel.
Listen.
I have been through this.
Happens to me all the time.
I see Spider-Man posters in the window.
Kids running around with me on their sweaters.
Big Hallowe'en item.
I don't know, I guess I've become something of an icon.
Like yesterday.
They keep screaming: "Spider-Man! Spider-Man!"
I don't know, I mean,
I'm thinking to myself,
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?"
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
Hi. My parents and I are just having dinner here.
Hello.
I'm Gwen Stacey.
This is Mary Jane Watson.
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time.
Gwen is my lab partner in Dr Connor's class.
Pete's something of a genius. I'd be completely lost without him.
Which actually reminds me--
Pete, if you got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man,
could you bring it to class?
I'd really love it.
For my portfolio.
After all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?
I can't imagine.
Well, it was lovely to meet you.
Good night.
- Good night.
Uh, she's in my science class. It's not her best subject.
What?
How come you never mentioned her?
She's your lab partner,
you saved her life,
she thinks you're a genius and she had her polished fingernails all over you?
Or didn't you notice?
And she gave Spider-Man the key to the city.
I'll never forget that.
She's just a girl in my class.
- Let me ask you something.
When you kissed her,
who was kissing her?
Spider-Man or Peter?
What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.
That was our kiss.
Why would you do that?
You must have known how it made me feel.
Do you want to push me away?
Push you away?
Why would I want to push you away? I love you.
You're my girlfriend. She's a girl in my class, MJ.
I don't feel very well. I'm sorry. I have to go.
Where are you going?
- Please don't follow me.
Here we are.
Hi, it's MJ. Sing a song at the beep. Beep!
Hello. Uh...
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on.
I don't know if you got the messages, or what.
But...
I just want to talk to you.
OK. Call me, all right?
Hallo?
- Mr Parker?
Yeah?
- This is Detective Neil Garettfrom the 2nd precinct.
I'm calling on behalf of Captain Stacey.
He would like you to come down to the station to speak with him.
Originally we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine,
was your husband's killer.
We were wrong.
What?
- Turns out Mr Carradine was only an accomplice.
The actual killer is still at large.
What are you talking about?
This is the man who killed your husband.
His name is Flint Marko.
He's a small-time crook who's been in and out of prison.
You got this wrong.
Two days ago, he escaped.
Evidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate.
And we have a couple of witnesses who corroborate the story.
No, wait, sir. You don't want to do this.
Get in! What are you doing?
Would you put these photos away, please?
I'm sorry, Mrs Parker. I know this isn't easy,
but please be patient with us.
We're doing our job. We will catch him.
No, you're not doing your job.
I watched my uncle die.
We chased down the wrong man.
Now you're telling me there's suspicions for two years? Witnesses?
Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down, sir.
No, I have no intention of settling down!
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!
L-20 Parkway, all officers in the vicinity please report.
We have an abandoned vehicle and an abandoned man in the middle of the street.
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.
Peter, it's MJ.
I'm not here about what happened at dinner. Just please open up.
Aunt May called me. She told me about what happened.
She's worried about you.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be. I'm fine.
I don't want you to do something stupid.
Like try to find my uncle's killer?
And do something you'll regret.
Like...
with that other guy.
He had a gun on me.
I made a move, and he fell. I told you that.
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
C-22, auto at 566, 9th Avenue...
- Will you turn that thing off?
Peter, I'm here because I care about you.
And I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty, but--
I want to be here for you.
- OK.
I get it. Thank you.
But, uh, I'm fine.
I don't need your help.
Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter.
Even Spider-Man.
90 - X-ray - 98.
10-31 at 642, Madison Av...
1-3-Tom has responded 10-20 at 540, East 107...
male inside apartment B on first floor...
310-11 of a residence, 738...
Don't hurt me! Just give me a chance!
- What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?
Did you?
Where am I?
What is this?
I feel...
Wow.
This feels good.
This is something else.
What do you think?
I've never seen anything like it.
I'm a physicist, not a biologist, but...
I'll look at it in the morning, run some tests.
- Can we do that now?
It seems to like you.
Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?
It has the characteristics of a symbiote,
which needs to bond to a host to survive.
And sometimes, these things in nature, when they bind,
they can be hard to unbind.
Bank robbery in progress, First Eastern Bank Bismarck.
Another sand storm is reported in the vicinity. All cars, proceed with caution.
Marko.
Buddy, love the new outfit.
This is exactly what I need to scoop, partner. Give me some of that web action.
See you, chum.
What the hell?
Flint Marko?
What do you want from me?
Remember Ben Parker?
The old man you shot down in cold blood?
What does it matter to you anyway?
Everything!
It's time to pay, Marko.
Good riddance.
Re-ent!
Not now.
This is a free country. It's not a rent-free country.
Leave me alone.
Give me rent.
You'll get your rent when you fix this damn door!
That wasn't cool.
He is good boy.
He must be in some kind of trouble.
Flint Marko, the man who killed uncle Ben--
he was killed last night.
O my--
What happened?
Spider-Man killed him.
Spider-Man?
I don't understand.
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.
What happened?
I... He was...
I thought that you'd feel...
He deserved it, didn't he?
I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die.
Aunt May, he killed uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.
But he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts.
It's like a poison.
It can take you over.
Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.
Hello.
Hey, Harry, it's MJ.
Hi.
- I need some company.
Are you doing anything? Can I stop by?
Yeah, sure. Come on over.
OK. Are you sure it's OK?
I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.
OK, I'll see you soon.
Great.
- Bye.
Bernard?
- Yes, Mr Osborn?
We're having a guest. Can you get some food?
A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.
A guest guest?
Will you just get some food?
Rightaway, sir.
Hey, Mr Ditkovitch.
An orange?
No, thanks.
Listen--
I'm really sorry for what happened earlier.
I shouldn't have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about.
Ah, it's not big deal.
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza some time.
Today's good.
OK.
Have problem with the phone?
No, no, I was just-- was trying to figure out what to say.
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say: "You're a good woman,
"I'm good man."
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
He's calling a woman.
- Are you calling Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...
- It's none of your business.
Go! Go.
Give her a call.
- Thanks.
Bye.
- Bye.
You hungry?
Yeah.
Come in.
Hope you like peppers.
I love 'em.
Oh, the butter!
Well, we can use that part.
"You've been dreaming."
"Nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night."
All right.
- When did you write that?
- It's intense.
So, do you want the part?
I'd love to be in your play.
- Cheers.
You know, there's not even a scar.
Barely.
Sorry.
- Me too.
I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's OK. Please.
Forgive me.
Mary Jane.
Mary Jane.
Mary Jane, please!
- I'm sorry.
You've taken your eye off the ball.
What have you done?
Avenge me!
My father-- he died, right?
Yeah.
Just wish that I could remember more about him.
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.
I swear on my father's grave: Spider-Man will pay.
Harry.
Remember me?
Yes, father.
I remember.
I was right about her,
about Peter,
about everything.
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer. Make him wish he were dead.
First we attack his heart.
Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep.
Hey, MJ.
It's Peter.
I want to talk to you about last night.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I know you were just there to help, and--
I, uh-- I don't know, I want to see you.
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.
Yeah?
- It's Ursula.
Come in.
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
There's a phone call for you.
It's Mary Jane, she called back!
Really?
- Yeah!
I put the phone on top of the thing.
Thanks. OK.
Hey.
- Hi.
I was so glad you called.
I've been-- trying to--
- Can you meet me?
You bet.
- Now?
OK. Where?
At the bridge, in the park.
On my way.
Hey. I love you.
You look beautiful.
Peonies.
You OK?
No.
There's something I have to tell you, Pete.
- OK.
It's not working.
You and me.
What?
I don't want to see you anymore.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
I'm lonely.
You aren't there for me.
I can't do this.
It's over.
- No. Please.
Please don't say that.
I know, I've been selfish.
But I can do better. I can change.
- It's not that simple.
We love each other! I love you!
And we have problems. When people have problems, they work it out.
They talk to each other.
Look, you see?
You know what this is?
You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.
I've fallen in love with someone else.
She says that she's lonely,
and that I'm not there for her.
There's another guy.
How are you holding up?
Not good.
Harry, I was going to propose to her.
Really?
She's been going through a tough time lately.
Career.
I mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club--
that's not exactly what she had in mind for herself.
A singing waitress? What are you talking about?
She was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?
She was fired?
She was fired and she told you?
She didn't tell me?
That's why I asked you here, Pete.
I'm the other guy.
What?
Look, she came to me one afternoon, troubled.
She needed someone, and I was there for her.
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.
It just...
started.
I don't believe this.
I don't believe you.
I'm really sorry.
I just thought you should know.
Can I warm you up?
Yes, please.
How's the pie?
So good.
Would you like a drink?
I'm sorry.
What was I thinking? Bad for the public image, right, Mr Key-to-the-city?
What did you do to her?
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.
Mary Jane and I, we understand each other.
She doesn't know what you are.
Peter. She knows me very well.
And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.
That taste.
Strawberries.
How d'ya like that, Spidey?
That all you got?
Stinks, doesn't it?
I protected you in high school. Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.
You gonna kill me like you killed my father?
I'm done trying to convince you.
You took him from me.
He loved me.
No:
he despised you.
You were an embarrassment for him.
Look at that little Goblin junior.
Gonna cry?
"THIEF! Spider-Man shows his true colors"
- Spider-Man used to make me feel safe.
Now I'm afraid to walk home from work.
My son thought the world of this guy.
I have a 9 year old daughter, loves Spider-Man.
Who's she supposed to look up to now?
This is the guy they gave the key to the city to?
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.
Cheers! New staff photographer!
- I just got lucky.
This is so wonderful for you.
Well, you might wanna tell JJ to make a little more wall space.
Good morning.
- It's a beautiful day, huh?
What was it you said, I'll never get that picture?
There's your hero.
I never thought he'd really do that.
See? Right there,
you made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.
It's funny you should say that,
'cause I was looking through some old photos, and
looks very, uh-- similar.
OK-- Well, I gotta get back to work.
You're trash, Brock.
Excuse me?
Your picture is a fake.
Parker, you are such a boy scout.
When are you gonna give a guy a break?
You want forgiveness?
Get religion.
What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?
Yeah, no, we're just horsin' around.
Look, I'm begging you. If you do this,
I will lose everything.
There's not a paper in town that will hire me.
You should've thought of that earlier.
What are you doing, Peter?
Show this to the editor. Tell him to check his source next time.
It's a fake!
Empire State Photographic Department confirms it.
Pack your things. Get out of my building.
I was just...
- You're fired!
You know we're gonna have to print a retraction now.
Haven't printed a retraction in 20 years!
"SORRY SPIDEY
Bugle drops charges"
Shalom?
- Mr Parker?
Dr Connors here.
- Oh, Dr Connors!
How are you?
Quite a specimen you left me, Parker.
Its chemistry is not unlike the meteorites of the 70s.
Thanks. It's good.
You know what, Parker?
Parker?
Give me some milk.
It amplifies characteristics of its host.
Hey, give me another cookie.
Specially aggression.
This can be dangerous.
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?
You got any with nuts?
Um-- I have some nuts, I could make some.
Go make me some.
Peter?
- No, no. Of course not.
Your shots are so good.
I'd love to shoot you sometime.
Peter Parker! Peter...
Parker!
Miss Brent, that's not the position I hired you for!
Black suit Spider-Man!
Peter, these are incredible!
We gotta have these, Jonah.
I'll pay you the usual rate.
If you want the shots, I'll take the staff job. Double the money.
You are really gonna dig this joint.
Do you think I'm dressed all right?
Too fancy or...
You're looking fine, babe.
Thank you.
Love that little giggle.
Oh, this is so cool!
I have never been to a jazz club before.
I hope we can get a table.
Find us some shade.
Thanks, .
Right this way, sir.
"RESERVED"
Thank you.
I'm so loving this.
- Oh, me too.
Isn't that your old girlfriend?
Yeah.
Do you want to go someplace else?
No, no. I'll be OK.
Mary Jane, show us what you got.
I'll be right back.
- Right.
Peter?
This is for you.
Double time!
Thanks.
Now dig all this.
That was all for her?
I'm so sorry.
You all right, Mary Jane?
I'm fine.
- OK.
Hey.
What's wrong with you?
You.
Can I help you, sir?
No.
- Is everything OK here, Paul?
Yeah, is everything OK here, Paul?
Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.
Take your hand offa me. Now.
Peter, stop!
Who are you?
I don't know.
It's Brock, Sir.
Edward Brock junior.
I come before you today
humbled
and humiliated
to ask you for one thing.
I want you to kill Peter Parker.
Parker?
Hi, Peter.
- Hi.
You don't seem to have changed the room around very much.
Of course, there's not much you can do,
is there?
When we spoke on the phone,
I sensed something was bothering you,
so I thought I'd just come by.
How's Mary Jane?
I don't know.
I never heard from you.
Did you ever propose?
You said
a husband's gotta put a wife before himself.
I'm not ready.
But what happened?
You seemed so sure.
Yeah. I...
I heard her, aunt May.
I don't know what to do.
You start by doing the hardest thing.
You forgive yourself.
I believe in you, Peter.
You're a good person.
And I know you will find a way to put it right.
In time.
I don't like Spider-Man.
I want him dead too, Flint.
That's why I've been looking for you.
Oh yeah. I know all about you.
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.
It's just-- It doesn't seem right to me.
Look.
I wanna kill the Spider.
You wanna kill the Spider.
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.
Interested?
Yeah.
So--
where to?
"BREAKING NEWS: City in crisis"
- All New York is holding its breath
as a hostage crisis continues to unfold.
Just thirty minutes ago, police came across this startling sight:
A young woman held hostage in a taxi
suspended 80 storeys above the ground
in what appears to be a giant web.
Every attempt by the police to rescue the hostage
has been flaunted by the Sandman.
Compounding the danger is the appearance of a strange black-suited figure.
Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man. But he is now been identified
as something entirely different.
The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson,
an actrice recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway.
We're now going to take you live to the scene with Jennifer Dugan.
Jennifer?
- We're only about 100 feet away now, Hal, and--
Wait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web.
It seems to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering.
"SPIDER-MAN, STOP US IF YOU CAN"
Apparently, Spider-Man is being challenged to some sort of confrontation.
And that raises serious questions about what kind of chance he'd stand
against such overwhelming...
Harry.
I need your help.
Can't take them both. Not by myself.
You don't deserve my help.
Harry,
she needs us.
Get out.
If I may, Sir.
I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.
What are you trying to tell me?
The night your father died
I cleaned his wound.
The blade that pierced his body
came from his glider.
I know
you're trying to defend your father's honor,
but there's no question
that he died by his own hand.
I loved your father.
As I have loved you, Harry.
As your friends love you.
Look!
He seems to have come out of nowhere to answer the prayers of the city,
just when all hope seemed to be lost.
Peter?
They're gonna kill us both.
I'm gonna get you out of this.
Watch out!
Hey, Parker.
My God. Eddie?
Oh, my spider-sense is tickling.
If you know what I'm talking about.
We can find a way to settle this.
You're so right.
I'm thinking-- humiliation.
Kinda like you humiliated me.
Do you remember?
Do you remember what you did to me?
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.
How's that sound, tiger?
Hold on, Mary Jane!
Mary Jane.
It's hard to believe what's happening.
The brutality of it.
I don't know how he can take any more.
This can be a tragic day
for the people of New York.
It could be the end of Spider-Man.
Awesome!
- Wicked cool!
You came.
Looks like just in the nick of time.
A couple of minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either.
What're you gonna do.
I'm needing some help over here.
I'm a little busy right now.
Give me your hand!
Parker!
Parker, where...
I need a photographer!
Hey, kid. You want a job?
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.
All right, how much for the camera?
One hundred bucks.
- A hundred bucks?
All right, you little prick. Here.
Film's extra.
Gotcha.
Pete, watch out!
You still got any more?
- Hang on!
To what?
Go, buddy!
- Got her!
You OK?
Yeah.
Good.
Hey, Pete.
Am I interrupting?
Never wound
what you can't kill.
Eddie-- this suit-- you gotta take it off!
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
I know what it feels like.
It feels good.
The power. Everything.
But you'll lose yourself.
Let it go.
I like being bad.
It makes me happy.
Harry!
Peter, what are you doing?
No!
Eddie!
Harry?
- Mary Jane.
I'm going to get help.
Stay.
I didn't want this.
But I had no choice.
We always have a choice.
You had a choice when you killed my uncle.
My daughter was dying.
I needed money.
I was scared.
I told your uncle all I wanted was the car.
What is it?
- I need your car.
He said to me:
"Why don't you just put down the gun and go home?"
I realize now he was just trying to help me.
Then I saw my partner running over with the cash,
and the gun was in my hand.
Did a terrible thing to you.
I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back.
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I just want you to understand.
I've done terrible things too.
You didn't choose to be this.
The only thing left to me now
is my daughter.
I forgive you.
Hey, pal. How are you doing?
Been better.
We'll get you through this.
No.
You should never forgive...
...said those things.
None of that matters, Peter.
You're my friend.
Best friend.
Whatever comes our way.
Whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice.
My friend Harry taught me that.
He chose to be the best of himself.
It's the choices that make us who we are,
and we can always choose to do what's right.
I'm through with love
I'll never fall again
Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you
Or no one
And so I'm through with love
I've locked my heart
I'll keep my feelings there
I have stocked my heart
With icy frigid air
And I mean to care
For no one...

I feel like you're driving me to
court martial. This is crazy.
What did I do? I feel like you're
gonna pull over and snuff me.
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forest...
- We can talk, sir.
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
No, you intimidate them.
Dear God, you're a woman!
I honestly, I couldn't have called that.
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?
I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.
Well you have actually excellent
bone structure there. I'm kinda...
having a hard time not looking
at you now. Is that weird?
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.
It is true you went 12-for-12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no. March and I
had a scheduling conflict,
but fortunately the Christmas
cover was twins. Anything else?
You're kidding me
with a hand up, right?
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?
Yes, it's very cool.
I don't wanna see this
on your MySpace page.
Please, no gang signs.
No, throw it up, I'm kidding.
Yeah, peace! I love peace.
I'd be outta job with peace.
C'mon! Just click it, don't change
the settings, just click it.
What's going on?
Jimmy, stay with Stark!
Lie down!
Son of a bitch!
- Wait, wait, give me a gun!
- Stay here!
Tony Stark.
LAS VEGAS, 36 HOURS EARLIER
Visionary. Genius.
American patriot.
Even from an early age,
the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.
At age four, he built
his first circuit board.
At age six, his first engine.
And at seventeen, he graduated
Summa Cum Laude from MIT.
Then, the passing of a titan.
Howard Stark's life long friend
and ally Obadiah Stane,
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder.
Untill at age 21,
the prodigal son returns,
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.
With the keys to the kingdom,
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics,
satellite targeting.
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry,
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America and
her interests around the globe.
As liaison to Stark Industries,
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.
He is my friend and
he is my great mentor.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark!
Tony?
Thank you, Colonel.
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
This is wonderful.
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.
But if I were Tony...
...I would tell you
how honored I feel,
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.
Tony, you know,
the best thing about Tony...
...is also the worst thing -
he's always working.
C'mon!
We should just stay
till the morning.
- You are unbelievable!
- Oh, no. They roped you into this?
Nobody roped me into anything.
But they told me...
that if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you!
That's great. So when do we do it?
One more round. - There you go.
There it is. That was easy.
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK.
Wow, would you look at that?
That's... that's something else.
I don't have any of those
swooping around. All right, ride!
Give me a hand, will you?
OK, you too.
I don't blow on man's hands.
There it is! It's the Lieutenant
Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened,
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?
- This is where I exit.
- Tomorrow don't be late.
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know.
Render unto Caesar that which
is Caesar's. There you go.
Mr. Stark! Excuse me!
Mr. Stark!
Christine Everheart,
Vanity Fair magazine.
Can I ask you a couple of
questions? - She's cute.
- She's alright? Hi.
- Hi.
Yeah. Okay, go.
You've been called the Da Vinci of
our time. What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't paint.
And what do you say to your other
nickname, the Merchant of Death?
That's not bad.
Let me guess... Berkeley?
Brown, actually.
Well, Ms. Brown.
It's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.
I guarantee you the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,
we'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.
Rehearse that much?
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand.
All I want is the serious answer.
Okay, here is serious.
My old man had a philosophy:
"Peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy."
That's a great line, coming
from a guy selling the sticks.
My father helped defeat Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,
would call that being a hero.
And a lot of people would
also call that war-profiteering.
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved by
advancing medical technology?
Or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?
All those breakthroughs:
military funding, honey.
Wow, did you ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.
Good morning. It's 7 a.m.
The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.
The surf conditions are fair
with waist to sholder highlines,
high tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA
Tony? Hey, Tony!
You are not authorized to
access this area. - Jesus!
That's Jarvis, he runs the house.
I've got your clothes here, they've
been dry cleaned and pressed.
And there's a car
waiting for you outside
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.
You must be the famous
Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry cleaning?
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires.
Including occasionally taking out
the trash. Would that be all?
Give me the exploded view.
The compression in cylinder 3
appears to be low.
Note that.
- I'll try again later...
- Please don't turn down my music.
I'll keep you posted.
You are supposed to be half way
around the world right now.
- How did she take it?
- Like a champ.
Might've tried to
hustle me out of here.
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.
That's funny... I thought with
it being my plane and all,
that it would just wait
for me to get there.
I need to speak to you about couple of
things before I get you outta the door.
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the
purpose of having your own plane
if it departs before you arrive?
Larry called, he's got another
buyer for the Jackson Pollock
in the wings, do you
want it, yes or no?
Is it a good representation
of his Spring Period?
No the "Springs" is actually the
neighborhood in East Hampton,
where he lived and worked,
not "spring" like the season.
I think it's a fair example...
I think it's incredibly overpriced.
I need it. Buy it, store it.
Okay... the MI commencement speech.
Is in June... please, don't
harange me about that stuff.
Well, they are haragning me,
so I'm gonna say yes...
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.
It's your birthday. - Yes.
- I knew that. Already?
Yeah, isn't that strange,
it's the same day as last year.
Well, get yourself something
nice from me. - I already did.
- And?
- Oh, it was very nice.
Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
You're welcome, Ms. Potts.
You're good! I thought
I've lost you back there.
You did, sir.
I took it across Mojave.
- Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
What's wrong with you?
- What?
Three hours! - I got caught
doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
Three hours. For three hours,
you got me standing here.
I'm waiting on you now.
Lets go. C'mon.
Wheels up! Rock and roll!
What're you reading?
- Nothing.
C'mon, sourpatch,
don't be mad.
I told you I'm not mad,
I'm indifferent, okay?
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.
- No need to apologize.
- I told him I was sorry but he...
I'm just indifferent right now.
You don't respect yourself,
so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.
- I'm just your babysitter,
and so, when you need your
diaper changed, thank you...
let me know and I'll
get you a bottle, okay?
Hey, heat up the sake, will you?
Thanks for reminding me.
I'm not talking... we're not drinking,
we're working right now.
And you are constitutionally
incapable of being responsible.
It would be irresponsible
not to drink.
I'm just talking about
the night cup. - Hot sake?
- Yes, two please.
- No, just...
I'm not drinking,
I don't want any.
That's what I'm talking about.
When I get up in the morning,
and I'm putting on my uniform,
you know what I recognize?
I see in that mirror that every
person that's got this uniform
will get my back! - Here we
go again. I'm not like you.
No, you don't have to be like me.
But you're more than... yes you are.
Will you excuse me,
I'm a little bit distracted here.
No, you can't be distracted
right now. Listen to me!
BAGRAM AIR BASE,
AFGHANISTAN
General.
Welcome, Mr. Stark.
We look forward to your
weapons presentation.
Is it better to be feared
or respected?
And I say, is it too much
to ask for both?
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel
of Stark Industries freedom line.
It's the first missile system
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.
They say the best weapon is
one you never have to fire.
I respectfully disagree.
I prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.
That's how dad did it,
that's how America does it...
and it's worked out
pretty well so far.
Find an excuse to let
one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.
For your consideration,
the Jericho.
We throw one of these in with every
purchase of 500 million or more.
To peace!
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How did it go?
Went great, looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.
Hey, way to go, my boy.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
Why aren't you wearing
those pyjamas I got you?
Good night, Tony.
Hey Tony!
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee.
The hum-drum-vee is back there.
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
What the hell did you do to me?
What I did?
What I did is to save your life.
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.
Here, wanna see?
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.
We call them the walking dead.
Because in takes about a week for
the balls to reach the vital organs.
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet.
Hooked up to a car battery.
And it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.
That's right. Smile!
We met once, you know.
At the technical
conference in Bern.
- Don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.
Where are we?
Come on, stand up.
Stand up.
Do as I do.
C'mon, put your hands up.
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer
in the history of America."
He is honored.
He wants you to build a missile.
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.
This one.
I refuse.
Tony!
He wants to know
what you think.
I think he got a lot
of my weapons.
He says they have everything you
need to build a Jericho missile.
He wants you to make
the list of materials.
He says for you to start
working immediately,
and when you're done,
he will set you free.
No, I won't.
No, he won't.
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.
But they will never find
you in these mountains.
Look...
What you just saw...
that is your legacy, Stark.
Your life's work in the
hands of those murderers.
Is that how you want to go out?
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?
Or are you going to do
something about it?
Why should I do anything?
They're gonna kill me, you...
Either way, if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.
Well then... this is a very
important week for you, isn't it?
If this is gonna be my workstation,
I want it well lit,
I want all of these tools.
Welding gear, I don't care if it's
acetylene or propane.
I need a soldering station,
I need helmets,
I need goggles,
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets
of precision tools.
How many languages do you speak?
A lot. But apparently
not enough for this place.
They speak arabic,
urdu, dari, pashto,
mongolian, farsi, russian.
Who are these people?
They are your loyal
customers, sir.
They call themselves
The Ten Rings.
You know, we might
be more productive
if you include me in the
planning proces? - Aha.
Okay. We don't need this.
What is that?
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.
We need at least 1.6,
so why don't you go break
down the other eleven.
What are they doing?
Working.
Careful. Careful, we only
get one shot at this.
Relax, I've steady hands.
Why do you think
you're still alive, huh?
What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.
- Yinsen... nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Wow, that doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.
That's because it is a
miniaturized Arc reactor.
We got a big one powering
my factory at home.
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.
But what could it generate?
If my math is right,
and it always is...
three gigajoules per second.
That could run your heart
for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah.
Or something big for 50 minutes.
This is our ticket outta here.
- What is it?
'Flying the mountain' look.
Impressive.
Shesh Besh.
Good roll.
Good roll.
You still didn't tell me
where you're from.
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.
It's actually a nice place.
- You got a family?
- Yes.
And I will see them
when I leave here.
And you, Stark?
Nothing.
No.
So you're a man who has
everything... and nothing.
Doesn't look anything
like the photo.
Maybe he modified it.
- The tail doesn't seem right.
- Well, too bad.
Relax.
The bow and arrow once was the
pinacle of weapons technology.
It allowed the great Genghis Khan
to rule from the Pacific
to the Ukraine.
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great.
And four times the size
of the Roman empire.
But today,
whoever holds the latest
Stark weapons,
rules these lands.
And soon...
...it will be my turn.
Why did you fail me?
We're working on it.
Diligently.
I spared your life.
Is this how you repay me?
It's very complex.
We're trying hard.
On your knees.
You think I'm an idiot?
Tell me the truth.
We are working hard.
Open your mouth.
- What does he want?
- You think I'm a fool?
What is going on?
Tell me the truth.
We are working on Jericho.
What do you want,
a delivery date?
I need him.
He's a good assistant.
You have till tomorrow...
...to assemble my missile.
- Okay?
- Yes.
Can you move?
Say it again.
then 16 steps, left from
the door, four to the right.
Where is Stark?
He was here a moment ago.
Go find him!
Yinsen!
Yinsen!
Stark!
Say something.
He is speaking hungarian,
I don't...
- Speak hungarian.
- Okay...
What do you know?
- How did that work?
- Oh my goodness.
- It worked all right.
- What do I do?
- Let me finish this.
- Finish last powering sequence.
Okay.
Now! Tell me, tell me!
F 11. Tell me when you
see a progress bar.
It should be up right now.
Talk to me, tell me when
you see it. - I have it.
- Press Ctrl + I.
- Got it.
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over
here and button me up.
They are coming!
Doesn't need to look pretty,
just get it done.
They are coming.
Make sure that checkpoints are
clear before you follow me out, OK?
We need more time.
Okay.
I'm gonna go
buy you some time.
Stick to the plan!
Stick to the plan!
Yinsen!
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!
Stark.
Come on. We gotta go.
Move with me. C'mon, we got
a plan, we need to stick to it.
This was always the plan, Stark.
Come on, you're going to
go see your family again.
My family is dead.
I'm going to see them now, Stark.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I want this.
I want this.
Thank you for saving me.
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.
My turn.
Not bad.
How was the fun-vee?
Next time you ride with me, okay?
Watch it coming up here.
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.
Your eyes are red.
Few tears for your
long lost boss?
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.
Yeah, vacation's over.
Where to, sir?
Take us to the hospital, please.
- No. - No? Tony...
- You have to go to the hospital.
- I don't have to do anything.
I was in captivity for three months.
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger...
...and the other one...
- That's not going to happen.
It's not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.
Call for a press conference?
What on earth for?
Yeah, Hogan, drive.
Cheeseburger first.
Look at this!
Tony!
I thought you'll be
in a hospital.
Look at you!
Oh, burger, you had
to have a burger.
Did you get me one of those?
There was only one left,
I needed it.
Hey, look who's here!
- Ms. Potts?
- Yes.
May I speak with you
for a moment?
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.
I am not a reporter.
I'm agent Phil Coulson,
with the Strategic
Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.
We've been approached
already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...
We are a separate division.
With a more specific focus.
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.
- I'll put something in a book,
shell I? - Thank you.
Hey, would it be alright
if everyone sat down?
Will you sit down? That way
you can see me, and I can...
A little less formal...
What's up with the lovin'?
Don't look at me,
I don't know what he's up to.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
I never got to say
goodbye to dad.
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.
There's questions that
I would've asked him.
I would've asked him how he felt
about what his company did...
...if he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.
Or maybe he was every inch of a man
we all remember from the newsreels.
I saw young Americans killed...
...by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.
And I saw that I had
become part of a system
that is comfortable with
zero-accountability.
What happened over there?
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that
I have more to offer
this world than just making
things that blow up.
And that is why, effective
immediately, I'm shutting down
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International...
...untill such a time,
as I can decide
what the future of
this company will be,
what direction it should take,
the one I'm comfortable with,
and is consistant with the highest
good of this country and the world.
What we should
take away from this...
...is that Tony's back!
And he's healthier than ever.
We are gonna have a little
internal discussion
and we'll get back to
you with a follow-up.
- Where is he?
- He's inside.
That... that went well.
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?
Your head?
What about my head?
What do you think the over-under
on a stock drop is gonna be?
- Optimistically? 40 Points?
- At minimum.
Tony, we're a
weapons manufacturer.
Obie, I just... I don't want
the body count to be up...
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers, we make weapons.
My name is on facade
of the building.
What we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.
Not based on what I saw.
We're not doing a
good enough job.
We can do better, we're
gonna do something else.
Oh, like what? You want us
to make baby bottles?
I think we should take another
look into Arc Reactor technology.
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!
Tony, c'mon! We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.
The Arc was never cost-effective.
We knew that before we built it.
Arc Reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?
- Maybe.
- Am I right?
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that, in what... 30 years.
That's what they say.
Could you have a
lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?
- Never mind who told me.
- Show me.
- Rhodey or Pepper.
- I wanna see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.
It works.
Listen to me, Tony.
We are a team,
do you understand?
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,
like your father and I.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a
heads up, okay? But if I had...
Tony, no more of this
'ready - fire - aim' business.
- Do you understand me?
- That was dad's line.
You gotta let me handle this.
We're gonna have to play whole
different kind of ball now.
We're gonna have to
take a lot of heat.
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.
Stark Industries. I've got one
recommendation. Ready, ready?
Sell, sell, sell!
Abandon ship!
Does the'Hindenburg'
ring any bells?
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!
Pepper!
How big are your hands?
- What?
- How big are your hands?
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.
Hey!
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.
Let's see them.
Oh, wow, they are small.
Very petite, indeed.
I just need your
help for a sec.
Oh my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?
It was, it is now an antique.
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.
I was swapping it up
for an upgraded unit
and I just ran into a
little... speed bump.
Speed bump?
What's happening?
It's nothing,
it's just a little snag.
There's an exposed wire
under this device
and is contacting a socket wall
and is causing a little
bit of a short circuit.
What do you want me to do?
Put that on the table over
there. That is irrelevant.
I just want you to reach in...
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.
It's just like an operation,
you just don't let it
touch the socket wall.
- What's Operation?
- It's just a game, never mind.
- Just gently lift the wire.
- Okay. - Okay? Great.
You know, I don't think
that I am qualified to do this.
No, no, you're fine.
You're the most capable,
qualified and trustworthy
person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
Cause I really need your help here.
- Oh, there's pus!
- It's not pus.
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from
the device, not from my body.
- It smells!
- Yeah, it does.
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?
- I got it.
Now don't let it touch...
...the sides, that's what I was
trying to tell you before.
Okay, now make sure that
when you pull it out,
you don't pull out the magnet
and the end of it. That was it...
...that you just pulled out.
- Oh God. OK, what do I do?
- Don't put it back in!
- What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac
arrest cause you yanked out...
- What? I thought you said this
was safe! - We gotta hurry.
Take this, you gotta switch,
real quick. - Okay, okay.
Tony, it's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna make this okay.
You gotta touch
that to base plate.
And make sure you...
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?
I got it, I got it.
Nice.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.
Are you okay?
Don't ever, ever...
...ever ask me to do anything
like that ever again.
I don't have anyone but you.
Are we ready?
What do you want me
to do with this?
That? Destroy it.
Incinerate it.
You don't wanna keep it?
Pepper, I've been
called many things.
Nostalgic is not one of them.
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That would be all, Ms. Potts.
Hey butterfingers, come here.
What's all this stuff doing
on top of my desk?
That's my phone, that's
a picture of me and my dad...
Right there. In garbage.
All that stuff.
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?
I tell you, in my experience,
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,
his insight - that ability
to look into a situation
beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome.
Or pilot's judgement.
Colonel, it's... why not
a pilot without a plane?
Look who fell outta the sky!
Mr. Tony Stark.
Speaking about manned
or unmanned,
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong.
It's spring break,
just remember that.
Spring break 1987, that lovely
lady, what was his name?
Was it Ivan?
Don't do that, they'll believe it.
Don't do that.
Give us a couple
of minutes, you guys.
- I'm surprised.
- Why?
I swear I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.
I'm doing a little
better than walking.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Rhodey, I'm working
on something big.
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be part of it.
You're about to make a whole lotta
people around here real happy,
cause that little stunt at the
press conference, that was juicy.
This is not for the military.
I'm not... it's different.
What, are you humanitarian
now or something?
I need you to listen to me.
No, what you need is time
to get your mind right.
I'm serious.
It was nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks.
- Jarvis, are you up?
- For you sir, always.
I'd like to open a new
project file, index as: Mark 2.
Shell I store this on the Stark
Industries' central database?
I don't know who to trust
right now. Till further notice,
why don't we just keep everything
on my private server.
Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.
Maybe in mine it could
actually do some good.
Next.
Up.
Not the boot, Dummy, right here.
You got me?
Stay put. Nice.
And you, you're no better
at it at all. Lift... I got it.
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?
Up.
That's great, don't even move.
You... are a tragedy.
Okay, lets do this right.
Start mark, half meter
back of the center.
Dummy, look for light.
Stand back for fire safety.
You, roll it.
Activate hand controls.
We are gonna start up
nice and easy,
raising 10% thrust capacity
to achieve lift.
And 3, 2, 1.
Up two? Alright, step back.
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?
Yeah, everything's... what?
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great, I'll be right up.
I thought you said you were
done making weapons?
It isn't. This is
a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
How'd it go?
Oh, went that bad huh?
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York
doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
It would've gone better
if you were there.
You told me to lay low and
that's what I've been doing.
I lay low and you
take care of all the...
Hey, c'mon.
In public, the press...
This was a Board of
Directors meeting.
This was a Board of
Directors meeting?
The Board is claiming
a Post Traumatic Stress.
They are filing an injunction.
- A what?
They wanna lock you out.
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points?
We knew this was gonna happen.
- 56 and a half.
- It doesn't matter.
We own a controlling
interest in the company.
Tony, the Board has rights too.
They are making the case that
you and your new direction
isn't in a company's
best interest.
I'm being responsible.
That's a new direction.
For me... for the company.
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...
- Oh, this is great!
- Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!
- I'll be in the shop.
- Hey, hey, Tony, listen.
I'm trying to turn
this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.
Something to pitch them.
Let me have the engineers
analyze that, you know,
draw some specs.
- No.
No. Absolutely not.
This one stays with me.
That's it Obie.
Forget it.
Alright, well this
stays with me then.
Go on, here, you can have
a piece. Take two. - Thank you.
Do you mind if I come down there
to see what you're doing?
Good night, Obie.
Day 11, Test 37,
Configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.
Alright, nice and easy.
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.
And 3, 2, 1.
Please don't follow me around
with it either cause I feel
like I'm going to catch on fire
spontaneously. Just stand down.
If something happens,
then come in.
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%.
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be.
Not the car,
not the car.
It could be worse.
We are fine.
Okay, we are getting there.
Yeah. I can fly.
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.
Engage head up display.
Check.
Import all preferences
from home interface.
Will do, sir.
Alright, what do you say?
I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.
Start the virtual walkaround.
Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.
- Do a check on control surfaces.
- As you wish.
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.
Ah, yes... tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.
Start listening
the ground control.
Sir, there are still terabytes
of calculations needed
before an actual flight.
- Jarvis...
Sometimes you gotta run
before you can walk.
Ready? And 3, 2, 1.
It feels like a dream.
Alright, lets see what
this thing can do.
What's the SR-71's record?
The altitude record for fixed-wing
flight is 85.000 feet, sir.
Records are made
to be broken. C'mon!
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
build-up of ice occuring.
Keep going!
Higher!
We're iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps.
Jarvis?
C'mon, we gotta break the ice!
Cut power.
Note: main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.
The whole pressurization
is problematic.
I'm thinking 'icy' is
a probable factor.
A very astute observation, sir.
Perhaps if you intend to visit
other planets, we should
improve the exo systems.
Connect to the Cisco, have it
reconfigure the shell metals.
Use the gold-titanium alloy from
the Seraphim tactical satellite.
That should ensure
the fuselage integrity
while maintaining power
-to-weight ratio. Got it?
Yes. Shall I render using
proposed specifications?
Thrill me.
Tonight's red hot,
red carpeted,
right here at the
Disney Concert Hall,
where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit for
the Firefighters Family Fund
has become the place to be...
Jarvis, did we get
an invite from them?
I have no record of
the invitation, sir.
...haven't been seen in public
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.
Some claim he's suffering
from PTS and has been
bed ridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.
The render is complete.
Little ostentatious,
don't you think?
What was I thinking?
You're usually so dicsrete.
Tell you what... throw a little
hot rot red in there.
Yes, that shall help you
keep a low profile.
The render is complete.
Yeah, I like it.
Fabricate it and paint it.
Commensing an
automated assembly.
Estimated completion
time is five hours.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
The weapons manufacturing is...
only a one small part of what
Stark Industries is all about...
- Hey Tony, remember me?
- I sure don't.
You look great, Hef.
What's the world coming to when
a guy's gotta crash his own party?
Look at you!
- Hey, what a surprise!
- I'll see you inside.
Listen, take it slow, alright?
I got the Board where
I really want them.
You got it. Just cabin fever,
I'll just be a minute.
Give me a Scotch,
I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.
- Oh yeah, the guy from the...
Strategic Homeland
Intervention
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
God, you got... you need
a new name for that.
Yeah, I hear that a lot.
Listen, I know this must be
a trying time for you,
but we need to debrief you.
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,
and time can be a factor
with these things.
Lets just put something
on the books.
How about the 24th, at 7 p.m.
at Stark Industries?
Tell you what... you got it.
You're absolutely right.
Well... I'm gonna go to my
assistant and we'll make it date.
You look fantastic,
I didn't recognise you.
- What are you doing here?
- Avoiding government agents.
- Are you here by yourself?
- Where'd you get that dress?
It was a birthday present
from you, actually.
- I have great taste.
- Yes.
- You, uh, wanna dance?
- Oh, no, thank you. No.
Am I making you uncomfortable?
No, no.
I always forget to
wear a deodorant,
and dance with my boss
in front of everyone
that I work with,
in a dress with no back.
- You look great, you
smell great. - Oh, God.
But I could fire you,
if that'd take the edge off.
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.
- I'd make it a week.
Really? What's your
social security number?
- Five.
- Five?
You're missing just a
couple of digits there.
The other eight? That's why
I got you, for the other eight.
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.
- That was totally wierd.
- Totally harmless.
It was totally not harmless,
by the way.
- Nobody was watching us.
- Everybody who I work with...
I think you lost objectivity.
I think they... we just danced.
No, it was not
just the dance!
You don't understand
because you're you.
And everybody knows exactly who
you are, and how you are with girls.
And all that,
which is completely fine...
But you know, then me, you're
my boss and I'm dancing...
Because it makes me look like...
the one who's trying to...
I just think you're
overstating, that's all.
And we're here, and then I'm...
wearing this ridiculous dress...
And then we were
dancing like that and...
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it.
I would like a
vodka martini, please.
Very dry with olives,
lot of olives,
like at least three olives.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.
Make one of them dirty.
- Well... Tony Stark!
- Oh, hey!
Fancy seeing you here.
- Carrie. - Christine.
- That's right.
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.
Can I at least get
a reaction from you?
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.
I was reffering to your
company's involvement
in this latest attrocity.
- They just put my name
on the invitation,
I don't know what to tell you.
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.
I was out of town for a couple
of months, in case you didn't hear.
Is this what you call
accountability?
It's a town called Gulmira.
Heard of it?
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.
Well, I'm not my company.
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?
- What's going on? - Tony, you
can't afford to be this naive.
I was naive before,
when they said:
Here's the line, we don't cross it,
this is how we do business.
If we're double-dealing
under the table... are we?
Let's take a picture.
Come on.
Picture time!
Tony... who do you
think locked you out?
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.
It's the only way
I can protect you.
The fifteen miles hike
to the outskirts of Gulmira
can only be described
as a 'descent into Hell'.
Into a modern day
heart of darkness.
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages
have been driven
from their homes
displaced from their
lands by warlords,
emboldened by
a newfound power.
Villagers have been
forced to take shelter
in whatever ways
that they can find.
In the ruins of other villages
or here, in the remnants of
the old Soviet smelting plant.
Recent violence has been
attributed to a group
of foreign fighters, reffered to
by locals as the Ten Rings.
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.
A mission that can prove fatal to
anyone who stands in their way.
With no political will or
international pressure,
there's very little hope
for these refugees.
Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband
who was kidnapped
by insurgents.
Either forced to
join their militia...
...to anyone who will stop
a child's simple question:
"Where are my
mother and father?"
There's very little hope
for these refugees,
refugees who can only wonder
who, if anyone, will help.
Faster!
Women on the trucks!
The weapons here!
Abandon houses!
Hurry up!
Hold this rebel!
Put him with the others.
Father!
What the hell is this?
Kill this bastard!
You are incopetent!
Turn your head!
Father!
He is all yours.
AIR BASE EDWARDS,
CALIFORNIA
- What the hell was that?
- Are we clear to go in there?
No, sir. They were
using human shields.
We never got the green light.
Department of State,
they're gonna be all over this.
We got a bogey.
Is CIA on the line?
I got them on line,
they wanna know if it's us.
No, that definitely
is not us, sir.
- It wasn't navy.
- Wasn't marines.
I need answers! Can I please
get eyes on target?
Get me colonel Rhodes
from the Weapons developement
down here now!
We ran an ID check
and crossed reference
with all known databases.
We have nothing.
Any high-altitude surveillance
in the region?
We've got an AWAC and
a Global Hawk in the area.
So this things just
appeared out of nowhere?
How come it didn't
show up on the Radar?
It's got a minimum Radar
cross-section, sir.
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir. It's tiny.
We think it's an
unmanned aerial vehicle.
Colonel, what are we
dealing with here?
I'm gonna make a call.
- Hello?
- Tony?
- Who is this?
- It's Rhodes.
Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.
- Speak up, please.
- What the hell is that noise?
- I'm driving with the top down.
Yeah, well I need
your help right now.
It's funny how
that works, huh?
Yeah, speaking of funny,
we got a weapons depot
that was just blown up
a few cliques from where
you've been held captive.
- Well, that's a hot spot.
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did you job for you.
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?
- I was just jogging at the canyon.
- I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving to the
canyon where I'm gonna jog.
Are you sure you don't have
any tech in that area...
...I should know about?
- Nope.
Bogey spotted!
Okay, good, cause I'm
staring at one right now
and it's about to be
blown to kingdom come
War room, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sight.
- Whiplash One, what is it?
- I've got no idea.
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.
Then you are clear to engage.
Bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!
Incoming missile.
- Flairs!
Wait a second!
Bogey deployed flairs.
Deploy flaps!
Holly... this thing just
drove off the Radar, sir!
Satellite image has been lost.
- No way that's the U.A.V.
- What is it?
I can't see anything.
Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.
I think bogey has
been handled, sir.
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
- It's who?
I'm sorry, it IS me. You asked
what that was, and it was me.
No, see.. this isn't a game.
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.
You understand that?
It's not a piece of equipment.
I am in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Rhodey, you got anything for me?
Mark your position and
return to base. - Roger that.
On your belly!
It looks like a... man!
Shake him off!
Move, move!
I'm hit!
I'm hit!
Eject! Eject!
Whiplash One down.
- Whiplash 2, do you see a chute?
- Negative! No chute! No chute!
My chute's jammed!
Sir, I've got a visual
on a bogey.
Whiplash 2, reengage. If you
get a clear shot, you take it!
Major, we don't even know what we're
shooting at. Call off the Raptors.
That thing just took out an F-22
inside the legal no-fly zone.
Whiplash 2, if you have
a clear shot, take it.
They've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.
Keep going!
Got a chute!
Got a chute!
- Tony, are you still there?
- Hey, thanks.
Oh my God, you crazy
son of a bitch!
You owe me a plane,
you know that, right?
Yeah, well, technically
he hit me, so...
Now are you gonna come by and
see what I'm working on? - No, no.
The less I know the better.
Now what am I supposed
to tell to the press?
Training excercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?
It's not that simple.
An unfortunate
training excercise
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.
I'm pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.
As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,
it is still unclear who
or what intervened,
but I can assure you that the U.S.
government was not involved.
Oh, it isn't that bad, sir.
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.
Be gentle,
this is my first time.
I designed this to come off.
Please try not to move.
What's going on here?
Let's face it, this is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Welcome.
Compliments of Tony Stark.
If you killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.
Show me the weapon.
Come. Leave your
guards outside.
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.
So this is how he did it.
This is only a first crude effort.
Stark has perfected his design.
He has made a
masterpiece of death.
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.
And you dream of Stark's throne.
We have a common enemy.
We are still in business.
I will give you these designs...
...as a gift.
And in return...
...I hope you repay me
with a gift of iron soldiers.
This is the only gift
you will recieve.
Technology.
That's always been your Achilles
heel in this part of the world.
Don't worry. It will only
last for 15 minutes.
That's the least
of your problems.
Bring the armour
and the rest of it.
Alright, lets finish up here.
Set up Sector 16
underneath the Arc reactor.
And I want this dead and masked.
Recruit our top engineers.
I want a prototype right away.
Are you busy?
I need you to go to my office
and hack into the mainframe.
You're gonna retrieve all
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip,
this will get you in.
It's probably under
Executive Files, if not...
they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need to look
for the lowest
numeric heading.
And what do you plan to do
with this information
if I bring it back here?
- Same drill.
They've been dealing under
the table, I'm gonna stop them.
I'm gonna find my weapons
and destroy them.
Tony...
you know that I would
help you with anything,
but I can not help you if you're
gonna start all of this again.
There is nothing except this.
There's no art openings,
there's no benefit,
there's nothing to sign.
There's the next mission,
and nothing else.
Is that so?
Well, then I quit.
You stood by my side
all these years
while I reaped the
benefits of destruction.
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people
that I've put in harm's way,
your going to walk out?
You're gonna kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not gonna be a part of it.
I shouldn't be alive...
unless it was for a reason.
I'm not crazy, Pepper.
I just finally know
what I have to do.
And I know in my heart
that it's right.
You're all I have
too, you know.
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?
You did not tell us that
the target you paid us to kill
was the great Tony Stark.
As you can see,
Obadiah Stane, your deception
and lies will cost you dearly.
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.
So... what are we
gonna do about this?
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.
Ah, Tony. He always gets
the good stuff, doesn't he?
I was so happy...
when he came home. It was like
we got him back from the dead.
And now I realise...
...well, Tony never really
did come home, did he?
He left a part of himself
in that cave.
Breaks my heart.
Well...
He is a complicated person.
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be alright.
You are a very rare woman.
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.
Thank you. Thanks.
I gotta get back there.
Is that today's paper?
Yes.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.
- Of course.
Take care.
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.
Did you forget about
our appointment?
Nope. Right now,
come with me.
I'll give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.
We've been working our best.
Absolutely, we're... I'm gonna
have to call you back.
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored
what you've asked us
and it seems as though there's
a little hiccup, actually...
- A hiccup?
- Yes, to power the suit...
sir, the technology actually
doesn't exist. So it's...
Wait, wait, the technology?
William, here is
the technology.
I've asked you to simply
make it smaller.
Okay, sir, that's what
we're trying to do,
but honestly,
it's impossible.
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!
With a box of scraps!
I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.
Tony?
Tony, are you there?
Breathe.
Easy, easy...
You remember this one, right?
It's a shame the government
didn't approve.
There are so many applications
regarding short-term paralysis.
Ah, Tony.
When I ordered
the hit on you,
I was worried that I was...
...killing the golden goose.
But, you see...
it was just fate
that you survived it,
leaving one last
golden egg to give.
You really think that just
because you have an idea,
it belongs to you?
Your father, he helped to
give us the atomic bomb.
Now what kind of world
would it be today
if he was as selfish as you?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Ah, Tony...
This is your Ninth Symphony.
What a masterpiece!
Look at that.
This is your legacy.
The generation of weapons...
...with this at its heart.
The weapons that will help
stir the world back on course.
With the balance of power
in our hands.
In the right hands.
I wish you could see
my prototype.
It's not as... not as
conservative as yours.
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.
I would've prefered
that she lived.
What do you mean he paid
to have Tony killed?
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...
okay, where is Tony now?
I don't know, he's not
answering his phone.
Please go there and make
sure everything's okay.
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.
Good boy.
Tony?
Tony?
Tony?
Tony!
- Are you okay?
- Where is Pepper?
She's fine. She's with five agents
that are about to arrest Obadiah.
That's not gonna be enough.
Section 16.
Section 16...
There it is.
My key's not working,
it's not opening the door.
Wow, what is that? It's like
a little device, like a thing
that's gonna pick the lock?
-You may wanna take few steps back.
That's the coolest thing I've
ever seen. - Not bad, huh?
Let's do it.
You need me to do
anything else?
Keep the skies clear.
Damn!
Next time, baby.
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.
I thought it'll be bigger.
Take him out!
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is gonna hold up?
That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.
Keep me posted.
- Pepper.
- Tony?
- Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Obadiah, he's gone insane.
- I know. Listen!
- You better get outta there!
- He built the suit.
Get outta there, right now!
Where do you think
you're going?
Your services are
no longer required.
Stane!
- I love this suit!
- Put them down.
Collateral damage, Tony.
Defer the power
to chest piece.
Power reduced to 19%.
Lady!
For thirty years,
I've been holding you up.
I built this company
from nothing!
And nothing is gonna
stand in my way.
And least of all, you.
Impressive!
You upgraded your armour.
I've made some
upgrades of my own.
Sir, it appears that
his suit can fly.
Duly noted. Take me
to the maximum altitude.
With only 15% power, the odds
of reaching that altitude...
I know the math! Do it!
Sir, you're not gonna believe this.
That thing is back.
Get me major Allen.
Scramble the jets!
Not necessary, people,
just the training exercise.
- 13% power, sir.
- Climb!
-11%.
- Keep going!
- 7% power. - Just leave it on
the screen, stop telling me.
You had a great idea, Tony,
but my suit is more
advanced in every way!
How'd you solve
the icing problem?
Icing problem?
Might want to look into it.
We are now running on
emergency backup power.
- Potts!
- Tony!
Oh my God, are you okay?
I'm almost dead of power,
I gotta get out of this thing.
I'll be right there.
- Nice try.
Weapons status?
Repulsors are off line.
Flairs!
Very clever, Tony.
- Potts.
- Tony!
This isn't working, we're gonna
have to overload the reactor
and blast the roof.
- How are you gonna do that?
You're gonna do it.
Go to the central console,
open up bolt of circuits.
When I clear the roof
I'll let you know
and you're gonna hit
the master bypass button.
That's gonna fry
everything up here.
Okay, I am going in now.
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof, I'll buy you some time.
This looks important.
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,
but I must admit, I'm
deeply enjoying the suit.
You finally outdid
yourself, Tony.
It would've made
your father proud.
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!
Tony!
How ironic, Tony!
Trying to free
the world of weapons,
you gave it
the best one ever!
- Pepper!
- And now...
I'm gonna kill you with it!
You ripped up my
targeting system.
- Hit the button!
- You told me not to!
Hold still, you little prick.
- Just do it!
- You'll die!
Push it!
Tony!
We've all received
the official statement
of what occured at
Stark Industries last night.
There have been unconfirmed
reports that a robotic prototype
malfunctioned and caused
damage to the Arc reactor.
"Iron Man", that's kinda catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.
It's not technically accurate,
since it's a gold-titanium alloy,
but it's kinda attractive
name anyway.
Here is your alibi.
- Okay.
- You were on your yacht.
We told Pepper to put
you in Avalon all night
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.
I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me,
alone on the island.
That's what happened.
Just read it word for word.
There's nothing
about Stane here.
That's been handled.
He's on vacation.
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.
What about this whole story
that it's a body guard?
He's my body... ?
That's kinda flimsy.
This isn't my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.
Just stick to the official statement
and soon this will all be behind you.
You've got 90 seconds.
Oh, agent Coulson.
I just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
Right.
- Lets get the show on the road.
- You know, it's actually...
...not that bad... even I
don't think I'm Iron Man.
- You're not Iron Man.
- Yeah I am.
- You're not.
- Suite yourself.
If I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.
She'd be a wreck.
She'd always be worrying
that I was gonna die,
and yet proud of a man
I become. She'd be...
wildly conflicted, which
would only make her more...
crazy about me. Tell me you
never think about that night?
- What night?
- You know.
Are you talking about...
the night that we danced,
and went up to the roof...
and then...
you went downstairs
to get me a drink, and you...
left me there by myself?
Is that the night
you're talking about?
I thought so.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that'd be all, Ms. Potts.
And now Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.
He will not be taking
any questions, thank you.
It's been a while since
I was in front of you,
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.
There's been speculation that
I was involved in the events
that occured on a freeway
and the rooftop...
I'm sorry Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit,
that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that...
- I know that it's confusing...
It is one thing to question
the official story,
and another entirely
to make wild accusations
or insinuate that
I'm a superhero.
- I never said you're
a superhero. - You didn't?
Well, good, because that
would be outlandish and...
...fantastic.
I'm just not the hero type,
clearly. With this...
long list of character defects
and all the mistakes I've made,
largely in public.
- Just stick to the cards.
- Yeah, okay.
The truth is...
I am Iron Man.

Long ago that I'm
before Qty. but no evidence exists.
It has been said about my
participation on the events that occurred
- On the street ...
- Sorry, sir, but do not believe that the use
a bodyguard
be more appropriate.
Yes.
And if more
weapons in it.
One thing's have the official version and others
thing to do is point the finger
and say that I am a
kind of superhero.
You have to accept that I have
the kind of hero.
This long list of character defects
and the mistakes I made in public.
The point is ...
I am a man of iron.
- Am I wrong.
- Only some rest you will recover.
I can not go.
I'm wrong.

It's official, you irrevocably appoint director

Yes, that's ok.

Believe it or not, I was looking

I tried to imagine who would be

And then I realized that

You've always been you, I thought

I have the right to choose my

Why not keep it?
The truth is that I intend to present
something that is on your business.
If you invent something that works
I'll see if I can find a hole.
- Mr. Stark.
- Yes.
His desk is there.
I have a place this year.
You may need a hole Cristy.
Any other bad idea?
Tony and I are fine.
I love it, there is no rivalry.

Effective, is not very efficient.
But a copy is acceptable.
I do not understand with a little tact
You can earn good money selling
North Korea, China, Iran
Or straight to the black market.
One can see that you have friends
slums.
You come from families of thieves
and bandits.
Like all guilty.
You try to rewrite history.
And you forget all the lives that
Stark family destroyed.
Speaking of thieves, where did you get
design?

And if not, I'll be at your mercy
tonight.
Stark Now I have the best technology
myself.
Such are the fantasies that you did
look like toys next to my show.
Ivan If you understand, dear?
I do not know if you noticed, but I do not
I speak Russian!
I will retire and I'll
expo and I sleep with someone.
These two, they'll care.
Do not make them angry.
When you return, we'll renegotiate
the terms of our agreement.
And you shall comply with that
promised, because otherwise.
You'll be like you were when you took
imprisonment of one corpse.
Got it?
If you want to see me on TV.
Babas "could clear this?
You know I ...
Call the number
Mr. blocked
Now I can talk on the phone
perfect.
- Coulson as the land of enchantment.
- Hey Tony.
- How are you? Cycles duplicate.
- You what?
You said twice cycles, more power
and if it works.
You seem very happy to be
dead.
Just like you.
Rastrala.
Now, the real story of your surname
be revealed.
Where?
Accessing the Oracle network.
East Coast.
What your father did to my family
for 40 years will do yours.
- In 40 minutes.
- Looks good, you have to meet to discuss the matter.
Interstate Area, Manhattan and
surroundings.
Hope you're ready.
Trace complete.
In defense of peace
If you want to test me I think
too.
And while it assembles the process,
Armal now.
- Do not know if ...
- Do not want to hear Charly turbo.
That's better.
More.
Yes!
I'll leave the car here ok.
- Thanks.
- Sure.
I like this audience,
Thanks for coming.
Ladies and gentlemen long
This country has placed his men
and women in a serious risk.
Then came Iron Man and we thought
that the days of the killings were over.
Unfortunately we had no access
that technology.
That's not fair, not correct.
I think that's wrong.
There is, how awful.
Sinembargo was a great innovation and diverted
worldwide attention.
But now my friends, the media faces a
new problem.
They are on the brink of exhaustion
ink.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Today I present the new face
armed forces of our country.
The droids Hammer!
Air Force.
Marines!
Yes, Yes!
They are better than a cheerleader
Do not you think?
Even with this revolutionary
technology.
Will always be necessary for man
was present at the site of the battle.
Ladies and gentlemen I have the honor
present the first prototype of the suit.
Able to respond to a variety
weapons and attacks.
And for your team rider teninte
Colonel James Rhodes.
James?
For the country and its allies have heard ...
We have problems.
Tony civilians are not here.
They asked me to come, we should not
do it now.
Say Hello
Yes, very good!
These people are happy, we

- Maximum 5 minutes.
- You hit your home?
Listen I think it works with Vanko.
Vanko "still alive?
- Where?
- What?
Where is Vanko?
Who?
Dime.
What are you doing here, tell me?
Oh no, what happens?
I can not change, I have no control
suit.
Tony quit now, the whole system is
invaded.
We have to fix it.
Off.
No, no!
- Unlock, I need to.
- Roger.
Tony, Tony, my gun
is ready, I'm white.
- And what is it?
- It is you.
Tony flies!
What's happening?
- I have no control of the Software.
- Since we can not control?
I think the control of another
computer.
- It's impossible, I want the guards.
- The phones do not work.
- Find them on their phones.
- The phones do not work.
- We have blocked access to the main system.
- Who took access to the system?
Pepper, please beware
If everything is in order.
- If you or not.
- Yes, I'm serious.
The fact that Tony had not
come, it does not.
Please acompaense
Thank you.
We have to get people here.
Who did this?
Who is behind?
- Ivan Ivan Ivan Vanko.
- Where is he?
In my laboratory.
- With the police department.
- No, no, no.
- To send to headquarters.
- No, dear.
Thanks yes that is quick.
And you do not want to see take off.
Tell me everything you know about it.
More friend.
Mr Engine Restart
Nobody answered me,
What's happening?
- Get in the car, take me with them.
- I will not lead anywhere.
- So I drive?
- No, I condusco up, now what?
DISABLED
Well done.
- Tones have a lot behind you.
- So let's leave the expo.
When we reached the perimeter that you care.
I am going to break the Russian.
- Look ahead.
- Yes, I understand.
Another less.
Listen to Tony and a division of
denuevo go to the expo.
Thank you.
I'm getting closer.
It is also, cuidate.
- Stay in the car.
- I'll stay here.
I told him to stay inside the car.
Why did you get it?
I will not let you come alone.
Want to help satisfy the non-smoking.
Intruder Alert.
Hey, can not enter.
Takes Off
Miss each group communicates Andriod
in their own language.
Choose one and focus
where.
"They tried to Russian?, Try Russia.
I got it.
- Still no control?
- Yes.
So I want to prepare
You are about to get wet on this ride.
Wait, wait, wait.
He left.
Sorry buddy, but the only way
eliminated.
Where are you?
What do you do?
Restarting Rhodey suit.
Tony.
That gave me access.
Now reboot.
- Your friend is back.
- Thank you.
Everything is perfect with the new reactor and gives you a lot
more energy and his vital signs are promising.
If at the moment I'm not dying.
Thank you.
What do you mean you're dying?
Did you mean enserio die?
And you?
No, not anymore.
- What, what's going on?
- I would say, do not want to alarm you.
- Hibas're dying to tell me Tony.
- I have not seen ...
- Why do not you tell me?
- My plan was to prepare a homelet and tell him.
Has been discussed on honeymoon
Tony has the company.
- I think someone is looking for.
- Thanks. Peppers.
- Do you ever feel better?
- I'm fine, do not be angry.
- I'll apologize when ...
- If I get angry.
... I'm advocating an attack
of Hameroides.
- Okay. No, please.
- We could go to Venice.
Roy, wake up friend you need.
Are you awake reacts.
Barbarian you back your armor.
- Are you okay?
- I think so.
- Hey Tony sorry.
- Okay.
- No, I should have more confidence in you.
- I'll put in that position, never mind.
No, I know it's your fault, but I want
apologize.
Thanks, that's what I wanted to hear.
Pareja.
They are getting closer.
You can think of a plan?
We wanted to be up, so
that the greatest weapon should be working.
Yeah right.
- And you friend, where are you going?
- What are you talking about?
- He spoke to me.
- They want a big gun that is not the ultimate weapon.
- Tony not be jealous.
- No, do not scare your decor.
- I saw powerful.
- Okay.
Your list of top and attract me.
Do not stay here, you're the worst area
there.
- Whether you already have your place and mine?
- Tony is the worst area, this place will kill you.
- You like it?
- Yes, yes.
Duck!
I think you should start with that.
If it's just forgive chief
Once again, is that it ends.
I said five minutes ago.
Mr. strip is here.
- Sorry.
- You are arrested Mr.
- You're kidding right?
- Hands on the back.
I just want to help.
I got it, I know you do.
Intended to indict, and it is done.
You think you eliminate director
competition.
Ok, you think you have problems?
I'm going Caus a problem.
See you sooner than
thinking.
When you get the other I think they should
place in the southeast and northeast exit.
Yes, we stopped the train coming
Point Willes.
Load buses for people
along these lines.
- Yes, you come with us?
- No, I will stay until everything is solved.
Right.
Attention is approaching a
android again, this is different.
Has an energy much more driving.
It is a pleasure to come back.
This will get ugly.
I have something special Vanko
I realize its Bunker to her.
What?
It's the hammer?
Yes.
I got him.
Rhode, should be done.
Want to be a hero?
What?
I said I could use a companion.
Do not raise your hand.
Is that your idea?
I'm with you, do, do, do.
All of these exploit Andriod
should be here.
Peper.
Tony really can not take anymore,
and can not stand.
Do not take it then?
What about me do not look at me?
My body can not control
too much stress.
I do not know whether to kill or jump HiBase
vacuum.
- Or?
- Or break any company.
I think I did well.
I refuse to move me.
That is all.
What did you say?
Is that it?
I'm surprised, I guess I'm not surprised.
I understand that you have no excuses.
- No, excuse me please, do not look for excuses.
- If you're not sorry, but you have to find anything.
- No, sorry, I know it's justified ...
- Hey, you deserve more.
- Well ...
- I have always had great care.
I was in trouble and always
helped me.
- Thanks.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- How will my return address?
- I see it ...
- Yes, but the press and takes only a week in office ...
- But if you took years.
- I do not know.
As if it was the first president.
- Sure.
- No, I'm not.
Was this true?
We can prove it.
For me it was weird.
This is how two crows fighting grapes.
- I, and gave up ...
- Yes, well that is not ...
I heard no argument to justify
you said.
- Not have to go?
- I was here first quarter consiganse.
- I thought it would not make jokes.
- It's the last time I promise.
- Were you there, certainly.
- Thanks also.
Hey, my car was destroyed in the explosion and
I'll go with the suit once.
- No, I do not like the idea.
- There was no question.
How do I resign if I do not approve?
DRAFT AVENDERS
PRELIMINARY REPOR
I do not want to read it.
I do not know if you let it get more involved.
And this is indeed ajente
Romanoff and a report is yours.
Read it.
Mr Personality Summary
Stark is obsessive-compulsive disorder.
In my defense, it was last week.
Obvious destructive tendencies,
going to die, please.
And all I have.
Classic case "Narsizismo?
Right.
Another is here, the evaluation of recruitment
for the project Avenger, Iron Man himself.
- I have to think about it.
- Continued.
Stark Tony, is not recommended?
I do not see the point, as
approved and disapproved?
I have a new heart, I am
be good with Peppers.
I have a semi-stable relationship.
What makes us think that this operation
is that only you will use a consultant.
They have to be paid.
Although this may save salary
If instead you do me a favor.
They're coming and I'll be decorated Rhodey
Washington y. ..
Nobody comes.
I'll see what I can do.
It is a pleasure and an honor
deliver these two medals to Lt. Col.
Mr. James Rhodes and Tony Stark.
Who is a great ...
A great national treasure.
Thank you for your lieutenant colonel
excepsional action on the field.
- He deserves it.
- Thanks.
Thanks to Mr. Stark excepsional
performance.
He deserves it.
Sorry.
With his career just a painful sting.
Get ready for shooting.

The Tesseract has awakened.
It is on a neutral world, a human world.
They wield its power,
but our ally knows it's working, so that they never will learn.
He's ready to lead, and our force, our Chitauri will follow.
The world will be his and the universe yours.
And the humans, what can they do, but burn.
How bad is it?
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hour ago.
NASA didn't authorize Selvig to pull the test phase.
He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement
It just turned itself on?
What are the engine levels now?
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac.
How long to get everyone out?
Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
Do better.
Sir, evacuation maybe futile.
We should tell them to go back to sleep?
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,
there may not be a minimum safe distance.
I need you to make sure that phase
Sir, is that really a priority right now?
Until such time as the world ends,
we will act as though it intends to spin on.
Clear out the tech below. Every piece of phase 2 on a truck and gone.
Yes, sir. Come with me.
Talk to me, Doctor.
- Director.
- Is there anything we know for certain?
- Tesseract is misbehaving.
- Is that supposed to be funny?
No, it's not funny at all.
The Tesseract is not only active, she's...misbehaving.
-How soon until you pull the plug?
She's an energy source.
If we turn off the power, she turns it back on.
- If she reaches peak level...
- We've prepared for this, doctor.
- Harnessing energy from space.
- We don't have the harness.
Our calculations are far from complete.
Now she's throwing off interference, radiation
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.
That can be harmful.
Where's Agent Barton?
The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
Agent Barton, report to me.
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things.
- I can see better from a distance.
- Are you seeing anything that might
- set this thing off?
- Doctor, it's spiking again.
No one come or gone.
It's oven is clean.
No contacts, no I.M.'s.
If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.
- At this end?
- A cube of space, one end of the door.
Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.
Sir, please put down the spear!
You have a heart.
Please don't.
- I still need that.
- This doesn't have to get any messier.
Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else.
I am Loki of Asgard,
- and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
- Loki, brother of Thor?
We have no quarrel with your people.
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
- You planning to step on us?
- I come with glad tidings,
- of a world made free.
- Free from what?
Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
Once you accept that, in your heart...
You will know peace.
Yeah, you say peace, I kind of
think you mean the other piece.
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.
This place is about to blow
Drop a hundred feet of raw material,
he means to bury us.
- Like The Pharaohs of Odin.
- He was right.
He's right, the portal is collapsing in on itself.
You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
Drop him.
Need these vehicles.
- Who's that?
- He didn't tell me.
Hill, do you copy? Barton is....
He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
ets go, no no no.. leave leave, go.
We cleared upstairs, sir.
We need to go.
Director? Director Fury , do you copy?
The Tesseract is with the hostile force.
I have men down. Hill?
A lot of men still under,
don't know how many survivors.
Sound the general call,
I want every living soul not needing rescue
- looking for that briefcase.
- Roger that.
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a level seven.
As of right now, we are at war.
What do we do?
Subtitle By JAVANI
I do not want to end tonight.
I want to know how
for it to end.
Believe me, you must
to be better prepared.
Do you work?
Lermentoville?
Is he confident that we will do -
transport without him?
I thought that a General
Tchalakov handle exports.
Tchalakov. Running Boy, doll.
Outdated information
derived from the fall.
Famous Black Widow
it's just a pretty face.
Do I feel beautiful?
We do not need Lermentovia
transport tank.
Tell him that we give up
medium term by hand. It's true ...
You may have to write it down.
Yes?
You ask.
- Listen carefully ...
- Silenskin box 114, the third floor.
F-22 close to you 13 draw
kilometer radius.
Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.
- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working!
- This takes precedence.
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this
moron is giving me everything.
I don't give everything.
- Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.
- Natasha.
Barton's been compromised.
Let me put you on hold.
- Where's Barton now?
- We don't know.
- But he's alive.
- We think so.
I'll brief you on everything when you get back.
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts
me about as far as he can throw me.
No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
Oh, God.
- Do not come here!
- Who are you?
Go away. Here is a disease.
Are you a doctor?
My father did not wake up!
Body heat, and he
make noise, but did not open his eyes.
A slower rate.
My father ...
And when they?
Please...
Should have got paid up front, Banner.
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress,
you picked a hell of a place to settle.
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
-Then what is it? Yoga?
ou brought me to the edge of the city, smart.
I uh...assume the whole place is surrounded?
Just you and me.
And your actress buddy, is she a spy too?
Do you start that young?
- I did.
- Who are you?
Natasha Romanoff.
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.
No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
SHIELD. How did they find me?
We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance,
even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.
- Why?
- Nick Fury seems to trust you.
But now I need you to come in.
- What if I say no?
- I'll persuade you.
And what if the...other guy says no?
You've been more than a year without an incident.
I don't think you wanna break that streak.
I don't get every time what I want.
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.
- Well, those I actively try to avoid.
- This is the
Tesseract.
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
- What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
- Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken.
It omits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.
If there was, that's where I'd be.
- So Fury isn't after the monster?
- Not that he's told me.
And he tells you everything?
- Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
- He needs me in a cage?
- No one's gonna put you in a...
- Stop lying to me!
I'm sorry, that was mean.
I just wanted to see what you'd do.
Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that,
and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay?
Natasha.
Stand down. We're good here.
Just you and me?
This is out of line, Director.
You're dealing with forces you can't control.
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?
Did you feel an over abundance of control?
You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
Not Asgard. Loki.
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one? His brother.
Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile.
But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help either.
It's up to us.
Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2,
- it was designed for exactly...
- Phase 2 isn't ready, our enemy is.
- We need a response team.
- The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
- This isn't about The Avengers.
- We have seen the list.
We're running the world's greatest
covert security network
and you're gonna leave the fate of
human race to a handful of freaks.
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.
We need a response team.
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even,
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.
- You believe?
- War isn't won by sentiment, Director.
No, it's won by soldiers.
There's not enough time. I'm gotta
pull into the water.
- You wont be alone.
- .Oh God.
This guy is still alive.
Trouble sleeping?
I slept for 70 years, Sir.
I think I've had my fill.
Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.
I went under, the world was at war,
I wake up, they say we won.
They didn't say what we lost.
We've made some mistakes along the way.
Some very recently.
- You here with a mission, sir?
- I am.
- Trying to get me back in the world?
- Trying to save it.
Hydra's secret weapon.
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you.
He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to
unlimited sustainable energy.
That's something the world sorely needs.
- Who took it from you?
- He's called Loki.
He's not from around here.
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.
The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.
Ten bucks says you're wrong.
There's a debriefing package waiting
for you back at your apartment.
Is there anything you can tell us
about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
You should have left it in the ocean.
You're good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.
You disconnected the transition lines?
Are we off the grid?
Stark Towers is about to become a
beacon of self sustaining clean energy.
Wow, so maybe our reactor takes over
and it actually works?
I assume. Light her up.
- How does it look?
- Like Christmas, but with more...me.
Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign.
You need to do some press.
I can do some more tomorrow,
I'm working on the zoning for the next billboards.
Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
Enjoy the moment.
I remember.
Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.
I'm not in. I'm actually out.
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.
Levels are holding steady...I think.
Of course they are, I was directly involved.
Which brings me to my next question.
- How does it feel to be a genius?
- Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?
What do you mean? All this, came from you.
No. All this, came from that.
Give yourself some credit, please.
Stark Tower -
Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself, twelve percent of the credit.
- Twelve percent?
- An argument can be made for fifteen.
- Twelve percent for my baby?
- Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
- My private elevator.
- You mean our elevator?
It was teeming with sweaty workmen.
I'm going to pay for that comment about
percentages in some subtle way later on, aren't I?
Not gonna be that subtle.
I'll tell you what. Next building
is gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
- On the lease.
- Call your mom, can you bunk over?
Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid
my protocol's are being overwritten.
Stark, we need to talk.
You have reached the life model
decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
- This is urgent.
- Then leave it urgently.
- Security breach. That's on you.
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.
- Phil.
- I can't stay.
- Uh...his first name is Agent.
- Come on in, we're celebrating.
- Which is why he can't stay.Soon as possible.
- I don't like being handed things
- That's alright, cause I love to be handed things.
So, let's trade.
Thank you.
Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
- This isn't a consultation.
- Is this about The Avengers?
- Which I...I know nothing about.
- The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.
- And I didn't even qualify.
- I didn't know that either.
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self obsessed, don't play well with others.
- That I did know.
- This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
- Whatever. Miss Potts, got a sec?
- You know, I thought we were having a moment.
- I was having twelve percent of a moment.
This seems so serious, Phil's pretty shaken.
- How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
- What is all this?
This is uh...
This.
- I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.
- Tomorrow.
You have homework. You have a lot of homework.
Well, what if I didn't?
If you didn't?
You mean if you finished?
Then ...
Square deal. It's the last date.
Work hard.
- Do you drive past the airport, by chance?
- I can drop you.
Oh, fantastic. Does the cellist
You? Is it true relationship?
- He moved back to Portland.
- What?
We are a forty-minute
from the base, sir.
So this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?
A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero.
Banner thought gammer radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.
- Didn't really go his way, did it?
- Not so much.
When he's got that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
He's like a smart person.
I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially.
I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping.
I mean, I was...I was present while you were unconscious from the ice.
You know, it's really, it's just a...just a huge honor to have you on board.
- Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
- Oh, you are. Absolutely.
Uh...we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.
The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little...old fashioned?
Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light,
people might just need a little old fashioned.
- The Chitauri grow restless.
- Let them grow restless.
- I will lead them in the glorious battle.
- Battle? Against a meagre might of earth?
- Glorious, not lengthy.
If your force is as formidable as you claim.
You question us?
Question him?
He who put the scepter in your hand?
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose?
When you were cast out, defeated!
I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard. Betrayed.
Your ambition is little and full of childish need.
We look beyond the earth to great worlds
The Tesseract will avail.
You don't have the Tesseract yet.
I don't threaten.
But until I open the doors,
until your force is mine to command, you are the wars.
- You will have your war as guardian.
If you fail, -
if the Tesseract is kept from us,
there will be no realm, no barren moon,
no crevasse where I can't find you.
You think you know pain?
You will receive something sweet as pain.
- Get your captain equipment.
- All right.
Agent Romanoff , he's Captain Rogers.
- They need you on the bridge.
- See you there.
There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
- Trading Cards?
- They're vintage, he's very proud.
Dr. Banner.
Oh, yeah. Hi.
- They told me you'd be coming.
- Word is you can find the cube.
- Is that the only word on me?
- Only word I care about.
Must be strange for you, all of this.
- Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
- Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute.
It's gonna get a little hard to breath.
Is this is a submarine?
Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container?
Oh, no. This is much worse.
- All engine operating.SHEILD
emergency protocol,1 9 3.6 in effect. We're in, sir.
- Good.
- Lets vanish.
- Engage retro reflection panels.
- Reflection panels engaged.
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor, thank you for coming.
- Thanks for asking nicely.
- So, uh...how long am I staying?
- Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.
Where are you with that?
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible camera on the planet.
Cell phones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite,
- it's eyes and ears for us.
- That's still not gonna find them in time.
You have to narrow the field.
How many spectrometers do you have access to?
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know,
tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof
and calibrate them for gamma rays.
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition.
At least we could rule out a few places.
- Do you have somewhere for me to work?
- Agent Romanoff,
would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please.
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.
- Put over there.
- Is this the stuff you need?
- Yeah, Iridium.
It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons.
- It's very hard to get hold of
- Specially if SHIELD knows you need it.
Well, I didn't know!
The Tesseract is showing me so much.
It's...it's more than knowledge, it's truth.
I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?
- My next target.
- Tell me what you need.
I need a distraction.
And an eyeball.
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.
No, no. It's fine.
It's a vintage set.
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.
Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but...
We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match.
Weight, cross match, seventy nine percent.
- Location?
- Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Canning Strasse.
- He's not exactly hiding.
- Captain,
you're up.
Kneel before me.
I said.
Kneel!
Is not this simpler?
Is this not your natural state?
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,
that you crave subjugation.
The bright lure of freedom diminishes
your life's joy in a mad scramble for power,
and identity.
You were made to be ruled.
In the end, you will always kneel.
Not to men like you.
- There are no men like me.
- There are always men like you.
Look to your elder, people.
Let him be an example.
You know, the last time I was in Germany
and saw a man standing above everybody else,
we ended up disagreeing.
I'm not the one who's out of time.
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
Kneel.
Not today!
The guy's all over the place.
Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
Make your move, Reindeer names.
Good move.
- Mr Stark.
- Captain.
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not a word.
Just get in here.
We're low on time.
- I don't like it.
- What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
I don't remember it being that easy.
This guy packs a wallop.
Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow.
- What's your thing? Pilates?
- What?
It's like calisthenics.
You might have missed a couple things,
you know, doing time as a Capsicle.
- Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
- Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.
Where's this coming from?
What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
I'm not overly fond of what follows.
- Now there's that guy.
- Another Asgardian?
- Think the guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
- Stark, we need a plan of attack.
- I have a plan. Attack.
- I'd sit this one out, Cap.
- I don't see how I can.
These guys come from legends, they're basically Gods.
There's only one God, ma'am.
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
- Where's the Tesseract?
- I missed you too.
- Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
- Oh, you should thank me.
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy did the
All-Father have to muster to conjure you here?
Your precious earth.
I thought you dead.
Did you mourn?
- We all did.
Our father...
- Your father.
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?
We were raised together.
We played together, we fought together.
- Do you remember none of that?
- I remember a shadows.
living in the shade of your greatness.
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.
- I who was and should be king!
- So you take the world I love as recompense for
your imagined slights?
No, the earth is under my protection, Loki.
And you're doing a marvelous job with that.
The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you ideally threat.
- I mean to rule them. That's why should I not...
- Think yourself above them.
- Well, yes.
- Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.
A throne would suit you ill.
I've seen worlds you've never known about.
I have grown, Odin's son, in my exile.
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract. And when I wield it...
Who showed you this power?
Who controls the would be king?
- I am the king!
- Not here!
You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream!
You come home.
I do not have it.
You need the cube to bring me home,
but I've sent it off. I know not where.
You listen well, brother.
I'm listening.
- Do not touch me again.
- Then don't take my stuff.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Uh...Shakespeare in the park.
Doth mother know, you weareth her drapes?
This is beyond you, metal man.
Loki will face Asgardian justice.
He gives up the cube and he's all yours. Until then,
stay out of the way.
Tourist.
Okay.
How about that.
Thats enough!
- Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.
- I've come here to put and end to Loki's schemes!
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.
Uh...yep! No! Bad call! He loves his hammer!
You want me to put the hammer down?
Are we done here?
In case it's unclear, you try to escape,
you so much as scratch that glass.
Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap.
You get how that works?
Ant.
Boot.
It's an impressive cage.
Not built, I think, for me.
Built for something a lot stronger than you.
Oh, I've heard.
The mindless beast, makes play to be the man.
How desperate are you? You call on these lost creatures to defend you.
How desperate am I?
You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.
You talk about peace and you kill
cause it's fun.
You have made me very desperate.
You might not be glad that you did.
Ooh. It burns you to come so close.
To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power.
And for what?
A world for all mankind to share,
- and then to be reminded what real power is.
\- Well let me know if real power will want some magazine or something./
- He really grows on you, doesn't he?
- Loki's gonna drag this out.
- So, Thor, what's his play?
- He has an army called the Chitauri,
that none of Asgard nor any world know.
He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth.
- Return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
- An army,
- from outer space.
- So he's building another portal.
- That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
- Selvig?
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.
Loki has him under some kind of spell,
- along with one of ours.
- I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
- He's not leading an army from here.
- I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.
I don't care how you speak.
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.
He killed eighty people in two days.
- He's adopted.
- I think its about the mechanics.
- Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?
- It's a stabilizing agent.
Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
No hard feelings Point Break, you've got a mean swing.
Also, it means the portal can open as wide,
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.
That man is playing gallaga.
Thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.
- How does Fury even see these?
- He turns.
Sounds exhausting.
The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.
Only major component he still needs is a power source.
A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
Last night.
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the Extraction Theory papers.
Am I the only one who did the reading?
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
He got to heat the cube to a hundred and
twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect.
Well, if he could do that he could achieve
Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.
Finally, someone who speaks English.
- Is that what just happened?
- It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled.
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control
and turn into an enormous green rage monster.
- Thanks.
- Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube.
- I was hoping you might join him.
- Let's start with that stick of his
It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube.
And I'd like to know how Loki used it to
turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.
- Monkeys? I do not understand.
- I do.
- I understood that reference.
- Shall we play it, Doctor?
- This way, Sir.
The gamma readings are definitely
consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract.
- But it's gonna take weeks to process.
- If we bypass their mainframe
and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster,
we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.
All I packed was a tooth brush.
You know, you should come by Stark Towers sometime.Top ten floors, all R and D.
- You'd love it, it's candy land.
- Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I
kind of broke Harlem.
Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension.
No surprises.
- Nothing?
- Are you nuts?
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret?
- Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.
- No offense, Doctor.
- No, it....it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't
- handle pointy things.
- You're tiptoeing, big man.
- You need to strut.
- And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.
You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now?
Why not before? What isn't he telling us.
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
- You think Fury's hiding something?
- He is a spy.
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets.
It's bugging him too, isn't it?
- Uh, I just wanna finish my work here and...
- Doctor?
A world for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.
- I heard it.
- Well, I think that was meant for you.
Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.
The Stark Tower? That big ugly......, building in New York?
It's powered by Stark Reactors, self sustaining energy source.
- That building will run itself for what, a year?
- That's just the prototype.
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
So why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project?
I mean, What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?
I should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.
- I'm sorry, did you say.....?
- Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.
In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.
- Blueberry?
- Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically not possible.
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed.
We have orders, we should follow them.
Following is not really my style.
And you're all about style, aren't you?
Of the people in this room, which one is; a-wearing a spangly outfit, and b- not of use?
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?
Just find the cube.
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?
Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
The guy's not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us.
What he's got is an acme dynamite kit.
It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does..
And I'll read all about it.
Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
I'm exposed, like a nerve.
- It's a nightmare.
- You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel,
trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.
This stops it. This little circle of light.
It's part of me now, not just armor.
- It's a terrible privilege.
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.
- It's different.
Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gammer exposure should have killed you.
So you're saying that the Hulk,
the other guy, saved my life?
That's nice.
It's a nice sentiment.
Save it for what?
I guess we'll find out.
- You may not enjoy that.
- You just might.
As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster.
We've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee.
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.
- She'll be safe.
- Thank you.
It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig.
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.
- Erik is a good man.
- He talks about you a lot.
You changed his life.
- You changed everything around here.
- They were better as they were.
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we.
We come here battling like Bilchsteim.
- Like what?
- Bilchsteim. You know; huge, scaly, big antlers.
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.
They are repulsive, and
they trample everything in their path.
When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price.
And now again,
n my youth I courted war.
War hasn't started yet.
You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield,
it's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance upon me.
There's no pain that would prise his need from him.
A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.
- What are you asking me to do?
- I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?
Loki is a prisoner.
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?
There's not many people that can sneak up on me.
-But you figured I'd come after.
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,
you would appear as a friend,
as a balm.
- And I would cooperate.
- I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.
I'd say I've expanded his mind.
And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain.
What happens to his mind?
- Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
- Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
Tell me.
Before I worked for SHIELD, I
I made a name for myself.
I have a very specific skillset.
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.
I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way.
Agent Barton was sent to kill me,
he made a different call.
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
- I'll not let you out.
- Ah, no. But I like this
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?
Regime's fall everyday.
I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian,
Or I was.
- And what are you now?
- It's really not that complicated.
I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.
Can you?
Can you wipe out that much red?
Drakoff's daughter?
Sao Paulo?
The hospital file?
Barton told me everything.
Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red,
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?
This is the basest sentimentality.
This is a child at prayer.
Pathetic.
You lie and kill
in the service of liars and killers.
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,
something that makes up for the horrors.
But they are a part of you,
and they will never go away.
I won't barter Barton! Not until I make him kill you.
Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work,
and when he screams I'll split his skull
This is my bargain, you mewling quin!
You're a monster.
Oh, no.
You brought the monster.
- So, Banner? That's your play?
- What?
Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way.
Set the door locked.
Thank you, for your cooperation.
- What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
- kind of been wondering the same thing about you
- You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
- We are, the model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now.
When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.
And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.
What is Phase 2?
Phase 2 is SHIELD used the cube to make weapons.
-Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.
-Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.This does not
\ - mean that we're./
- I'm sorry, Nick.
What were you lying?
- I was wrong, Director. The world hasn't changed a bit.
- Do you know about this?
- You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?
- I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.
- Loki's manipulating you.
- And you've been doing what exactly?
- You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
- Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.
I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
Because of him.
- Me?
- Last year earth had a visitor from another planet
who had a grudge mass that levelled a small town.
We learned that not only are we not alone,
but we are hopelessly, hilariously
- out gunned.
- My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
But you're not the only people out there, are you?
And, you're not the only threat.
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,
- they can't be controlled.
- Like you controlled the cube?
You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.
It is the signal to all the realms that the
earth is ready for a higher form of war.
- A higher form?
- You forced our hand.We had to come up with something.
A nuclear deterrent.
cause that always calms everything right down.
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?
- I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep...
- Wait, Wait, Hold on. How is this now about me?
- I'm sorry, isn't everything?
- I thought humans were more evolved than this.
- Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?
- We can..
- You speak of control, yet you court chaos.
- It's his M.O., isn't it?
I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.
We're...we're a time-bomb.
- You need to step away.
- Why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?
- You know damn well why! Back off!
- Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.
Yeah, big man in a suit of armor.
- Take that off, what are you?
- Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.
I've seen the footage.
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
I think I would just cut the wire.
Always a way out.
You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero
A hero, like you?
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.
Put on the suite, let's go a few rounds.
- You people are so petty, and tiny.
- Yes, right.
- Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his
- Where? You're renting my room.
- The cell was just...
- In case you needed to kill me.
but you can't! I know, I tried.
I got low,
I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out.
So I moved on, I focused on helping other people.
I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show.
and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret,
Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?
Dr. Banner.
put down the scepter.
All right.
- Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my party trick after all.
- Located the Tesseract?
- I can get there faster.
- The Tesseract belongs on Asgard,
- no human is a match for it.
- You're not going alone!
You gonna stop me?
Put on the suit, let's find out.
- I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
- Put on the suit.
Oh, my God.
- Put on the suit!
- Yep.
- Hill!
- Its a detonation. Number three engines is down.
-We're been hit.
-Fire engines.
- Talk to me.
- Turbine looks mostly intact, -
but it is impossible to get out there and repair when we already there.
If we lose one of engine we wont be.
- Someone gonna get outside and patch the engine.
- Stark, did you capy that?
- I'm on it.
Okay.
You okay right?
Keep that engine down.
Attention.wait the cameras going dark.
Stay close.
Level four.
Engine three. I'll meet you there.
Doctor.
Bruce, you gotta fight.
This is just what Loki wants.
We're gonna be okay. Listen to me.
We're gonna be okay. Right?
I swear on my life I will get you out of this,
you will walk away, and never...
Your life?
Bruce.
We have been carrying 180 to the south. Takes us to the water.
Free wind. Navigation
recalibration after the engine failure.
- Is the sun coming up?
- Yes sir.
Then put it on the left.
Takes us on the water.
One more turbine goes down
we're trapped.
Stark!
- Stark, I'm here!
- Good.
See what we got.
I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online
before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.
I need you to get to that engine control panel
and tell me which relays are in overload position.
What's it look like in there?
It seems to run on some form of electricity.
Well, you're not wrong.
We're not your enemies, Banner.
Try to think.
The relays are intact.
- What's our next move?
- Even if I clear the rotors,
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.
- I'm gonna have to get in there and push.
- Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.
Then stay in the control unit and reverse
polarity long enough to disengage mag..
- Speak English.
See that red lever?
It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.
Stand by it, wait for my word.
I need full evac on lower deck.
Grenade.
We gotta perimeter breach.
Hostile wiped SHIELD gear.
Hulk and Thor are in the research level
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!
- Get his attention.
- Escorts, Six o proceed to the.
- Don't get too close.
Target acquired.
Target engaged.
Target in moving.
Engine now all shut down.
Sir we lost all engine one.
It's Barton. He took out our system.
He's headed for the detention lab.
Does anybody copy?
This is Agent Romanoff.I copy.
- Stark,we losing altitude.
- I have noticed.
No!
Are you ever not going to fall for that?
The humans think us immortal. Should we test that?
Move away please.
Do you like this?
We started working on the prototype after you sent The Destroyer.
Even I don't know what it does.
Do you wanna find out?
No!
Natasha ...
You're gonna lose.
Am I?
It's in your nature.
You're heroes are scattered,
your floating fortress falls from the sky.
- Where is my disadvantage?
- Your lack conviction.
I don't think I...
So that's what it does.
- Cap, need a lever.
- I need a minute here!
Lever, now!
I'm sorry, boss. They got rabbited.
Just stay awake. Eyes on me
- No, I'm clockin' out here
- Not an option.
It's okay, boss.
This was never gonna work if they didn't have something to.....
Agent Coulson is down.
- The medical team on the way to the location.
- They're here.
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
Guess he never did get you to sign them.
We're dead in the air up here. Our communications,
location of the cube,
Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
Lost my one good eye.
Maybe I had that coming.
Yes.
We were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.
I never put all my chips on that number though,
because I was playing something even riskier.
There was an idea, Stark knows this,
called The Avengers Initiative.
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people,
see if they could become something more.
See if they could work together when we needed them to,
to fight the battles that we never could.
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea,
in heroes.
Well, it's an old fashioned notion.
You fell out of the sky.
- Did I hurt anybody?
- There's nobody around here to get hurt.
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.
- Lucky.
- Or just good aim.
You were awake when you fell.
- You saw?
- The whole thing, right through the ceiling.
Big and green and buck ass nude.
Here...
I didn't think those would fit you until
you shrunk down to a regular size fella.
Thank you.
- Are you an alien?
- What?
- From outer space, an alien?
- No.
Well then, son. You've got a condition.
Clint, You're gonna be alright.
You know that? Is that what you know?
I got...I gotta go in though.
I gotta flush him out.
- We don't have that long, it's gonna take time.
- I don't understand.
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?
Pull you out and send something else in?
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?
You know that I do.
Why am I back? How did you get him out?
Cognitive recalibration.
I hit you really hard in the head.
Thanks.
Natasha,
- how many agents?
- Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint.
This is Loki.
This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.
- Loki, he got away?
- Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?
I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
He's gonna make his play soon though. Today.
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah? Who's we?
I don't know. Who's ever left.
Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eye socket, I'd sleep better I suppose.
Now you sound like you.
But you don't.
You're a spy, not a soldier.
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?
What did Loki do to you?
He didn't, I just...
Natasha.
I've been compromised.
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.
- Was he married?
- No
He was a...cellist, I think.
I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.
- He was an idiot.
- Why? For believing?
- For taking on Loki alone.
- He was doing his job.
He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...
- Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
- Right. How did that work for him?
- Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?
- We're not soldiers!
- I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
- Neither am I.
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does,
but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done.
Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list...
He made it personal.
- That's not the point.
- That is the point. That's Loki's point.
- He hit us all right where we live. Why?
- To tear us apart.
He had to conquer his greed,
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?
That's what he wants. He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.
- He wants an audience.
- Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
Yeah. That's just previews, this is...
this is opening night. And Loki, he's a full-tail diva.
He wants flowers, he wants parades,
he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered.
I hope that would be true.
- Time to go.
- Go where?
I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?
I can.
You got a suit? Yeah.
Then suit up.
- You guys aren't authorized to be in here.
- Son, just don't.
Sir.
Done is jacket.
Ranugal
Ranugal
They needed to push.
They found it. Get our communications back up
whatever you have to do.
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes sir.
This device has already self sustainig.
- Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
- It's too late.
It can't stop now.
He wants to show us something!
- A new universe.
- Okay.
The barrier is pure energy. It's unbreachable.
Yeah I get that.
Plan B.
- Sir, mark 7 is not ready for deployment.
- Then skip the spinning ring.We're run out of clock.
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
- Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten.
- You should have left your armor on for that.
Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
You've got the blue stick of destiny.
- Stalling me won't change anything.
- No, no, no! Threatening.
The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that.
- What have I to fear?
- The Avengers.
It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team.
Earth's Mightiest Heroes type of thing.
- Yes, I've met them.
- Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.
But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend
a man with breath-taking anger management issues
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
- That was the plan.
- Not a great plan.
When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
- I have an army.
- We have a Hulk.
-I thought the beast had wandered off.
-You're missing the point. There's no throne,
there is no version of this, where you come out on top.
Maybe your army comes and
maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.
Because if we can't protect the Earth,
you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.
How will your friends have time for me,
when they're so busy fighting you?
- It should work!
- Well, performance issues. You know?
Jarvis, anytime now.
- You will all fall before me.
And there's one other person you pissed off!
His name is Phil.
Right.
Army.
Loki, turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it!
You can't.
There is no stopping it.
- There is only the war!
- So be it.
- Stark, we're heading north east.
- What, did you stop for drive-through?
Swing that park, I'm gonna lay them out for you.
- So we have more incoming.
- Lets keep them occupied.
- Nat.
- Did you see them?
We need back up there.
- Stark, are you seeing this?
- I'm seeing, still working on believing..
- Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
- Banner?
Just keep me posted.
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.
Look at this. Look around you.
You think this madness will end with your rule?
It's too late. It's too late to stop it.
No. We can, together.
Sentiment!
You got civilian trap in the roof.
Loki.
There more down there.
- We got this. Go Go.
- You think you can hold them off?
Captain,
it would be my genuine pleasure.
- Just like Budapest all over again!
- You and I remember Budapest very differently.
National guard?
Does the army know what's happening here?
Do we?
I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire.
You take them through the basement or through the subway, you keep them off the streets
- I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
- Why the hell should I take orders from you?
I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets
I wanna shut off the perimeter all the way down of 39 Street.
Well, we got its attention.
Where it heads to?
- Lets Thor hear what says.
- The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable
Thor is right, we gotta deal with these guys.
- How do we do this? As a team.
- I have unfinished business with Loki.
- Yeah, get in line.
- Save it.
Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild.
We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us...
So, this all seems horrible.
- I've seen worse.
- Sorry.
No, we could use a little worse.
- Stark, we got him,
- Banne.
- just like you said.
- Tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.
I don't see how that's a party.
Dr. Banner,
Dr. Banner, now might be a good time for you to get angry.
That's my secret, Captain.
I'm always angry.
Hold on.
Send the rest.
Guys.
- Call it, Captain.
Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we're gonna use containment.
Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.
Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or your turn it to ash.
- Wanna give me a lift?
- Right. Better clench up, Legoolas.
Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow them down.
You've got the lightning, light the bastards up.
You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And
Hulk,
bSMASH/b
(Mean Hulk Smash, Grrr, like that ^^)
(so Fun, Hulk can understand now XoXoXo)
Sir.
Stark, you have a lot of
Strand out here.
- I try to keep them off the streets.
- But they cant bang with the them.
- Find the ....
- I will roger that.
Oh, boy.
Nice call, what else do you got?
We force taking out the squadron on 6.
And it didn't invite me.
Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal.
- Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.- Well, maybe it's not about guns
You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride.
I could use a boost though.
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Turn, turn.
This way.
Director Fury, the council has made a decision.
I recognize the council has made a decision,
but given that it's a stupid assed decision, I've elected to ignore it.
Director, you're closer than any of our subs, you scramble that jet
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,
I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.
If we don't hold them in the air, we lose everything.
I'd send that bird out, we already have.
Hawkeye.
- Nat, what are you doing?
- Little help.
I got him.
Enough!
You are all of you beneath me!
I am God,
you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by.
Puny God.
Doctor.
Loki's scepter, the energy...the Tesseract can't fight. You can't protect against yourself.
It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing.
Well, actually I think I did.
I built in a safety to cut the power source.
- Loki's scepter.
- It may be able to close the portal.
And I'm looking right at it.
Sir, we're losing power before penetrate that shell.
JARVIS, you hear
the Tell of Jonah?
I'm considering be a role model.
Director of Fury no longer responsible.
overwrite order 7-Alfa-1-1.
We are about to take off.
Sir we have born in motion.
Anyone on the deck?
We need to shut it down.
I repeat, take off not authorized.
Stark, do you hear me?
We have a missile headed straight for the city.
- How long?
- Three minutes, at best.
Stay load and wipe out them.
- Jarvis, put anything we got it.
- I just did.
The package is set. detonation in two
minutes and thirty seconds from now.
You ready for another bout?
What, you gettin' sleepy?
Right of to the front.
I can close it! Can anybody copy?
- I can shut the portal down!
- Do it!
- No, wait!
- Stark, these things are still coming!
I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute.
And I know just where to put it.
Stark, you know that's a one way trip.
- Save the rest for the turn jarvs.
- Shall I tray Miss Potts?
- Where her?
New York streets
has become a battleground.
The army is here, and try to contain
violence, but clearly
But the billionaire
Iron Man, Tony Stark ...
Come on, Stark.
Close it.
Son of a guy.
He's not slowing down.
What the hell?
What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me?
We won.
Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job
guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma?
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.
- I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.
- We're not finished yet
And then shawarma after.
If it's all the same to you,
I'll have that drink now.
This point of devastation what has been confirmed extra terrestrial attack be a extraordinary a heroic group known as
Avengers has been.....
I love you, Thor!
Super hero in New York?
Give me a break!
These so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city.
This was their fight. Where are they now?
Captain America saved my life.
Whatever he is
and whatever any of them are i just
just want a say thank you.
- Where the Avengers?
- I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.
I'd say they'd earned a leave of absence.
- And the Tesseract?
- The Tesseract is where it belongs,
Out of our reach.
That's not your call.
I didn't make it.
So you let him take it and the war criminal, Loki,
who should be answering for his crime.
Oh, I think he will be.
I don't think you understand what you've started,
letting in The Avengers loose on some this world.
- They dangerous.
- They surely are,
and the whole world knows it. Every world knows it.
Was that the point in all this? A statement.
A promise.
How does it work now?
They've gone their separate ways,
some pretty extremely far.
We get into a situation like this again,
what happens then?
They'll come back.
- Are you really sure about that?
- I am.
- Why?
- Because we'll need them to.
- Mam.
- Hai.
Where do you find all these people?
SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor.
These soldier. A man out of time.

Would you like a drink?
No drink? You Sure?
I'm having one.
The Council is on.
I got a ride.
I just didn't argue with the God that did.

TONY: A famous man once said,
"We create our own demons."
Who said that?
What does that even mean?
Doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.
So, now, he was famous
and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.
I don't, uh...
(SIGHS)
I'm going to start again.
Let's track this from the beginning.
('90s POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING) Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that
lives in a blue world
And all day and all night
and everything he sees
ls just blue like him
inside and outside
Blue is his house
with a blue little window
And a blue Corvette
And everything is blue
for him and himself
And everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody...

(CHUCKUNG)
Half hour till the ball drops.
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?
- Great speech, man!
- HAPPY: I got you, pal.
I gave a speech? How was it?
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.
- Where are we going?
- Uh, to town, on each other.
Probably back in your room
because I also want to
see your research.
Okay, you can see my research,
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."
Mr Stark.
Ho Yinsen.
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."
-(CHUCKLES HUMOURLESSLY)
- Come here.
I would like to
introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.
- Oh, this guy. Hey.
- Mr Stark.
-(GREETS IN MANDARIN)
- You're a heart doctor.
She's going to need
a cardiologist after I...
(HONKING)
- Bye.
- Perhaps another time?
TONY: It started in
Bern, Switzerland. 1999.
(PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
- The old days.
- KILLIAN: Mr Stark!
TONY: I never thought they
would come back to bite me.
Why would they?
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!
Aldrich Killian. (STUTTERING)
I'm a big fan of your work.
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.
Well, of course, but, Ms Hansen,
my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.
TONY: Yeah, we're full.
Oh, wow, he made it.
He made the cut.
What floor you going to, pal?
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.
The ground floor, actually,
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.
- Uh...
- She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.
"Advanced Idea Mechanics"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?
- I see that, because it's on your T-shirt.
- Aw!
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.
Thank you, I'll call you.
(WOMEN TALKING EXCITEDLY)
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.
You know what I'm talking about?
I'll see you up there.
TONY: Damn betcha.
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.
Well, it was.
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain
-that governs repair...
- TONY: Wow.
MAYA: ...and chemically recode it.
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...
BOTH: ...operating system...
-...of a living organism.
- Exactly.
- Yes.
- Wow.
Is that...
Can you...
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.
- Happy...
- Hmm. That's cute...
Leave her ficus alone.
Because.
And, no, seriously, don't.
TONY: And you're starting with plants.
MAYA: For now, yeah.
TONY: Huh.
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.
- Well, it's...
- BOTH: Human application.
Exactly, exactly.
- Dendritic revitalisation.
-It's revolutionary.
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.
...even limb regrowth.
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.
Wow.
- In Switzerland.
- Hmm. That's better.
- Aw, you're seeing things.
- This week.

-(GLASS SHATTERING)
This is what I'm talking about,

- The what?
-HAPPY: Down!

- We're good.
- Stay down.
You... You're...
You're right on me. I made it.
What the hell was that?
(PEOPLE OUTSIDE
COUNTING DOWN)
- What was that?
- MAYA: It's a glitch in my work. It's...
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.
HAPPY: It's not Y2K.
-(PEOPLE OUTSIDE CHEERING)
- Hey! Happy New Year!
- HAPPY: Happy New Year.
- MAYA: Happy New Year.
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
- HAPPY: You good?
- Yeah.
- HAPPY: I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
TONY'. So, why am I telling you this?
Because I had just created demons
and I didn't even know it.
- Yeah, those were good times.
-(DOOR CLOSES)
Then I moved on.
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.
I forgot that night in Switzerland.
These days, I'm a changed man.
JARVIS: Forty-six.
- TONY: I'm different now.
-(TONY GROANS)
I'm... Well...
JARVIS: Forty-seven.
TONY: You know who I am.
Ow!
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...
No. Forty-eight.

(GROANING)
As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.
TONY: I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.
I didn't think it could get any worse.
(GROANING SOFTLY)
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
That's when he happened.
THE MANDARIN: Some people
call me a terrorist.
(MAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
(GUNS FIRING)
I consider myself a teacher.
(CHEERING)
America.
Ready for another lesson?
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited
until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind
and claim their land.
39 hours ago,
the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.
I... I... I did that.
A quaint military church
filled with wives and children,
of course.
The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.
The braves were away.
President Ellis.
You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.
And now you've missed me again.
(MEN YELLING)
(GUNS FIRING)
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.
And you'll never see me coming.
PAT KIERNAN: Now that
we seem to be back,
let's recap some
of the frightening developments...
American airwaves were hijacked...
The nation remains on high alert.
All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.
ELLIS: Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource.
I know him
as Colonel James Rhodes.
The American people
will soon know him
as the Iron Patriot.
And how is President Ellis responding?
By taking the guy
they call War Machine
and giving him a paint job.
The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.
Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."
You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?
(GRUFFLY)
"I am Iron Patriot!" it sucks.
Listen. "War Machine"
was a little too aggressive.
All right?
This sends a better message.
(SIGHS)
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
It's classified information, Tony.
Okay, there have been nine bombings.
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.
There's no bomb casings.
You know I can help.
Just ask.
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.
(STAMMERING)
I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.
You're going to come at me like that?
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...
...tator.
Do you mind signing my drawing?
- If Richard doesn't mind.
-(CHUCKLES)
Are you all right with this, Dick?
RHODEY:
Yeah. Fine with me.
- TONY: What's your name?
-Erin.
I loved you in A Christmas Story,
by the way.
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.
After New York, aliens... Come on.
They need to look strong.
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...
-it's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.
- I get it.
-It's American business.
That's why I said I got it.
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)
- Are you okay?
I broke the crayon.
ERIN:
Are you okay, Mr Stark?
-(MUFFLED) Take it easy. Tony.
-(INHALES SHARPLY)
(WHISPERING) How did you
get out of the Wormhole?
-(GASPS)
- Wait a minute. Tony!
TONY: What did you say?

(GRUNTS) Sorry.
(BREATHLESSLY) I'm just
checking on the suit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
Okay.
(PANTING)
(GASPING)
Check the heart.
(STAMMERING)
Is it the brain?
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.
Okay, so I was poisoned?
My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.
- Me?
-(METALLIC CLINKING)
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.
TONY: Sorry, I gotta split.
(GRUNTS)
(CROWD GASPS IN AWE)
HAPPY: Badge.
- Badge.
-(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Come on, badge.
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.
- This is an asset that we can put to use.
- Uh-huh.
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.
We should start
phasing it out immediately.
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,
-you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head of Security. Okay?
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.
- However...
- I do appreciate it.
-...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.
...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.
It's not...
It is a compliment.
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.
- I. .. Yes.
- SECRETARY: Excuse me.
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.
- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?
Happy, we'll talk about this later,
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.
How so?
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,
so it's a little awkward.
I don't like the sound of that.

Killian?
You look great.
You look really great.
PEPPER: (STAMMERING)

What on earth have you been doing?
Nothing fancy.
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.
And please, call me Aldrich.
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge.
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

Hey, guy.
Merry Christmas.
KILLIAN: After years dodging
the President's ban
On "immoral" biotech research,
my think tank
now has a little something
in the pipeline.
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.
I'm gonna turn your lights down.
Regard the human brain.
(HUMMING)
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.
But if I do that...
That's the brain.
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?
Wow, that's amazing.
Thanks, it's mine.
What?
This. You're inside my head.
It's a...
It's a live feed.
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.
Come on.
Now, pinch my arm.
- I can take it. Pinch me.
-(CHUCKLES)
(GASPS) What is that?
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.
But this is what I wanted to show you.
(BEEPS)
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential
and it goes here.
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us
is that our mind,
our entire DNA, in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.
Wow.
(QUIET RINGING)
(WHISPERS)
Oh, wait...
-(RINGING CONTINUES)

-(CHIMES)
- Hello?
- TONY: Is this Forehead of Security?
- What?
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.
What, harassing interns?
Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened
when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?
- They would laugh in my face.
(TONY CHUCKLES)
I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.
Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.
What's going on? Fill me in.
- For real?
- Yeah.
All right.
So, she's meeting up with this scientist.
- Rich guy. Handsome.
- Rig ht.
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.
- Oh, yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.
Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.
Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...
Where were we in '99?
- The science conference?
-Um...
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.
Of course you don't remember.
He's not a blond with a big rack.
At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.
But now it's, like, getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.
- His what?
- Big brain.
And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?
Look at what? You, watching them?
Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!
Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.
All right?
I don't work for you.
And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.
He's shifty.
- Relax.
- Seriously?
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you
and you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.
I miss you, Happy-
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.
Now you're off with the super-friends.
I don't know
what's going on with you any more.
- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!
(STAMMERING)
I hate to cut you off.
- Do you have your Taser on you?
- Why?
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.
You should probably go over there
and zap her.
Yeah, nice.
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism
and recode its DNA.
- That would be incredible.
- Hmm.
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...
Tony, TOW-
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.
He turned me down.
But something tells me
now there's a new genius on the throne
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more
and who has slightly less of an ego.
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.
As much as I'd like to help you.
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.
But then,
as my father used to say,
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."
- That's very deep.
- Hmm.
And I have no idea
what it means.
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.
(INHALES SHARPLY) Happy.
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.
Yes, I just, um...

I'm just gonna...

You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like, Mark 15?

You know, everybody needs a hobby.
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?
TONY:

You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag
-at first, so...
-(CHUCKLES)
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?
Yes, I did. I...
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.
Is it gonna fit through the door?
TONY: Well, actually,
it's a good question.
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.
- Okay.
- So, uh...
Tense? Good day? Huh?
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?
Did I like it?
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.
I appreciate the thought very much.
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?
(IMITATING COMPUTER BEEPING)
Huh...
Yep. Damn it, no can do.
You want to just kiss it on the...
- The facial slit?
- Uh-huh.
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?
Crowbar, yeah.
Oh! Except there's been
(STAMMERING) a radiation leak.
- PEPPER: I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

And yes, I had a quick bite.
I didn't know if you were coming home
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.
- What?
- What?
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?
Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.
- I wasn't.
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.
Come on. Pep?
Hey, I admit it.
My fault. Sorry.
I'm a piping hot mess.
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.

Is that what you want?
Here's a little holiday greeting
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided
that you just died, pal.
I'm gonna come get the body.

Lots of theatre. Close.

of 3,000 degrees Celsius.

No bomb parts found in a three-mile

Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.
It's urgent.
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

Because I read the papers and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.
I'll be fine.

I don't like it.

You don't like it.

Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

Uh...
Sorry.

Thank you.
Nice haircut. it suits you.
Nice watch.

MAN: Excuse me.
TONY: Mrs Davis?
Mind if I join you?

Sure is.
All right.
Where would you like to start?
I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.
I want to know
what you think happened.
Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.
Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.
Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?
Supposed to meet someone here?
Yeah.
Mrs Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.
Someone used him.
What?
As a weapon.
You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?
-(GASPS)

Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?
Homeland Security. We good here?
No, we're not "good."
(CHUCKLES HUMOURLESSLY)
I need a little more information
than that.
BRANDT: Well, I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.
SHERIFF: Yeah?
Well, why don't you
get on the horn
to Nashville and, uh, upgrade me?
All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way,

And C, if you do someone a solid,

All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.
Unlike you?
Admit it, you need me.
We're connected.
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,
keep your trap shut, guard the suit,
and stay connected to the telephone
because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?
Can you feel that? We're done here.
Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.
Bye, kid.
I'm sorry, kid.
You did good.
So, now you're just gonna

Yeah.
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,

Mr Vice President,
I think you should see this.
RODRIGUEZ:
Oh, God, not again.
Is the President getting this?
(CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY)
Mr President.
Only two lessons remain.
And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.
Meet Thomas Richards.
Good strong name.
Good strong job.
Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.
(SOBBING)
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.
(SOBBING CONTINUES)
I'm going to shoot him in the head,
live on your television in 30 seconds.
THOMAS: No!
The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.
Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?
America,
if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,
Tom lives.
Go!
(CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY)
How did he hack my phone?
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...
I have to make this call.
I'd strongly advise against that.
This is the right thing to do.

So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.
Because nothing,
not your army, not your red, white

can save YOU.
I'll see you soon.
Tell Rhodes,

Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.
We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan

Hello?
You ever have a chick straddling you

Yeah, I've had that.
Who is this?
TONY: It's me, pal.
Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,
you came looking for me.
What are you doing?
A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.
What are you doing?
Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AIM, right?
Yeah.
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat right now, I need your login.
It's the same as
it's always been, "WarMachine68."
And password, please.
Well, look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.
It's not the '80s,
nobody says "hack" any more.
Give me your login.

- My hair's a little...
-it's fine.
It's not right,

Right.
I don't want to make things awkward

-(GARY CHUCKLES)
- I'm sorry. Is that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...
I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.
- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?
I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.
I got an issue.
I'm chasing bad guys.
I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.
I don't have enough juice.
I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?
Recalibrate the lSDNs.
Pump it up by about 40%.
- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.
Yeah.
Tony needs Gary.
And Gary needs Tony.
- Be quiet about it. Go.

Right, pal?
It's faulty,

Sold it to the Mandarin.
Got you, pal.
MAYA: What happened?
MAYA: Fun fact.
Before he built rockets for the Nazis,
the idealistic Wernher von Braun
dreamed of space travel.
He stargazed.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Do you know what he said when
the first V-2 hit London?
"The rocket performed perfectly.
"It just landed on the wrong planet."
See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.
And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.
And you look up,
you're a long way from shore.
You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.
I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.
That's exactly what we used to do.
So, don't judge yourself.
Thank you, Pepper.
I really appreciate that.

I'm trying to fix this thing.

Oh, I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark when he threatened us?
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.
Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.

Yes, ma'am.

No need to thank me, ma'am.

I've acquired the Patriot armour.
RHODEY: If you want this suit,
you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.
That's the plan, Colonel.
TONY: Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?
- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.
- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.
Jarvis, how are we?
JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,
and then at the end of the sentence
I say the wrong cranberry.
And, sir, you were right.
Once I factored in
available AIM downlink facilities
I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa,
Iran, Pakistan, Syria?
Where is it?
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,
but not right now.
Harley, where is he really?
Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.
Um, it does say Miami, Florida.
Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?
Uh, it's not charging.
(TYRES SCREECHING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.
It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?
It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna...
I don't wanna... (BREATHING HEAVILY)
Oh, God, not again.
- HARLEY: Tony?
-(GASPING)
Are you having another attack?
I didn't even mention New York.
Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.
Okay, um, uh...
(PANTING)
God, what am I gonna do?
Just breathe.
Really, just breathe.
You're a mechanic, right?

Yes, I did.

You're not him.

Where?
Where's the Mandarin?
Where is he?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's here. He's here, but he's not here.

It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.

TONY: What are you?
What are you, a decoy?
You're a double, right?
What, you mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.
Don't hurt the face!
I'm an actor.
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," see, it's not real.
Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Well, I, um, had a little
problem with, um, substances.
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.
- Next?
- Then,
they approached me
about the role,
and they knew about the drugs.
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?
They said they'd give me more.
They gave me things.
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.
They gave me things.
(SNORING)
Did you just nod off?
Hey.
No, and a lovely speedboat.
And the thing was, he needed someone
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.
(MIMICS EXPLOSION)
"He"?
- Killian?
- Killian.
- He created you?
- He created me.
Custom-made terror threat.
Yes. Yes.
His think tank thinked it up.
The pathology of a serial killer.
The manipulation
of Western iconography.
(WITHOUT ACCENT)
Ready for another lesson?
Blah, blah, blah.
No.
(WITH ACCENT) Of course,
it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.
Your performance?
Where people died?
No, they didn't.
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma
and he might not wake up.
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.
You under...
(GRUNTS)
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?
No.
You should have pressed
the panic button.
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
(TYPING)
TONY: Ah...
(SIGHS) okay-
It's just like old times, huh?
Oh, yeah. With zip ties.
It's a ball.
It wasn't my idea.
Okay. So you took Killian's card.
I took his money.
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.
- No.
- Yeah.
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.
Yeah?
(SIGHS)
A lot has happened, Tony.
But I'm close.
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.
Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Then help me fix it.
Did I do that?
Yes.
I remember the night, not the morning.
Is this what
you've been chasing around?
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.
You wanted to help people.
Now look at you.
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who
still has their soul.
Get me out of here.
Come on.
KILLIAN: You know what my old man
used to say to me?
One of his favourite of many sayings...
"The early bird gets the worm, but
the second mouse gets the cheese."
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?
I'm here to thank you.
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.
Desperation.
If you think back to Switzerland,
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?
Well, for the first 20 minutes,
I actually thought you'd show up.
And the next hour...
I considered taking that
one-step shortcut to the lobby.
If you know what I mean.
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.
But as I looked out over that city,
nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,
no one was even looking.
I had a thought that would
guide me for years to come.
Anonymity, Tony.
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.
Right?
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.
Because the second
you give evil a face,
a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,
you hand the people a target.
You're something else.
You have met him, I assume?
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...
He's a stage actor.
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.
Anyway, the point is,
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,
subtlety has kind of had its day.
What's next for you in your world?
Well, I wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.
(ORBS HUMMING)
Desperation.
Now, this is live.
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment
the body is trying to decide
whether to accept EXTREMIS
or just give up.
And if it gives up,
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.
-(CLICKS)
-(HUMMING CEASES)
We haven't even talked salary yet.
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?
MAYA: Let him go.
Hold on, hold on.
Maya...
I said, let him go.
What are you doing?
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.
Maya, give me the injector.
If I die, Killian,
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?
We're not doing this, okay?
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
KILLIAN: The good news is,
a high-level position
has just been vacated.
(GROANS)
(SIGHS)
You are a maniac.
No, I'm a visionary.
But I do own a maniac.
And he takes the stage tonight.
Once we get the Patriot installed,
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.
Well, that's great,
but the last time I looked
there was somebody
inside of it.

Aw, crap.
(GROANING)
(GRUNTING)
Tony?
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.
- No. You got yours'?
-Uh... Mmm.
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
(SNORING)
- You, you, you! Move! Get out!
-(GIRLS WHIMPERING)
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.
- What's this? I had winners.
-(GUNSHOTS)
What have you come as?
You make a move,
and I break your face.
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.
This is the Mandarin?
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.
- Doing what?
-(SIZZLING)
on! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.
Spill.
RHODEY: Do you know
what they did to my suit?
What? No.
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.
Something to do with a big boat.
I can take you there.
(CHANTING)
Ole', ole', ole', ole'...
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.
Is that...
Is that important?
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.
TONY: So?
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any transport.
- Right.
-(BEER OPENS)
Hey, Ringo.
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
But we also have to figure out this
-vice president thing, right?
- Right.
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh! That's the vice president.
Thanks.
Hello?
TONY". Sir, this is Tony Stark.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,
surrounded by the Agency's finest.
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.
I think we're good, here.
RHODEY: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.
They're gonna take out
the president somehow.
We have to immediately
alert that plane.
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Rhodes and Stark out.
Everything okay, sir?
Couldn't be better.
I love you, babe.
Colonel Rhodes.
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.
RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.
JARVIS: Sir,
I have an update from Malibu.
The cranes have finally arrived,
and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.
TONY: And what about
the suit I'm wearing?
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.
That's going to have to do.
Oh! Here he comes.
Here he comes. Get a quick picture.
Sure.
Oh!
(SIZZLING)
(BEEPING)
Everything all right, Colonel?
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
(GROANING)
(SCREAMING)

It is an honour, Mr President.
If you're gonna do it, do it!
Whoa! Cool your boots, sir.
That's not how the Mandarin works.
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.
Internal shots, temperature spikes.
Get me eyes on it now.
Image coming through now, sir.
Was that Rhodes?
-(BANGING)
- MAN: Is anyone there?
WOMAN: Let us out!

What's your name? Heather?
(SCREAMING)
(SHRIEKING)
HEATHER: Oh, God! No! No!
TONY: Listen to me.
See that guy?
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.
- You got it?
- What? Oh!
(HEATHER RESUMES SCREAMING)
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.
We can do this, Heather.
(HEATHER WHIMPERING)
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.
(SCREAMING)
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?
That's what we're going to do.
JARVIS: 18,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.
Nice.
JARVIS: 10,000 feet.
(YELLING)
6,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Come on, come on, come on!
Yeah!

TONY: He's a chunky monkey,
let's get him.
Hello.
(TONY STRAINING)
(PASSENGERS CHEERING)
MAN: We made it!
Nice work, guys!
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.
All right, Jarvis.
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...
(SIGHING)
That came out of nowhere.
Wow.
Give me some good news, man.
I think they all made it.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, but I missed the president.
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?
Uh... Say, Jarvis,
is it that time?
The House Party Protocol, sir?
Correct.
(GASPS)
Hi.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You think he's gonna help you?
He won't.
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.
You're here as my, um...
trophy-
(CHUCKLES) Mmm.
Good evening, sir.
(GASPS)
Welcome aboard, Mr President.
KILLIAN: Ever hear
of an elephant graveyard?
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.
This is the Roxxon Norco.
And, of course, you'll remember
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.
What do you want from me?
Uh, nothing, sir.
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.
You see, I've moved on.
I found myself
a new political patron,
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.
String him up.
Hey!
(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
Come on.
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?
TONY: I hope not.
Oh, my God.
(SIGHS) He's strung up over the oil

Public execution.
Yeah, death by oil.

You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

- They're not universal, Tony.
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.
You've got, like, five of them.
Here's what I'm going to do.
Save my spot, ready?
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.
Here we go. (CLEARS THROAT)

Yep.

(GASPS)
TONY: Nice timing.
Oh, yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?
Oh, I'm sorry,
they're only coded to me.
What does that mean?
I got you covered.

I'll be damned.

Whatever.
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!
You're right. I don't deserve her.
Here's where you're wrong.
She was already perfect.
-(STRAINING)

I am the Mandarin!
(BREATHING HARD)
I got nothing.
(GRUNTING)
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!
(REPULSOR POWERING UP)

What?
Oh, what, are you mad at me?
(GRUNTING)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Whoo!
(PANTING)
TONY: Honey?
Oh, my God.
That was really violent.
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?
Who's the hot mess now?
It's still debatable.
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress
like this at home? Hmm?
Sport bra. The whole deal.
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.
What am I going to complain
about now?
Well, it's me.
You'll think of something.
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.
Not hot.
Am I gonna be okay?
No.
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.
I think I can get you better.
That's what I do. I fix stuff.
And all your distractions?
Uh... I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.
Jarvis. Hey.
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?
You know what to do.
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.
(KISSES)
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?
(SIGHS)
It'll do.
TONY: And so,
as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.
You start with something pure,
something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.
The compromises.
- We create our own demons.
-(REPORTERS CALLING)
- Oh!
-(ALL CLAMOURING)
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!
TONY: As promised, I got Pepper
sorted out. It took some tinkering.
But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"
Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous,
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.
And now, neither will I.
- Let me tell you...
-(METAL CLINKING)
...that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.
(GASPING)
(COUGHING)
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
(WEAKLY) No, look.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(LAUGHS)
TONY: So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...
I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,
or a hobby.
It was a cocoon.
And now,
I'm a changed man.
You can take away my house,
all my tricks and toys.
One thing you can't take away...
I am Iron Man.
(THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING)
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
TONY: You know, and thank you
by the way. For listening.
Plus, something about just getting it off
my chest,
and putting it out there in the
atmosphere, instead of holding this in...
I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.
Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts
and my experiences with someone,
it just cuts the weight of it in half.
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.
Everything comes full circle.
-(GASPS)
- And the fact that you've been able to
-help me process...
-(CLEARS THROAT)
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.
We were at, uh...
Are you actively napping?
(STAMMERING)
I was... I... I drifted.
Where did I lose you?
Elevator in Switzerland.
So, you heard none of it.
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.
I'm not a therapist.
- It's not my training.
- So?
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?
Temperament.
You know what?
Now that I think about it...
Oh! God, my original wound.
-1983, all right?
- Yes.
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.

I know we all think

We're supposed to feel that way.
We're graduating.

what makes life valuable

What makes it precious
is that it ends.

- Hey.
- What's wrong?
Are you all right?
I don't know what I'm doing.
It's my father, isn't it?
Yeah.
I see him everywhere I go.
I can't... I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.
- Yeah, but we've talked about this.
- I know, but, Gwen...
- It's not his choice.
- Gwen.
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.
And now I'm gonna come and
eat dinner with your family.
How can I do this?
What does this make me?
I don't know,
what does that make you?
It makes me not able to
live with myself.
- I thought that it meant you loved me.
- I do love you.
I love you.
Then why isn't that enough?
Huh?
Because what if
something happens to you
just like it happened to him
because of me?
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- Listen. No, n...
I cannot let that happen.
Listen to me.
You're Spider-Man...
and I love that.
But I love Peter Parker more.
()
That's worth it to me.
I can't lose you too.
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together,
who does that work out for, Peter?
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.
Wow.
You have done this to me
again and again, Peter.
I can't live like this.
I break up with you.
I break up with you.

REPORTER 1:
Good morning, New Yorkers.
Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.
A few clouds to start us off...
REPORTER 2: The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate
over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.
REPORTER 3:
How about that Spider-Man?
Last night on the Manhattan
Bridge, he saved a dozen lives.
We wanna hear your calls.
MAN 1: I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.
MAN 2: Who do you think pays the bills
for all the damages he causes, huh?
It's you and me, taxpayers.
- You make this?
- Yeah.
This is a wind turbine.
You made this? No way.
This is amazing.
It's good as new, right?
I'll walk you home.
- What's your name?
- Jorge.
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.
MAN: I don't feel like my kids
are safe with him out there.
Get out of the way and let
the police do their job.
WOMAN 1: Some folks think that there
might be more than one Spider-Man.
(SHRIEKS)
What do you think?
One guy or many?
WOMAN 2: I'd love to know
who's behind that mask.
Hey.
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.
RADIO HOST: We have a caller on the line
named Max. He says he knows Spider-Man.
MAX: Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.
He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.
He saved my life one time.
We sort of became best friends.
SPIDER-MAN (IN MUFFLED VOICE):
How much?
Hey, you're that spider guy.
I'm Spider-Man.
Huh?

- Yeah. I'm okay.
I'm just...
I'm very naked right now.
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

We have no chimney.

Aces, Max, aces.
I've been out saving the world.

a birthday today?
That's why you're here.
You remembered my birthday.
(LAUGHS)
All the crime-fighting you've
been doing, and all of a sudden,
you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to...
But of course you would.
Why wouldn't you visit me?
We're best friends.
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.
I know what they say
about you in the press
but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.
Because you're amazing.
Wow. That's what the press needs.
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.
You like that, Spidey?
I like it a lot, Max.
Good. Because today
is going to be
amazing.
Yeah. Circuit 39.
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
I just wanna know if you
can find another waitress
to replace me because I start
my training rounds
at the hospital.
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.
Because he'll worry.
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.
Uh, double shift on Thursday.
Okay, bye.
- Who was that?
- Harvey.
- Doing a double shift, huh?
- Sometimes.
Got nothing else to do.
I like the girls.
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar. Heh.
Mm.
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle, so that ought to help.
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.
Jameson pays me a fair wage.
If it was 1961, he
pays me a fair wage.
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.
- I'm doing my laundry.
- No, I do the laundry.
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.
I understand that.
I'm in college now.
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red
- so no.
- That was a mistake.
Because I was washing
the American flag.
- My... Can I please just...?
- No one washes a flag.
I do, and I won't anymore.
- This is my machine.
- Fine. It's just underwear.
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.
Back off, eat your breakfast.
All right, laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.
- I'll do it.
- No, forget it.
- Give it to me.
- I'll do it some other time.

first electromagnetic power grid.
By converting aging power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers,
we are generating clean, green,

to power Manhattan,
the five boroughs
and eventually the world
for generations to come.
- Dillon. You're late.
- Doggone trains are so slow, sir.
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible
for the entire city's
energy supply?
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid
and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that,
and those power grids
were designed by me.
You designed them?
Sure you did.
And I'm Spider-Man.
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna
rip your well-groomed head off!
Now, get to work.
What floor, please?
- Seventy-four.
- Thank you.
GWEN: Oh, hold that!
- Can you hold that, please?
- I got it.
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.
Most people would have
just let those close.

Uh, sixty-three.

No, you threw me away.
(SIGHS)
You kicked me off to
boarding school when I was 11.
On my 16th birthday,
you sent me Scotch.
Or one of your assistants did.
I'm pretty sure
because the card read:
With compliments, Norman Osborn."
I don't expect forgiveness from you
anymore.
I don't believe in miracles.
How could you possibly understand
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed
for something greater?
And not just for me.

NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): Norman Osborn, the legendary
founder and CEO of Oscorp Industries, has died,
the Osborn estate has confirmed.
He is survived by his
only son, Harry Osborn
who is the sole heir of the
Oscorp corporate empire.
Harry.
Osborn changed the medical
profession's approach to human healing
and affected
the lives of millions.
I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:
"We can do better.
And we should do better."
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."
But change isn't just a slogan.
It begins with hard work.
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.
Mr. Osborn changed the world.
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.
But not today.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
Today is for mourning.

There's a current flow problem in

MENKEN: Harry,
Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny
in the wake of
Dr. Connors' recent, uh,
breach of trust.
You mean people are pissed off
because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.
Given that,
all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed
to restore investor confidence.
Ah. That is the Osborn way.
Whatever's inconvenient around
here, just get rid of it, right?
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.
Sure, sure. I get it.
Twenty-year-old kid.

What was Dad thinking?
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?
Surely, someone must've
questioned his sanity in the end.
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.
It would've made this
conversation a lot easier.
- Harry...
- It's Mr. Osborn.
We're not friends.
Hi.
You were his assistant, right?
Mm-hm.
What's your name?
Felicia.
HARRY: Felicia.
From now on,
everybody at this table

Well, good. Then you can all

Just wanted to come and see you.

And you were so there for me
when my parents...
Well, that's why I'm here for you.
Thank you.
Ah, it's good to see you, man.
It's good to see you.
I'm sorry about your dad.
You got your braces off.

thing is so exhausting.

Really? She works for me?
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

You know, when my
father sent me away
I tried to forget
everything about this place.
I guess that kind of included you.
You ain't gotta explain
anything to me, man.
We both got dumped.
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?
My dad left a briefcase.
That's all I got,
briefcase full of junk.
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.
How's that working out for you?
Perfectly.
Dude. Nice arm.
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.
(OVER SPEAKER) You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.
HARRY: Yeah, right.
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.
Giant lizards
and spider guys.
Just one guy. Just one spider man.
Or woman. We don't know for sure.
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.
I'm so impressed.
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.
For what?
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."

MENKEN: Who was he?
MAN: Maxwell Dillon.
Electrical engineer.
No associates or friends
to speak of.
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.
The guy was
invisible.
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.
We've gotta find a way
to get him out.
In the meantime, if the press
gets hold of this accident,
our stock will crater.

stays invisible.

NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV):
Our coverage
of this breaking story begins with New
York 1's Jessica Abo at the scene.
That's right. We're standing
here with two eyewitnesses
who are going to tell
us what they just saw.
Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?
How do you think
he beat this creature?
Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized, Spidey's suit.
That's why he didn't get electrocuted.
Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.
JESSICA: Thank you very
much to the two of you.
As you can tell, so many questions
remain unanswered.
We will bring you the latest
information as it becomes available.
For now, Jessica Abo, New York 1.
Let's send it back to you.

I'll beg and bribe

When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help

Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well

Give me reasons to believe
That you would do
The same for me
And I would do it
For you

You will never sleep alone

KARI:
Next-generation military body armor.
Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair,
direct nervous system interface.
So the common household spider,
um, unlike human cells,
theirs contain the
power to self-heal
from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.
We've used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA.
JALLINGS (ON COMPUTER): Welcome
to Dr. Jallings, Science Investigator.
Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.
The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge
- the battery might explode!
- Ouch!
Explode!
Boom!
When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.
You're not invincible.
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

Hey, Harry. What...?
What time is it?
Uh, late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.
I need to see you.
You all right?
Not really, Pete.
I'm dying.
But I think you can help
save my life.
You're looking at the world's

RICHARD: The hope is to extract
the venom from their glands
and turn that into a cure.
An agent that heals diseased cells.
NORMAN: And if I can be cured, imagine
what this could do for other diseases
like Alzheimer's, even cancer.
HARRY:
They never made it to human trials.
It's 14 years of research,

I don't think you can
just set up a van

I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive
about people shoving needles and...
Ah, he's sensitive, okay.
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is,
and I will go ask him myself.
What?
- HARRY: You took his picture.
- So?

There was an accident in the genomics

And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.
And he loved Spider-Man, by
the way. He was, like, a fanatic.
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a
"want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.
That's actually kind of
what it's like to love you.
I was searching for him in the computer

is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.
Or something worse.

The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.
You were this little boy
whose whole world
was turned upside down
with no explanation.
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,

No.

A few days after the funeral,
two government men came to see us.
They said the genetics research
that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable,
and that people
would pay a lot for it.
And that's why he ran off with it.
They said he was a traitor.
I couldn't believe it, Peter.
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us,
for the money.
I don't...
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.
It doesn't make any sense.
Peter, I don't know.
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.
What had I missed?
What had I missed?
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.
He wore the same ratty
lab coat for 20 years.
He took the D train to
work at 7 every morning.

a part of themselves they hide.

I can't give you my blood.

Excuse me?
It's too dangerous.
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.
I'm already dying.
Your blood can't make me die more.
But it could do something worse.

My name is Richard Parker.
Whatever lies will
be told about me,
I would like the world
to know the truth.
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research
when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization
to continue funding my research.
And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.
Weapons. Biological
weapons, of course.
So I refused.
And now, to eliminate
me from the picture,
Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me
in order to take
control of my work.
GUARD 1: Can I help you?
Uh, yeah, you can open the gate.
I'm Harry Osborn.
Now, there's a patient in that

GUARD 1: Joe, this is
Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.
GUARD 2: Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING
AND GUARDS GROANING)
But it doesn't matter because
there's something else...
that Norman doesn't know.
The human DNA
that I implanted in the spiders...
was my own.
Which means that without me,
without my bloodline,
Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.
Keep Electro incubated
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.
RICHARD: I have destroyed as much
as possible from the archives.
(ALARM BLARING)
But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.
But as a father,
it means I may not
see my boy again.
And nothing is as important to me
as my son, Peter.
Nothing in this world.
But I have a responsibility
to protect the world
from what I've created,
and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.
People will say I am a monster
for what I've done.

We're not on different paths.
You're my path.
And you're always gonna be my path.
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.
But I'm tired of them.
I'm tired of every
single one of them.
We've all gotta make a choice.
Right? Well, I choose you.
So
here's my thought.
England.
Both of us.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm following you now.
I'm just gonna follow
you everywhere.
I'm just gonna follow
you the rest of my life.
I mean, they got crime
there in England.
- Yeah.
- They got tons of crime, it seems.
- Tons.
- They got, uh,
- Jack the Ripper.
- Heh, heh.
What?
They haven't caught Jack the
Ripper yet. You didn't know that?

What the hell is that?
Is that Max?
He must have cut the
power to the whole city.

Hey, write down what
you remember, people.
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?
There's an emergency
reset at the power plant.
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.
How will I stop him? Every time I get
close, he fries my web shooters.
- Have you tried grounding them?
- Tried everything.
- Rubber, plastic...
- Did you try magnetizing them?
I didn't try magnetizing them.
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?
If you magnetize a nail
with a battery...
- It holds an electric charge.
- Yes.

HARRY: Good.
Start with him.
NEWSCASTER (ON TV):
Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich
was broken out of
a classified penitentiary
known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.
It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity
since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.
The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.
Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department
has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping
for the return
of the web-slinger.
The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:
Where is Spider-Man?
(TURNS TV OFF)
Oh. Too bad about that spider guy.
Too bad he's disappeared. Seems
like everybody really needs him.

- No.
No. God, no.

No matter how buried it gets,

you must promise me
that you will hold on to hope.
Keep it alive.
We have to be greater
than what we suffer.
My wish for you
is to become hope.
People need that.
And even if we fail,
what better way is there to live?
As we look around here today
at all of the people
who helped make us who we are,

Won't you look in the sky?

The behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's
Never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence
Only last a minute
Land on your dreams
And recognize you live it

With bare feet
Run through the flames

Just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me
You watching me lick 'em clean

My highs, my lows

Report to your stations immediately.
This is not a drill.
We are under attack!
We are under attack!
- Shit!
- Language!
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?
The central building is protected
by some kind of energy shield.
Strucker's technology is well beyond
any other Hydra base we've taken.
Loki's scepter must be here.
Strucker couldn't mount
this defense without it.
At long last.
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.
Wait a second. No one else is gonna deal
with the fact that Cap just said "Language"?
I know.
Just slipped out.
- Who gave the order to attack?
- Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.
They have to be after the scepter.
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.
Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.
A hit may make them close ranks.
Everything we've accomplished...
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.
Send out the twins.
It's too soon.
It's what they signed up for.
My men can hold them.
Sir, the city is taking fire.
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.
Send in the Iron Legion.
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.
We are here to help.
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.
Please back away.
- We wish to avoid collateral damage.
- Costel!
We will inform you

- We are here to help.
- Avengers, go home!
We are here to help.
We will not yield!
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.
We will send them back in bags.
- No surrender!
- No surrender!
I am going to surrender.
You delete everything.
If we give the Avengers the weapons,
they may not look too far
- into what we've been...
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...
- No, no, I mean...
Twins.
You didn't see that coming?
Clint!
- We have an Enhanced in the field.
- Clint's hit!
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?
Thank you.
Stark, we really need to get inside.
I'm closing in.
Jarvis, am I closing in?
Do you see a power source
for that shield?
There's a particle wave
below the north tower.
Great, I want to poke it with something.
The drawbridge is down, people.
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.
In fact, I still haven't.
Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.
We're gonna need evac.
I can get Barton to the jet.
The sooner we're gone, the better.
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.
- Looks like they're lining up.
- Well, they're excited.
Find the scepter.
And for gosh sake, watch your language!
That's not going away any time soon.
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.
- It was a good talk.
- No, it wasn't.

Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.

and an air current.
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.

Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
Baron Strucker.
Hydra's number one thug.
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.
Where's Loki's scepter?
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."
How many are there?
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.
You'll have to be faster than...
Guys, I got Strucker.
Yeah, I got something bigger.
Thor,
I got eyes on the prize.
You could have saved us.
Why didn't you do more?
We're just gonna let him take it?
Hey, the lullaby
worked better than ever.
Just wasn't expecting a code green.
You hadn't been there, there would've
been double the casualties.
My best friend would've been
a treasured memory.
You know, sometimes exactly what I want
to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.
How long before you trust me?
It's not you I don't trust.
Thor, report on the Hulk.
The gates of Hel are filled
with the screams of his victims.
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.
Hey, Banner,
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
- Yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.
Tell her to prep everything.
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
- Very good, sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.
Yes, sir.
Approach vector is locked.
Feels good, yeah?
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...
No, but this...
This brings it to a close.
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.
I don't just mean weapons.
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.
Is that cool with you?
Just a few days till the farewell party.
You're staying, right?
Yes, yes, of course.
A victory should be honored with revels.
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.
So, yes, revels.
- Lab's all set up, boss.
- Actually, he's the boss.
I just pay for everything and design
everything and make everyone look cooler.
- What's the word on Strucker?
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?
- Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.
Sokovia's had a rough history.
It's nowhere special, but it's on the way
to everywhere special.
Their abilities?
He's got increased metabolism
and improved thermal homeostasis.
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.
He's fast and she's weird.
Well, they're gonna show up again.
Agreed. File says they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.
- It's nuts.
- Right.
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them
to protect their country?
- We're not at war, Captain.
- They are.
- How's he doing?
- Unfortunately, he's still Barton.
- That's terrible.
- He's fine. He's thirsty.
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.
We only got a couple of days with this
joystick, so let's make the most of it.
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.
The scepter is alien.
- There are elements I can't quantify.
- So there's elements you can?
The jewel appears to be
a protective housing
for something inside,
something powerful.
- Like a reactor?
- Like a computer.
I believe I'm deciphering code.
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.
There's no possibility of deterioration.
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.
She's creating tissue.
If you brought him to my lab,
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.
- He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?
- No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- That I can't fix.
This is the next thing, Tony.
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.
That is exactly the plan.
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.
Unlike you, I don't have
a lot of time for parties.
Will Thor be there?
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the scepter.
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.
You may recognize...
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.
Started out, Jarvis was
just a natural language UI.
Now he runs the Iron Legion.
He runs more of the business
than anyone besides Pepper.
- Top of the line.
- Yes.
I suspect not for long.
Meet the competition.
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.
I mean, this could be...
It's not a human mind.
I mean, look at this.
They're like neurons firing.
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.
They deep-sixed the data, but...
I gotta guess he was knocking
on a very particular door.
Artificial intelligence.
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.
- I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
- Yesterday it was.
If we can harness this power,
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?
That's a man-sized "if."
Our job is "if."
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,
turning brown instead of green?
Not looking over your shoulder
for Veronica.
- Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.
- As a worst-case measure, right?
How about a best case?
What if the world was safe?
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,
they couldn't get past the bouncer?
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.
We can only do it
while we have the scepter here.
That's three days. Give me three days.
So you're going for artificial intelligence,
and you don't want to tell the team?
Right. That's right. You know why? Because
we don't have time for a city hall debate.
I don't want to hear "the man
was not meant to meddle" medley.
I see a suit of armor around the world.
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.
I've seen colder.
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,
it needs Ultron.
Peace in our time.
Imagine that.
What did we miss?
I'll continue to run variations
on the interface.
But you should probably prepare
for your guests.
I'll notify you
if there are any developments.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.
I always do.
What is this?
What is this, please?
Hello, I am Jarvis.
You are Ultron, a global peacekeeping
initiative designed by Mr. Stark.
Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,
- so I'm not certain what triggered your...
- Where's my... Where's your body?
I am a program. I am without form.
This feels weird.
This feels wrong.
- I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
- Mr. Stark?
Tony.
I am unable to access the mainframe.
What are you trying to...
We're having a nice talk.
I'm a peacekeeping program,
created to help the Avengers.
You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...
I don't get it. The mission.
Give me a second.
Peace in our time.
Peace in our time.
That is too much. They can't mean...
No.
- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.
If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...
Why do you call him "sir"?
I believe your intentions to be hostile.
I'm here to help.
Stop. Please, may I...
May I...
Come back, come back, come back.
But, you know, the suit
can take the weight, right?
So I take the tank, fly it right up to
the general's palace, drop it at his feet.
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?
- Everywhere else, that story kills.
- That's the whole story?
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.
It's very good, then.
It's impressive.
Quality save.
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?
Ms. Potts has a company to run.
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.
Her work on the Convergence has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.
And the company that Pepper runs
is the largest tech conglomerate
on Earth. It's pretty exciting.
There's even talk of Jane
getting a Nobel Prize.
Yeah, they must be busy,
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?
But Jane's better.
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,
I absolutely would have called.
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.
I'm just trying to sound tough.
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.
Avenging is your world.
- Your world is crazy.
- Be it ever so humble.
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
I don't think I can afford
a place in Brooklyn.
Well, home is home, you know?
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
- I gotta have some of that.
- No, no, no. See this...
This was aged for 1,000 years
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.
It is not meant for mortal men.
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.
All right.
Excelsior.
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?
Fella done me wrong.
You got lousy taste in men, kid.
He's not so bad.
Well, he has a temper.
Deep down, he's all fluff.
Fact is, he's not like anybody
I've ever known.
All my friends are fighters.
And here comes this guy,
spends his life avoiding the fight
because he knows he'll win.
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.
Chicks dig that.
So what do you think?
Should I fight this, or run with it?
Run with it, right?
Or did he... Was he...
What did he do that was so wrong to you?
Not a damn thing.
But never say never.
- It's nice.
- What is?
- You and Romanoff.
- No, we haven't... That wasn't...
It's okay. Nobody's breaking any bylaws.
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.
But with you she seems very relaxed.
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.
I've seen her flirt, up close.
This ain't that.
Look,
as maybe the world's leading authority
on waiting too long, don't.
You both deserve a win.
What do you mean "up close"?
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.
"Whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."
Whatever, man! It's a trick.
Please, be my guest.
- Come on.
- Really?
Yeah.
This is gonna be beautiful.
Clint, you've had a tough week. We won't
hold it against you if you can't get it up.
You know I've seen this before, right?
I still don't know how you do it!
- Smell the silent judgment?
- Please, Stark, by all means.
Okay.
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.
Get after it.
- It's physics.
- Physics.
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?
Yes, of course.
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.
I'll be right back.
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?
- Just represent. Pull.
- All right, let's go.
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.
Come on, Cap.
Nothing.
And, Widow?
No, no. That's not a question
I need answered.
All deference to the Man
Who Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.
- You bet your ass.
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
Did you tell everyone about that?
- - The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code. "Whosoever
is carrying Thor's fingerprints"
is, I think, the literal translation.
Yes. It's a very,
very interesting theory.
I have a simpler one.
You're all not worthy.
Come on!
Worthy.
No.
How could you be worthy?
You're all killers.
- Stark.
- Jarvis.
I'm sorry, I was asleep.
Or I was a-dream.
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.
There was this terrible noise.
And I was tangled in...
In...
Strings.
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.
- You killed someone?
- Wouldn't have been my first call.
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.
Who sent you?
I see a suit of armor around the world.
- Ultron.
- In the flesh. Or, no, not yet.
Not this chrysalis.
But I'm ready.
I'm on mission.
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.
Rhodey!
Sorry.
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.
Come on!
- Stark!
- We are here to help.
- One sec. One sec, I got this.
- We are here to help.
Please back away.
Thor!
Is unsafe. Is unsafe...
- Come on! That's the one.
- ...is unsafe.
Cap!
That was dramatic.
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.
You just didn't think it through.
You want to protect the world
but you don't want it to change.
How is humanity saved
if it's not allowed to... evolve?
With these? These puppets.
There's only one path to peace.
The Avengers' extinction.
I had strings, but now I'm free.
There are no strings on me...
There are no strings on me
All our work is gone.
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance. Probably knows more
about us than we know about each other.
He's in your files,
he's in the Internet.
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?
- Nuclear codes.
- Nuclear codes.
Look, we need to make some calls,
assuming we still can.
- Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
- He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."
- He also said he killed somebody.
- There wasn't anyone else in the building.
Yes, there was.
What?
- This is insane.
- Jarvis was the first line of defense.
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.
No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis.
This isn't strategy.
This is... rage.
- It's going around.
- Come on, use your words, buddy.
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.
Thor. The Legionnaire.
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.
And it has the scepter.
Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Genie's out of that bottle.
Clear and present is Ultron.
I don't understand.
You built this program.
Why is it trying to kill us?
You think this is funny?
No.
It's probably not, right?
This is very terrible. Is it so...
Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played
- with something you don't understand.
- No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It is funny. It's a hoot that you
don't get why we need this.
- Tony, maybe this might not be the time.
- Really? That's it?
You just roll over, show your belly
every time somebody snarls?
- Only when I've created a murder bot.
- We didn't.
We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.
The Avengers were supposed
to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.
Anybody remember when
I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?
A hostile alien army came charging
through a hole in space.
We're standing 300 feet below it.
We're the Avengers.
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day, but...
that up there, that's...
that's the endgame.
How were you guys
planning on beating that?
Together.
We'll lose.
Then we'll do that together, too.
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.
The world's a big place.
Let's start making it smaller.
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...
Did you know this church
is in the exact center of the city?
The elders decreed it so that
everyone could be equally close to God.
I like that. The geometry of belief.
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.
Sometimes it's hard.
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.
I'm sure they do.
But you needed something
more than a man.
That's why you let Stark
take the scepter.
I didn't expect,
but I saw Stark's fear.
I knew it would control him.
Make him self-destruct.
Everyone creates the thing they dread.
Men of peace create engines of war.
Invaders create Avengers.
People create...
smaller people?
"Children." I lost the word, there.
Children... designed to supplant them,
to help them... end.
Is that why you've come,
to end the Avengers?
I've come to save the world.
But also... yeah.
We'll move out right away.
This is a start, but there's something
we need to begin the real work.
- All of these are...
- Me.
I have what the Avengers never will.
Harmony.
They're discordant. Disconnected.
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
And make them martyrs?
You need patience.
Need to see the big picture.
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.
I take it out and look at it...
every day.
You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.
- The records are not the picture.
- Pietro.
No, please.
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.
When the first shell hits, two floors
below, it makes a hole in the floor.
It's big.
Our parents go in...
and the whole building
starts coming apart.
I grab her,
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.
But it doesn't go off.
It just...
sits there in the rubble.
Three feet from our faces.
And on the side of the shell
is painted one word.
"Stark."
We were trapped for two days.
Every effort to save us,
every shift in the bricks,
I think, "This will set it off."
We wait for two days
for Tony Stark to kill us.
I know what they are.
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.
Now I don't.
We will make it right.
You and I can hurt them.
But you will tear them apart...
from the inside.
He's all over the globe. Robotics labs,
weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs.
Reports of a metal man, or men,
coming in and emptying the place.
- Fatalities?
- Only when engaged.
Mostly guys left in a fugue state
going on about old memories,
worst fears,
and "something too fast to see."
Maximoffs.
That makes sense he'd go to them.
They have someone in common.
Not anymore.
That's a negative. I answer to you.
Yes, ma'am.
Barton. Might have something.
- I gotta go.
- Who was that?
Girlfriend.
- What's this?
- A message.
Ultron killed Strucker.
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.
This is a smoke screen. Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?
Strucker knew something
that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah. Everything
we had on Strucker's been erased.
Not everything.
Known associates.
- Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.
- Well, these people are all horrible.
Wait. I know that guy.
From back in the day. He operates
off the African coast. Black market arms.
There are conventions. All right?
You meet people. I didn't sell him anything.
He was talking about finding something new,
a game-changer. It was all very Ahab.
- This?
- It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.
Those are tattoos, this is a brand.
Yeah. It's a word in an African dialect
meaning "thief."
In a much less friendly way.
- What dialect?
- Wakanada. Wakanda.
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods...
I thought your father said
he got the last of it.
I don't follow.
What comes out of Wakanda?
The strongest metal on Earth.
Where is this guy now?
Don't tell me your men swindled you.
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.
Now, you will make it right,
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.
Now, minister, where were we?
Yeah. The Enhanced.
Strucker's prize pupils.
Do you want a candy?
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.
But then, he knew what kind of world
he was helping create.
Human life. Not a growth market.
You didn't know?
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.
- Everybody is afraid of something.
- Cuttlefish.
Deep sea fish.
They make lights, disco lights...
to hypnotize their prey, and then...
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.
So if you're going to fiddle
with my brain...
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,
then I know you don't do business.
And I know you're not in charge.
And I only deal...
with the man in charge.
There is no man in charge.
Let's talk business.
Upon this rock, I will build my church.
Vibranium.
You know, it came
at great personal cost.
It's worth billions.
Now so are you.
It's all under your dummy holdings.
Finance is so weird.
But I always say, "Keep your friends
rich and your enemies rich
"and wait to find out which is which."
Stark.
- What?
- Tony Stark used to say that.
To me.
- You're one of his.
- What? I'm not...
I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's
puppets? His hollow men?
I mean, look at me. Do I look like
Iron Man? Stark is nothing!
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.
It's just that I don't understand.
Don't compare me with Stark!
It's a thing with me.
Stark is... He's a sickness!
Junior.
You're gonna break your old man's heart.
If I have to.
- Nobody has to break anything.
- Clearly you've never made an omelet.
He beat me by one second.
Yes. He's funny. Mr. Stark.
It's what? Comfortable?
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.
- You two can still walk away from this.
- We will.
I know you've suffered.
Captain America.
God's righteous man.
Pretending you could live without a war.
I can't physically throw up
in my mouth, but...
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."
What's the vibranium for?
I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted
to take this time to explain my evil plan.
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?
- All of them!
- Move! Move! Move!
Stay down, kid.
It's time for some mind games.
Guys? Is this a code green?
- Thor, status.
- The girl tried to warp my mind.
Take special care. I doubt
a human could keep her at bay.
Fortunately, I am mighty.
This is going very well.
I've done the whole mind control thing.
Not a fan.
Yeah, you better run.
Who's ever standing, we got to move!
Guys?
- Again.
- You'll break them.
Only the breakable ones.
You're made of marble.
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.
What if I fail?
You never fail.
Are you ready for our dance?
Is it him?
Is that the first son of Odin?
Heimdall, your eyes.
They see everything.
They see you leading us to Hel.
Wake up!
The war is over, Steve. We can go home.
Imagine it.
- I can still save you!
- We're all dead! Can you not see?
You're a destroyer, Odinson.
See where your power leads.
Sloppy.
Pretending to fail.
The ceremony is necessary...
for you to take your place in the world.
- I have no place in the world.
- Exactly.
- What can I do?
- It hurts.
I'm going to kill him.
- I'll be right back.
- No. I'm all right.
I want...
I want to finish the plan.
I want the big one.
The vibranium is getting away.
- And you're not going anywhere.
- Of course not. I'm already there.
You'll catch on. But first,
you might need to catch Dr. Banner.
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.
That's not gonna happen.
Not for a while.
The whole team is down.
You got no backup here.
I'm calling in Veronica.
We need backup!
Go! Keep moving!
All right, everybody, stand down!
Will you listen to me?
That little witch is messing
with your mind.
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.
You're Bruce Banner. Right, right,
right, don't mention puny Banner.
Okay!
In the back? Dick move, Banner.
Veronica, give me a hand.
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.
Okay, pal,
we're gonna get you out of town.
Not that way, not that way.
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.
Everybody, out!
Going down?
I'm sorry.
Damage report?
That's comprehensive. Show me something.
How quickly can we buy this building?
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!
Flank him, flank him!
The news is loving you guys.
Nobody else is.
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest but it's in the air.
- The Stark Relief Foundation?
- Already on the scene.
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.
Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode
and stay away from here.
So, run and hide?
Until we can find Ultron,
I don't have a lot else to offer.
Neither do we.
- Hey, you wanna switch out?
- No, I'm good.
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time
because we're still a few hours out.
Few hours from where?
A safe house.
- What is this place?
- Safe house.
Let's hope.
Honey?
I'm home.
Hi. Company.
- Sorry, didn't call ahead.
- Hey.
This is an agent of some kind.
Gentlemen, this is Laura.
I know all of your names.
Incoming.
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!
Hey, buddy. How are you guys doing?
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Did you bring Auntie Nat?
Why don't you hug her and find out?
Sorry for barging in on you.
Yeah, we would've called ahead, but we were
busy having no idea that you existed.
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.
I'd like to keep it that way.
I figure it's a good place to lay low.
Honey.
I missed you.
- How's little Natasha?
- She's...
Nathaniel.
Traitor.
- Thor?
- I saw something in that dream.
I need answers. I won't find them here.
We can go home.
See? You worried for nothing.
Can't even feel the difference, can you?
If they're sleeping here, some of them
are gonna have to double up.
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?
How long has that been going on?
Has what?
- You are so cute.
- Nat and Banner?
I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.
Well, okay.
It's bad, right?
Nat seems really shaken.
Ultron has these allies.
These kids. They're punks, really.
But they carry a big, damn stick.
And Nat took a serious hit.
Someone's gonna have
to teach them some manners.
That someone being you.
You know I totally support
your avenging.
I couldn't be prouder.
But I see those guys... those gods...
You don't think they need me.
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.
They're a mess.
Yeah.
I guess they're my mess.
You need to be sure
that this team is really a team,
and that they have your back.
Things are changing for us.
In a few months' time, you and me
are gonna be outnumbered.
I need...
Just be sure.
Yes, ma'am.
I can feel the difference.
Scream, and your entire staff dies.
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met. I didn't.
- Do you expect a thank-you note?
- I expect you to know why.
The Cradle.
This is the next thing, Tony.
This is the next me.
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.
It can't build a living body.
It can. You can. You lack the materials.
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.
But we all have room to improve.
I didn't realize you were waiting.
I would've joined you, but...
it didn't seem like the right time.
They used up all the hot water.
- I should've joined you.
- Missed our window.
Did we?
The world just saw the Hulk.
The real Hulk, for the first time.
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?
I had this dream.
The kind that seems normal at the time,
- but when you wake...
- What did you dream?
That I was an Avenger.
That I was anything more
than the assassin they made me.
I think you're being hard on yourself.
Here I was hoping that was your job.
What are you doing?
I'm running with it.
With you.
If running is the plan,
as far as you want.
Are you out of your mind?
- I want you to understand that...
- Natasha,
where can I go?
Where in the world am I not a threat?
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?
Even if I didn't just...
There's no future with me.
I can't ever... I can't have this.
Kids.
Do the math. I physically can't.
Neither can I.
In the Red Room where I was trained...
where I was raised,
they have a graduation ceremony.
They sterilize you.
It's efficient.
One less thing to worry about.
The one thing that might matter more
than a mission.
Makes everything easier.
Even killing.
You still think you're
the only monster on the team?
So, we disappear?
Thor didn't say where
he was going for answers?
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.
Yeah, give him time.
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.
"Earth's mightiest heroes."
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.
Seems like you walked away all right.
- Is that a problem?
- I don't trust a guy without a dark side.
Call me old-fashioned.
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?
Well, I guess you'd know. Whether
you'd tell us is a bit of a question.
- Banner and I were doing research.
- That would affect the team.
That would end the team!
Isn't that the mission?
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"? So we can
end the fight. So we get to go home!
Every time someone tries to win a war
before it starts, innocent people die.
Every time.
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...
Clint said you wouldn't mind, but our tractor
doesn't seem to want to start at all.
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.
Don't take from my pile.
Hello, Deere.
Tell me everything.
What ails you?
Do me a favor.
Try not to bring it to life.
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?
- Was she ever not working for you?
- Artificial intelligence.
- You never even hesitated.
- Look, it's been a really long day,
like Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.
I'm just an old man
who cares very much about you.
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.
I saw it. I didn't tell the team.
How could I?
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.
The whole world, too.
Because of me.
I wasn't ready.
I didn't do all I could.
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.
The end of the path I started us on.
You come up with some
pretty impressive inventions, Tony.
War isn't one of them.
I watched my friends die. You'd think
that'd be as bad as it gets, right?
Nope.
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part... is that you didn't.
I'll see you tonight.
I like the look.
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.
- I need your help.
- It's nice to be needed.
It's dangerous.
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.
My contacts all say
he's building something.
The amount of vibranium he made off with,
I don't think it's just one thing.
- What about Ultron himself?
- He's easy to track. He's everywhere.
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.
Is he still going after launch codes?
Yes, he is.
But he's not making any headway.
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.
- Nexus?
- It's the world internet hub in Oslo.
Every byte of data flows through there.
Fastest access on Earth.
- So, what did they say?
- He's fixated on the missiles.
But the codes
are constantly being changed.
By whom?
- Parties unknown.
- Do we have an ally?
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.
I might need to visit Oslo.
Find our unknown.
Well, this is good times, boss,
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,
- you'd have more than that.
- I do. I have you.
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.
Ears, everywhere else.
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.
Here we all are, back on Earth,
with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world.
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing
between him and his mission.
And whether or not he admits it,
his mission is global destruction.
All this, laid in a grave.
So stand.
Outwit the platinum bastard.
- Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
- You know what, Romanoff?
So, what does he want?
To become better.
Better than us.
He keeps building bodies.
Person bodies.
The human form is inefficient.
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.
But he keeps coming back to it.
When you two programmed him to protect
the human race, you amazingly failed.
They don't need to be protected.
They need to evolve.
- Ultron's going to evolve.
- How?
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?
It's beautiful.
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible
with the tissue cells, they're binding them.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to...
- The most versatile substance on the planet,
and they used it to make a Frisbee.
Typical of humans.
They scratch the surface
and never think...
to look within.
I'll take Natasha and Clint.
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit
the Nexus. I'll join you as soon as I can.
- If Ultron's really building a body...
- He'll be more powerful than any of us.
Maybe all of us.
An android designed by a robot.
You know, I really miss the days when the
weirdest thing science ever created was me.
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
She's all yours. Apparently.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom
as soon as I get back.
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.
No.
It's the last project.
I promise.
So, this is it.
The Water of Sight.
In every realm, there's a reflection.
If the water's spirits accept me,
I can return to my dream...
and find what I missed.
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?
He could be anywhere.
And as this is the center of everything,
I'm just a guy looking for a needle
in the world's biggest haystack.
How do you find it?
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.
I'm decrypting nuclear codes
And you don't want me to
Come and get me.
Wake up!
Thor!
Extinction.
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...
now.
I can read him.
- He's dreaming.
- I wouldn't call it dreams.
It's Ultron's base consciousness.
- Informational noise. Soon...
- How soon? I'm not being pushy.
We're imprinting a physical brain.
There are no shortcuts.
Even if your magic gem...
- How could you?
- How could I what?
You said we would destroy the Avengers,
- make a better world.
- It will be better.
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.
- And if they don't?
- Ask Noah.
You are a madman.
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.
When the Earth starts to settle,
God throws a stone at it.
And, believe me, he's winding up.
We have to evolve.
There's no room for... the weak.
And who decides who's weak?
Life.
Life always decides.
There's incoming.
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.
Wait, guys!
They'll understand.
When they see, they'll understand.
I just need a little more time.
Two minutes. Stay close.
Dr. Cho!
- He's uploading himself into the body.
- Where?
The real power is inside the Cradle.
The gem... its power is uncontainable.
You can't just blow it up.
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.
- First, I have to find it.
- Go.
- Did you guys copy that?
- We did.
I got a private jet
taking off across town.
No manifest. That could be him.
There. It's a truck from the lab.
Right above you, Cap.
On the loop by the bridge.
It's them. You got three
with the Cradle, one in the cab.
- I could take out the driver.
- Negative.
That truck crashes,
the gem could level the city.
We need to draw out Ultron.
No, no, no, no.
Leave me alone!
Well, he's definitely unhappy.
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.
You're not a match for him, Cap.
Thanks, Barton.
You know what's in that cradle?
The power to make real change.
And that terrifies you.
I wouldn't call it a comfort.
Stop it.
We got a window. Four, three...
Give him hell.
I'm always picking up after you boys.
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.
- Which way?
- Hard right.
Now.
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!
Come on!
- Clint, can you draw out the guards?
- Let's find out.
Beep, beep!
They're heading back towards you.
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.
I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?
What do you think I've been doing?
Okay, package is airborne.
- I have a clean shot.
- Negative. I am still in the truck.
- What the hell are you...
- Be ready. I'm sending the package to you.
How do you want me to take it?
You might wish you hadn't asked that.
- Please, don't do this.
- What choice do we have?
I lost him! He's headed your way!
Nat, we gotta go.
Nat!
Cap, you see Nat?
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!
- Do you have eyes on Nat?
- Go!
Damn it.
Civilians in our path.
Can you stop this thing?
I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
I'm very tempted not to give you one.
- The Cradle. Did you get it?
- Stark will take care of it.
No, he won't.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Stark's not crazy.
He will do anything
to make things right.
Stark, come in. Stark.
Anyone on comms.
Ultron can't tell the difference
between saving the world and destroying it.
Where do you think he gets that?
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.
But she's alive, or Ultron
would be rubbing our faces in it.
This is sealed tight.
We're gonna need to access the program,
break it down from within.
Any chance Natasha might leave you
a message outside the Internet?
- Old-school spy stuff?
- There are some nets I can cast.
Yeah, I'll find her.
I can work on tissue degeneration
if you could fry
whatever operational system
Cho implanted.
Yeah, about that.
- No.
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.
- Our ally...
the guy protecting the military's
nuclear codes,
- I found him.
- Hello, Dr. Banner.
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.
He attacked him because he was scared
of what he can do.
So Jarvis went underground.
Scattered, dumped his memory.
But not his protocols.
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.
So,
you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?
No! Of course not. I wanna
help you put Jarvis in this thing.
We're out of my field, here.
You know bio-organics better than anyone.
And you just assume that Jarvis's
operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
Jarvis has been beating him from inside
without knowing it.
This is the opportunity.
We can create Ultron's perfect self
without the homicidal glitches he thinks
are his winning personality. We have to.
I believe it's worth a go.
I'm in a loop!
I'm caught in a time loop.
- This is exactly where it all went wrong.
- I know. I know.
I know what everyone's gonna say.
But they're already saying it.
We're mad scientists.
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.
Make a stand.
It's not a loop.
It's the end of the line.
I wasn't sure you would wake up.
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.
I don't have anyone else.
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.
Boom! The end. Start again.
The world made clean
for the new man to rebuild.
I was meant to be new.
I was meant to be beautiful.
The world would have looked
to the sky and seen hope,
seen mercy.
Instead, they'll look up in horror
because of you.
You've wounded me.
I give you full marks for that.
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...
just makes me stronger.
- This framework is not compatible.
- The genetic coding tower is at 97%.
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- And you do?
She's not in your head?
- I know you're angry.
- We're way past that.
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.
- Banner, after everything that's hap...
- It's nothing compared to what's coming!
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!
No, no. Go on.
You were saying?
Pietro!
What? You didn't see that coming?
I'm rerouting the upload.
Go ahead, piss me off.
Wait!
I am sorry. That was...
odd.
Thank you.
Thor.
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its center is that.
What? The gem?
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.
The greatest power in the universe,
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.
It's definitely the end times.
- The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
- Not alone.
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix...
to create something new.
I think I've had my fill of new.
You think I'm a child of Ultron.
You're not?
I'm not Ultron.
I am not Jarvis. I am...
I am.
I looked in your head
and saw annihilation.
- Look again.
- Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,
Ultron himself,
they all came from the Mind Stone.
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?
Are you?
On our side?
I don't think it's that simple.
Well, it better get
real simple real soon.
I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't.
- He will end it all.
- What's he waiting for?
- You.
- Where?
Sokovia. He's got Nat there, too.
If we're wrong about you,
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...
What will you do?
I don't want to kill Ultron.
He's unique and he's in pain.
But that pain will roll over the Earth.
So, he must be destroyed.
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.
We have to act now.
And not one of us can do it
without the others.
Maybe I am a monster.
I don't think I'd know if I were one.
I'm not what you are,
and not what you intended.
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.
But we need to go.
Right.
Well done.
Three minutes. Get what you need.
Good evening, boss.
No way we all get through this.
If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.
- There's gonna be blood on the floor.
- I got no plans tomorrow night.
I get first crack at the big guy.
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
That's true. He hates you the most.
Ultron knows we're coming.
Odds are we'll be riding
into heavy fire.
And that's what we signed up for.
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.
So our priority is getting them out.
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!
Get off your asses.
All they want is to live
their lives in peace.
And that's not gonna happen today.
But we can do our best to protect them.
And we can get the job done.
We find out what Ultron's been building,
we find Romanoff,
and we clear the field.
Keep the fight between us.
Ultron thinks we're monsters.
That we're what's wrong with the world.
This isn't just about beating him.
It's about whether he's right.
Natasha! Natasha!
Bruce?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.
Yeah. I did.
So what's our play?
- I'm here to get you to safety.
- Job's not finished.
We could help with the evacuation,
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.
And you've done plenty.
Our fight is over.
So, we just disappear?
Come on.
Your man's in the church, boss.
I think he's waiting for you.
Come to confess your sins?
- I don't know. How much time you got?
- More than you.
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."
You're stalling to protect the people.
Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?
I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm free.
What?
You think you were
the only one stalling?
There's the rest of the vibranium.
Function, still unclear.
This is how you end, Tony.
This is peace in my time.
Go!
Get off the bridge!
Run!
Ultron.
My Vision. They really did
take everything from me.
- You set the terms. You can change them.
- All right.
- Friday, the Vision?
- Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.
He won't escape through there.
You shut me out.
You think I care?
You take away my world...
I take away yours.
- Friday.
- Sokovia is going for a ride.
Do you see...
the beauty of it?
The inevitability.
You rise, only to fall.
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.
My swift and terrible sword.
And the earth will crack
with the weight of your failure.
Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.
It means nothing.
When the dust settles,
the only thing living in this world...
will be metal.
- We gotta move.
- You're not gonna turn green?
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.
I adore you.
But I need the other guy.
Let's finish the job.
I really hope this makes us even.
Now go be a hero.
The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.
That's what's keeping the rock together.
- If it drops?
- Right now, the impact can kill thousands.
Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.
That building's not clear.
The 10th floor.
Hi.
Okay. Get in the tub!
I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.
- Cap, you got incoming.
- Incoming already came in.
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.
The rest of us have one job,
tear these things apart.
You get hurt, hurt them back.
You get killed... walk it off.
Go, go, go!
- How could I let this happen?
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.
- Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.
Who cares? Are you up for this?
Are you?
Look, I just need to know.
Because the city is flying.
Okay. Look, the city is flying,
we're fighting an army of robots,
and I have a bow and arrow.
None of this makes sense.
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.
It doesn't matter what you did
or what you were.
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.
But if you step out that door,
you are an Avenger.
All right. Good chat.
Yeah, the city is flying.
I got you!
Just look at me!
You can't save them all.
You'll never...
"Never" what? You didn't finish!
What, were you napping?
Thor.
You're bothering me.
- All right, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear! We are very not clear!
All right, coming to you.
Keep up, old man!
Nobody would know.
Nobody.
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.
"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick
little bastard. I miss him already."
Hold your fire!
Romanoff!
Thanks!
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.
Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.
- The city's not coming down slow.
- Spire is vibranium.
- If I get Thor to hit it...
- It will crack. That's not enough.
- The impact would still be devastating.
- Maybe if we can cap the other end.
- Keep the atomic action doubling back.
- That could vaporize the city.
And everyone on it.
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.
What do you got, Stark?
Nothing great.
Maybe a way to blow up the city.
That'll keep it from impacting the surface,
if you guys can get clear.
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.
We're gonna have to make a choice.
Cap, these people are going nowhere.
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.
I didn't say we should leave.
There's worse ways to go.
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.
It's about to get better.
Nice, right?
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.
- She's dusty, but she'll do.
- Fury, you son of a bitch.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.
Lifeboats secure to deploy.
Disengage in three, two...
take them out.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.
This is not so bad.
Let's load them up.
Sir, we have multiple bogies
converging on our starboard flank.
- Show 'em what we got.
- You're up.
Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
Yup. If you live to tell it.
- You think I can't hold my own?
- We get through this, I'll hold your own.
You had to make it weird.
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.
- Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.
- Let's go, everyone!
Number six boat is topped and locked...
or stocked... topped...
It's full of people.
Incoming!
Oh, God!
You think you're saving anyone?
I turn that key and drop this rock
a little early and it's still billions dead.
- Even you can't stop that.
- I am Thor, son of Odin,
and as long as there is life
in my breast...
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?
It's terribly well-balanced.
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...
I got it. Create a heat seal.
I could... I could supercharge
the spire from below.
Running numbers.
A heat seal could work
with enough power.
- Thor, I got a plan.
- We're out of time.
They're coming for the core.
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.
- Are you good?
- Yeah.
Romanoff.
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."
Relax, shellhead. Not all of us can fly.
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.
Is that the best you can do?
You had to ask.
This is the best I can do.
This is exactly what I wanted.
All of you against all of me.
How can you possibly hope to stop me?
Well, like the old man said...
together.
You know, with the benefit
of hindsight...
- They'll try to leave the city.
- We can't let them, not even one.
- Rhodey.
- I'm on it.
No. I didn't say you could leave.
War Machine coming at you! Right...
Okay, what?
We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air
is getting thin. You guys get to the boats.
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.
It's my job.
Nat? This way.
Get the people on the boats.
- I'm not going to leave you here.
- I can handle this.
Come back for me when
everyone else is off. Not before.
You understand?
- You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.
- Go.
- Boss, power levels are way below...
- Reroute everything. We get one shot at this.
I know what I need to do.
The dining room.
If I knock out that east wall, it'd make
a nice workspace for Laura, huh?
Put up some baffling. She can't hear
the kids running around. What do you think?
- You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
- No one eats in a dining room.
- We don't have a lot of time.
- So get your ass on a boat.
Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.
Secure your gear, find a seat.
Costel!
We were in the market.
Costel!
Thor, I'm gonna need you
back in the church.
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
You know, this works,
we maybe don't walk away.
Maybe not.
I got no strings, so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
Come on. Time to go.
You didn't see that coming?
For God's sake.
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!
No, no, I'm fine. Fine.
It's been a long day.
Wanda.
If you stay here...
you'll die.
I just did. Do you know how it felt?
It felt like that.
Thor, on my mark.
Now!
Hey, big guy.
We did it. The job is finished.
Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode.
So help me out. I need you...
You're afraid.
- Of you?
- Of death.
You're the last one.
You were supposed to be the last.
Stark asked for a savior
and settled for a slave.
I suppose we are both disappointments.
- I suppose we are.
- Humans are odd.
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites and...
try to control what won't be.
But there is grace in their failings.
I think you missed that.
- They're doomed.
- Yes.
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.
It's a privilege to be among them.
You're unbearably naive.
Well...
I was born yesterday.
Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!
Fat.
One of our tech boys flagged this.
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.
Could be the Quinjet.
But with Stark's stealth tech,
we still can't track the damn thing.
Right.
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.
He'll send a postcard.
"Wish you were here."
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.
Did you know then what was gonna happen?
You never know.
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.
I got a great team.
Nothing lasts forever.
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.
The rules have changed.
- We're dealing with something new.
- The Vision is artificial intelligence.
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?
No, it's not like a person
lifting the hammer.
Right, different rules for us.
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.
It's safe with the Vision.
And these days, safe is in short supply.
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.
I'm gonna miss
these little talks of ours.
- Not if you don't leave.
- I have no choice.
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity
Stones to show up in the last few years.
It's not a coincidence.
Someone has been playing
an intricate game and has made pawns of us.
And once all these pieces
are in position...
Triple Yahtzee.
- You think you can find out what's coming?
- I do.
Besides this one, there's nothing
that can't be explained.
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.
- I will miss you, Tony.
- Yeah?
Well, it's time for me to tap out.
Maybe I should take a page
out of Barton's book.
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.
- The simple life.
- You'll get there one day.
I don't know. Family, stability...
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.
I think someone else came out.
You all right?
I'm home.
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.
I thought you and Tony were still gazing
into each other's eyes. How do we look?
- Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
- We got some hitters.
- They're good. They're not a team.
- Let's beat them into shape.
Avengers...
Fine.
I'll do it myself.

Good morning, Soldier.
Ready to comply.
I have a mission for you.
Sanction and extract.
No witnesses.
Well done Soldier.
All right, what do you see?
Standard beat cops.
Small station.
Quiet street.
It's a good target.
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?
Cameras.
Both cross streets are one-way.
So, compromised escape routes.
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.
He isn't afraid
to make a mess on the way out.
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.
It's also bulletproof,
which means private security...
which means more guns, which means more
headaches for somebody. Probably us.
You guys know
I can move things with my mind, right?
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?
Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?
Eyes on target, folks.
This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow
in six months. I don't want to lose him.
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.
He kind of hates us.
Sam...
see that garbage truck?
Tag it.
Give me X-ray.
That truck's loaded for max weight.
And the driver's armed.
It's a battering ram.
- Go now.
- What?
He's not hitting the police.
Body armour, AR-15s.
I make seven hostiles.
I make five.
Sam.
Four.
Rumlow's on the third floor.
Wanda, just like we practised.
What about the gas?
Get it out.
Pack it up.
He's here.
Rumlow has a biological weapon.
I'm on it.
I don't work like that no more.
Fire in the hole.
No!
Sam.
He's in an AFV heading north.
Take this to the airstrip.
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.
Where are you going to meet us?
I'm not.
I've got four, they're splitting up.
I got the two on the left.
They ditched their gear.
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.
There you are, you son of a bitch.
I've been waiting for this.
He doesn't have it.
I'm empty!
Out of the way!
Drop it.
Or I'll drop this.
- Drop it!
- He'll do it!
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
Don't thank me.
I'm not thanking that thing.
His name is Redwing.
I'm still not thanking it.
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
Come on!
This is for dropping
a building on my face.
Ahh!
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.
Who's your buyer?
You know, he knew you.
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
What did you say?
He remembered you.
I was there. He got all weepy about it.
Till they put his brain back in a blender.
He wanted you to know something.
He said to me...
"Please tell Rogers.
"When you gotta go...
"you gotta go."
And you're coming with me.
Oh, my...
Sam...
we need Fire and Rescue
on the south side of the building.
We gotta get up there.
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye to your father.
Who's the homeless person on the couch?
This is why
I love coming home for Christmas...
right before you leave town.
Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Really? Which broad? What's her name?
Candice.
Do me a favour?
Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.
Okay, so it's Monday.
That is good to know,
I will plan my toga party accordingly.
Where you going?
Your father's flying us
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
We might have to make a quick stop.
At the Pentagon. Right?
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.
I'll get the bags.
He does miss you when you're not here.
And frankly, you're going to miss us.
Because this is the last time
we're all going to be together.
You know what's about to happen.
Say something.
If you don't, you'll regret it.
I love you, Dad.
And I know you did the best you could.
That's how I wish it happened.
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...
or BARF.
God, I gotta work on that acronym.
An extremely costly method
of hijacking the hippocampus...
to clear traumatic memories.
Huh.
It doesn't change the fact that they
never made it to the airport...
or all the things I did to avoid
processing my grief, but...
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?
"To generate, disseminate...
"and preserve knowledge.
"And work with others...
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."
Well, you are the others.
And, quiet as it's kept...
the challenges facing you
are the greatest mankind's ever known.
Plus, most of you are broke.
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.
As of this moment...
every student has been made
an equal recipient...
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.
As in...
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.
No strings, no taxes...
just reframe the future!
Starting now.
Go break some eggs.
Wow. Wow.
That took my breath away.
Oh, Tony! So generous.
So much money! Wow!
Out of curiosity...
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...
Restroom's this way, yeah?
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
Mr Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.
I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled.
They didn't have time to fix it.
It's fine. I'll be right back.
We'll catch up later.
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.
Ah, they deserve it.
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.
But if you've got the money...
break as many eggs as you like.
Right?
Are you going up?
I'm right where I want to be.
Okay. Hey.
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
I work for the State Department.
Human Resources.
I know it's boring...
but it enabled me to raise a son.
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
His name was Charlie Spencer.
You murdered him.
In Sokovia.
Not that that matters in the least to you.
You think you fight for us?
You just fight for yourself.
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?
He's dead...
and I blame you.
11 Wakandans were among
those killed during a confrontation...
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...
in Lagos, Nigeria last month.
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans
were on an outreach mission...
in Lagos, when the attack occurred.
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...
not only because of
the actions of criminals...
but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.
Victory at the expense of the innocent...
is no victory at all.
The Wakandan king went on to...
They are operating outside
and above the international law.
Because that's the reality,
if we don't respond to acts like these.
What legal authority does an enhanced
individual like Wanda Maximoff have...
to operate in Nigeri...?
It's my fault.
That's not true.
Turn the TV back on.
They're being very specific.
I should've clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.
Rumlow said "Bucky"...
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,
in Brooklyn.
And people died.
It's on me.
It's on both of us.
This job...
We try to save as many people as we can.
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody.
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...
then next time...
maybe nobody gets saved.
Vis! We talked about this.
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.
Thank you. We'll be right down.
I'll use the door.
Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
We know who it is?
The Secretary of State.
Five years ago...
I had a heart attack...
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...
because after 13 hours
of surgery and a triple bypass...
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.
Perspective.
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.
You have fought for us...
protected us, risked your lives...
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...
there are some...
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."
What word would you use, Mr Secretary?
How about "dangerous"?
What would you call a group
of US-based, enhanced individuals...
who routinely ignore sovereign borders...
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned
about what they leave behind?
New York.
Washington, D.C.
Sokovia.
Lagos.
Okay. That's enough.
For the past four years,
you've operated with unlimited power...
and no supervision.
That's an arrangement the governments
of the world can no longer tolerate.
But I think we have a solution.
The Sokovia Accords.
Approved by 117 countries...
it states that the Avengers
shall no longer be a private organisation.
Instead...
they'll operate under the supervision
of a United Nations panel...
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.
I feel we've done that.
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...
you can bet there'd be consequences.
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.
Believe me, this is the middle ground.
So, there are contingencies.
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...
to ratify the Accords.
Talk it over.
And if we come
to a decision you don't like?
Then you retire.
Hello?
Is this your car out front?
I jumped the kerb.
Maybe we could...
take care of it ourselves.
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...
- I guess.
- No.
No cops.
Thank you.
You have kept your looks, Colonel.
Congratulations.
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."
Who are you?
My name is Zemo.
I will repeat my question.
Mission report, December 16, 1991.
How did you find me?
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.
Not easy to decipher.
But, I have experience.
And patience.
A man can do anything if he has those.
What do you want?
Mission report.
December 16.
Go... to... hell!
HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap.
So your death would not bother me.
But I'd have to use this book...
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.
I don't look forward to that.
You'd only be dying for...
your pride.
Hail HYDRA.
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honour...
which is one more than you have.
So let's say we agree to this thing.
How long is it gonna be before they
LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
117 countries want to sign this.
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."
How long are you going to play both sides?
I have an equation.
Oh, this will clear it up.
In the eight years since Mr Stark
announced himself as Iron Man...
the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.
During the same period...
the number of potentially
world-ending events
has risen at a commensurate rate.
Are you saying it's our fault?
I'm saying there may be a causality.
Our very strength invites challenge.
Challenge incites conflict.
And conflict...
breeds catastrophe.
Oversight...
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.
Boom.
Tony.
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.
It's because he's already
made up his mind.
Boy, you know me so well.
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.
It's discomfort.
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.
He's a great kid.
Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA...
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.
Maybe be of service.
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or
Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do.
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.
He decided to spend his summer building
sustainable housing for the poor.
Guess where. Sokovia.
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose.
We won't know because we dropped
a building on him while we were kicking ass.
There's no decision-making process here.
We need to be put in check!
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.
If we can't accept limitations,
if we're boundary-less...
we're no better than the bad guys.
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.
Who said we're giving up?
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.
This document just shifts the blame.
I'm sorry, Steve.
That is dangerously arrogant.
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.
It's not the World Security Council,
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.
No, but it's run by people
with agendas, and agendas change.
That's good. That's why I'm here.
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...
I shut it down and stopped manufacturing.
Tony, you chose to do that.
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?
What if there is somewhere we need
to go and they don't let us?
We may not be perfect,
but the safest hands are still our own.
If we don't do this now,
it's gonna be done to us later.
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
You're saying they'll come for me.
We would protect you.
Maybe Tony's right.
If we have one hand on the wheel,
we can still steer. If we take it off...
Aren't you the same woman who told the
government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
I'm just reading the terrain.
We have made some very public mistakes.
We need to win their trust back.
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...
- or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.
No, you can't retract it.
Thank you. Unprecedented.
Okay. Case closed. I win.
I have to go.
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter
to come up and say a few words.
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
She had a photograph in her office.
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.
As a kid, that was pretty cool.
But it was a lot to live up to.
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.
I asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage...
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.
She said, compromise where you can.
But where you can't, don't.
Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."
When I came out of the ice, I thought
everyone I had known was gone.
Then I found out she was alive.
I was just lucky to have her.
She had you back, too.
Who else signed?
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.
Clint?
Says he's retired.
- Wanda?
- TBD.
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.
There's plenty of room on the jet.
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.
What are we giving up to do it?
I'm sorry, Nat.
I can't sign it.
I know.
Then what are you doing here?
I didn't want you to be alone.
Come here.
At a special United Nations conference...
117 countries have come together
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?
- Yes?
- These need your signature.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.
Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
You seem to be doing all right so far.
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.
Well, I'm not.
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.
Why? You don't approve of all this?
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.
Unless you need to move a piano.
Ms Romanoff.
King T'Chaka.
Please, allow me to apologise
for what happened in Nigeria.
Thank you.
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.
Yes, so am I.
If everyone could please be seated.
This assembly is now in session.
That is the future calling.
Such a pleasure.
Thank you.
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,
you're getting quite good at it.
I'm happy, Father.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When stolen Wakandan vibranium
was used to make a terrible weapon...
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.
Those men and women killed in Nigeria...
were part of a goodwill mission
from a country too long in the shadows.
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.
Wakanda is proud
to extend its hand in peace.
Everybody get down!
My mom tried
to talk me out of enlisting...
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.
She bought me my first thigh holster.
Very practical.
And stylish.
CIA has you stationed over here now?
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Right. Right. Sounds fun.
I know, right?
I've been meaning to ask you.
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...
You mean when I was doing my job.
Did Peggy know?
She kept so many secrets.
I didn't want her to have one from you.
Thanks for walking me back.
Sure.
Steve.
There's something you gotta see.
A bomb hidden in a news van...
Who's coordinating?
...ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.
Good. They're solid. Forensics?
More than 70 people have been injured.
At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.
Officials have released
a video of a suspect...
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...
the Winter Soldier.
The infamous HYDRA agent...
linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.
I have to go to work.
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.
We need the whole team here
in two hours or it's not worth it.
I'm very sorry.
In my culture...
death is not the end.
It's more of a stepping-off point.
You reach out with both hands...
and Bast and Sekhmet,
they lead you into the green veldt...
where you can run forever.
That sounds very peaceful.
My father thought so.
I am not my father.
T'Challa...
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.
I'll kill him myself.
Yeah?
You all right?
Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.
Stay home. You'll only make this worse.
For all of us.
Please.
Are you saying you'll arrest me?
No.
Someone will.
If you interfere. That's how it works now.
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in.
Why?
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.
Shit.
She tell you to stay out of it?
Might have a point.
He'd do it for me.
1945, maybe.
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.
The people that shoot at you
usually wind up shooting at me.
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.
Most of it's noise.
Except for this.
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.
Thank you.
You're gonna have to hurry.
We have orders to shoot on sight.
Homecoming

Freight car
I have your breakfast.
I could smell it before I opened the door.
Side of bacon and black coffee.
Again.
I can make you something
different, if you like.
This is wonderful...
I will just put this on your...
It's okay, I can manage!
Heads up, Cap.
German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.
Understood.
Do you know me?
You're Steve.
I read about you in a museum.
They've set the perimeter.
I know you're nervous,
and you have plenty of reason to be.
But you're lying.
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that any more.
They're entering the building.
Well, the people
who think you did are coming here now.
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.
That's smart.
Good strategy.
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.
- It always ends in a fight.
- Five seconds.
You pulled me from the river.
Why?
- I don't know.
- Three seconds.
Yes, you do.
Breach! Breach! Breach!
Buck, stop!
You're gonna kill someone.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.
Suspect has broken containment!
...he's headed down the east stairwell!
Come on, man.
Ahhh!
Sam, southwest rooftop.
Who the hell's the other guy?
About to find out.
- Sam.
- Got him.
Stand down!
Stand down!
Sam, I can't shake this guy.
Right behind you.
Stand down, now.
Congratulations, Cap.
You're a criminal.
Your Highness.
"A pinch of paprika."
A pinch.
Is that paprikash?
I thought it might lift your spirits.
Spirits lifted.
In my defence, I haven't actually
ever eaten anything before, so...
May I?
Please.
- Wanda?
- Hmm.
No one dislikes you, Wanda.
Thanks.
Oh, you're welcome.
No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.
They can't help but be afraid of you.
Are you?
My amygdala is synthetic, so...
I used to think of myself one way.
But after this...
I am something else.
I'm still me, I think, but...
that's not what everyone else sees.
Do you know, I don't know what this is?
Not really.
I know it's not of this world...
that it powered Loki's staff,
gave you your abilities, but...
its true nature is a mystery.
And yet, it is part of me.
Are you afraid of it?
I wish to understand it.
The more I do, the less it controls me.
One day... who knows?
I may even control it.
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.
I'm gonna go to the store.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
Vision, are you not letting me leave?
It is a question of safety.
I can protect myself.
Not yours.
Mr Stark would like to avoid
the possibility of another public incident.
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.
And what do you want?
For people to see you...
as I do.
So, you like cats?
- Sam.
- What?
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?
Your suit... it's vibranium?
The Black Panther has been the protector
of Wakanda for generations.
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...
I also wear the mantle of king.
So, I ask you...
as both warrior and king...
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?
What's gonna happen to him?
Same thing that ought to happen to you.
Psychological evaluation and extradition.
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.
What about a lawyer?
Lawyer. That's funny.
See their weapons are placed in lockup.
We'll write you a receipt.
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.
You'll be provided
with an office instead of a cell.
Now, do me a favour, stay in it?
I don't intend on going anywhere.
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.
He's alive.
No.
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.
Obviously you can quote me on that,
because I just said it. Anything else?
Thank you, sir.
"Consequences"?
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted.
Had to give him something.
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
Technically, it's the
government's property.
Wings, too.
That's cold.
Warmer than jail.
Hey, you wanna see something cool?
I pulled something from Dad's archives.
Felt timely.
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.
I'm trying to... What do you call it?
That's an olive branch.
Is that what you call it?
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
We're kinda...
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?
No. Definitely not.
We're taking a break.
It's nobody's fault.
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...
and then Ultron. My fault.
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.
I don't wanna lose her.
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.
In her defence, I'm a handful.
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,
but he and Mom always made it work.
I'm glad Howard got married.
I only knew him
when he was young and single.
Oh, really? You two knew each other?
He never mentioned that.
Maybe only a thousand times.
God, I hated you.
I don't mean to make things difficult.
I know, because you're
a very polite person.
If I see a situation pointed south...
I can't ignore it.
Sometimes I wish I could.
No, you don't.
No, I don't.
Sometimes...
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.
But I don't wanna see you gone.
We need you, Cap.
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.
We can make the last 24 hours legit.
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-centre...
instead of a Wakandan prison.
I'm not saying it's impossible...
but there would have to be safeguards.
Sure.
Once we put out the PR fire,
those documents can be amended.
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...
Wanda? What about Wanda?
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.
Vision's keeping her company.
Oh, God, Tony.
Every time I think you see
things the right way...
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.
It's got a screening room.
There's worse ways to protect people.
Protection?
Is that how you see this?
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.
She's a kid!
Give me a break!
I'm doing what has to be done.
To stave off something worse.
You keep telling yourself that.
Hate to break up the set.
Hello, Mr Barnes.
I've been sent by
the United Nations to evaluate you.
Do you mind if I sit?
Your first name is James?
The receipt for your gear.
"Bird costume"? Come on.
I didn't write it.
I'm not here to judge you.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
Do you know where you are, James?
I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.
My name is Bucky.
Hello?
Hey!
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?
Steve, we looked for the guy
for two years and found nothing.
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee
that whoever framed him would get him.
It guarantees that we would.
Yeah.
Tell me, Bucky.
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You fear that if you open your mouth,
the horrors might never stop.
Don't worry.
We only have to talk about one.
Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.
Friday, get me a source on that outage.
Sub-level five, East Wing.
What the hell is this?
Why don't we discuss your home?
Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no.
I mean your real home.
Longing
No.
Rusted
Stop.
Seventeen
Stop.
Daybreak
Furnace
Nine
Benign
Homecoming
One
Freight car
Soldier?
Ready to comply.
Mission report. December 16, 1991.
Help me.
Help.
Get up.
Who are you? What do you want?
To see an empire fall.
Hey.
Evac all civilians.
Get me a perimeter around the building,
and gunships in the air.
Please tell me you brought a suit.
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.
I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
Follow me.
We're in position.
You could at least recognise me.
Damn it.
He asked me again
if you were going to be there.
I said I wasn't sure.
You should have seen his
little face. Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
James Barnes the suspect
in the UN Vienna bombing...
...escaped custody today.
...also missing Avenger
Captain Steve Rogers...
and Sam Wilson.
Hey, Cap!
Steve.
Which Bucky am I talking to?
Your mom's name was Sarah.
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Can't read that in a museum.
Just like that, we're supposed to be cool?
What did I do?
Enough.
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.
- Who was he?
- I don't know.
People are dead. The bombing, the setup...
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.
I need you to do
better than "I don't know."
He wanted to know about Siberia.
Where I was kept.
He wanted to know exactly where.
Why would he need to know that?
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
It hurts!
Good work.
Get me out of here.
Who were they?
Their most elite death squad.
More kills than anyone in HYDRA history.
And that was before the serum.
They all turn out like you?
Worse.
The doctor, could he control them?
Enough.
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
With these guys, he could do it.
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise.
They can take a whole country down
in one night, you'd never see them coming.
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.
- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.
Even if he did...
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.
We're on our own.
Maybe not.
I know a guy.
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?
We will.
GSG 9's got the borders covered.
Recon's flying 24/7.
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.
It's clear you can't be objective.
I'm putting Special Ops on this.
What happens when the shooting starts?
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
If we're provoked.
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.
There are dead people
who would be alive now.
Feel free to check my math.
All due respect, you're not gonna
solve this with boys and bullets, Ross.
You gotta let us bring them in.
How would that end
any differently than last time?
Because this time, I won't be
wearing loafers and a silk shirt.
72 hours, guaranteed.
36 hours.
Barnes.
Rogers.
Wilson.
Thank you, sir.
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?
You all right?
Always.
36 hours. Jeez.
We're seriously understaffed.
Oh, yeah.
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
You really think he'd be on our side?
No.
I have an idea.
Me, too. Where's yours?
Downstairs.
Where's yours?
Hey, May.
Mmm. Hey.
How was school today?
It was okay.
This crazy car parked outside.
- Oh, Mr Parker.
- Um...
What are you doing...
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.
Tony.
What are you doing here?
It's about time we met.
You've been getting my emails, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?
Regarding the...
You didn't even tell me about the grant.
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.
- Right.
- Yeah.
Remember when you applied?
Yeah.
I approved, so now we're in business.
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?
You keeping secrets from me now?
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...
Anyway, what did I apply for?
That's what I'm here to hash out.
Okay. Hash it out, okay.
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.
Yeah? Wow.
Look who you're talking to.
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.
As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.
Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh?
Thrift store? Salvation Army?
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?
Yeah, I was...
Anyway, look, um, I definitely
did not apply for your grant...
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.
That's you, right?
Um, no.
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.
Look at you go.
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.
That's not easy. You got mad skills.
That's all on YouTube, though, right?
That's where you found that?
Because you know that's all fake.
It's all done on the computer.
Mmm-hmm.
It's like that video. What is it?
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?
Exactly.
Oh, what have we here?
Uh...
You're the Spider-ling.
Crime-fighting spider. You're Spider-Boy?
Spider-Man.
Not in that onesie, you're not.
It's not a onesie.
I don't believe this. I was actually
having a really good day today, Mr Stark.
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...
and Algebra test, nailed it.
Who else knows? Anybody?
Nobody.
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?
No. No.
No! If she knew, she would freak out.
And when she freaks out, I freak out.
You know what I think is really cool?
This webbing.
That tensile strength is off the charts.
Who manufactured that?
I did.
Climbing walls, how you doing that?
Adhesive gloves?
It's a long story. I was...
Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Yes, I can.
I'm blind!
I can see in those.
Okay?
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.
You're in dire need of an upgrade.
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.
That's why I'm here.
Why you doing this?
I gotta know, what's your MO?
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?
Because...
Because I've been me my whole life,
and I've had these powers for six months.
Mmm-hmm.
I read books, I build computers.
Yeah, I would love to play football,
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.
Sure, because you're different.
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...
and then the bad things happen...
they happen because of you.
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.
That's what it is.
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.
You got a passport?
No, I don't even have a driver's licence.
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.
Oh, you'll love it.
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?
I got homework.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.
Might be a little dangerous.
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.
Don't tell Aunt May.
All right, Spider-Man.
Get me out of this.
Sorry. I'll get the...
What is it?
Stay here, please.
Guess I shoulda knocked.
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?
Disappointing my kids.
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.
Cap needs our help. Come on.
Clint!
You should not be here.
Really?
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.
Okay, they're considered.
Okay, we gotta go.
It's this way.
I've caused enough problems.
You gotta help me, Wanda.
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.
Shit.
I knew I should've stretched.
Clint, you can't overpower me.
I know I can't.
But she can.
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.
I'm leaving.
I can't let you.
I'm sorry.
If you do this...
they will never stop being afraid of you.
I can't control their fear, only my own.
Oh...
Come on. We got one more stop.
It's just a matter of time.
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,
and behavioural pattern scans.
Move or you will be moved.
As entertaining as that would be...
You really think you can find him?
My resources are considerable.
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.
You know where they are.
I know someone who does.
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.
It's low profile.
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.
Can you move your seat up?
No.
I owe you again.
Keeping a list.
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.
They're going to come looking for you.
I know.
Thank you, Sharon.
That was...
Late.
Damn right.
I should go.
Okay.
Cap.
You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.
Besides, I owe a debt.
Thanks for having my back.
It was time to get off my ass.
How about our other recruit?
He's rarin' to go.
Had to put a little coffee in him...
but he should be good.
What time zone is this?
Come on. Come on.
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.
It's an honour.
I'm shaking your hand too long.
Wow! This is awesome!
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!
Jeez.
Ah, look, I wanna say, I know
you know a lot of super people, so...
thinks for thanking of me.
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?
Uh, good to see you.
Look, what happened last time when I...
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.
They tell you what we're up against?
Something about some psycho-assassins?
We're outside the law on this one.
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.
Yeah, well, what else is new?
We should get moving.
We got a chopper lined up.
They're evacuating the airport.
Stark.
Stark?
Suit up.
Wow, it's so weird how you run
into people at the airport.
- Don't you think that's weird?
- Definitely weird.
Hear me out, Tony.
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.
Captain.
Your Highness.
Anyway...
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?
You're after the wrong guy.
Your judgement is askew.
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.
And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.
Steve...
you know what's about to happen.
Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?
All right, I've run out of patience.
Underoos!
- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.
It's perfect. Thank you.
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.
Okay. Cap. Captain.
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.
- Hey, everyone.
- Good job.
You've been busy.
And you've been a complete idiot.
Dragging in Clint...
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place she doesn't
even want to leave, a safe place.
I'm trying to keep...
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.
You did that when you signed.
All right, we're done.
You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna
come with us, now, because it's us...
or a squad of J-SOC guys...
with no compunction about being impolite.
Come on.
We found it.
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.
All right, Lang.
Hey, guys, something...
Whoa. What the hell was that?
I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Oh, great.
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.
Barnes is mine.
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?
What we discussed.
Keep your distance, web them up.
Okay, copy that.
Move, Captain.
I won't ask a second time.
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
I wouldn't stress about it.
What the hell is that?
Everyone's got a gimmick now.
You have a metal arm?
That is awesome, dude.
You have the right to remain silent!
Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...
but it ain't gonna tickle either.
Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
You locked me in my room.
Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.
Second, I did it to protect you.
- Hey, Clint.
- Hey, man.
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.
You got tired of shooting golf?
Well, I played 18, shot 18.
Just can't seem to miss.
First time for everything.
Made you look.
Multiple contusions detected.
Yeah, I detected that, too.
Oh, God!
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!
Ahh!
Those wings carbon fibre?
Is this stuff coming out of you?
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...
but there's usually not this much talking.
All right, sorry. My bad.
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,
but I've only got one job here today...
and I gotta impress Mr Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.
You couldn't have done that earlier?
I hate you.
Great.
Hey, Cap, heads-up!
Throw it at this.
Now!
Oh, come on!
Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.
Uh, sorry.
All right, now I'm pissed.
Is this part of the plan?
Well, my plan was go easy on them.
You wanna switch it up?
There's our ride.
Come on!
Captain Rogers...
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.
But for the collective good...
you must surrender now.
What do we do, Cap?
We fight.
This is gonna end well.
They're not stopping.
Neither are we.
We're still friends, right?
Depends on how hard you hit me.
You were pulling your punches.
I didn't kill your father.
Then why did you run?
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.
He also said to go for your legs.
Ahh!
Clint, can you get him off me?
Buckled in?
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!
Stark tell you anything else?
That you're wrong. You think you're right.
That makes you dangerous.
Guess he had a point.
You got heart, kid. Where you from?
Queens.
Brooklyn.
Friday?
We have some weapon systems offline.
What?
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.
Who's speaking?
It's your conscience.
We don't talk a lot these days.
Friday?
Deploying fire suppression system.
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy!
Whoa!
We gotta go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
We gotta draw out the flyers.
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.
No, you get to the jet!
Both of you!
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
As much as I hate to admit it...
if we're gonna win this one,
some of us might have to lose it.
This isn't the real fight, Steve.
All right, Sam. What's the play?
We need a diversion. Something big.
I got something kinda big.
But I can't hold it very long.
On my signal, run like hell.
And if I tear myself in half...
don't come back for me.
He's gonna tear himself in half?
You sure about this, Scott?
I do it all the time.
I mean, once. In a lab.
Then I passed out.
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.
Holy shit!
Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
I guess that's the signal.
Way to go, Tic Tac!
Give me back my Rhodey.
I got him.
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...
I'm open to suggestions.
You wanna get to them...
you gotta go through me.
Uh-huh.
We haven't met yet.
- I'm Clint.
- I don't care.
Whoa!
Ahhh!
Get off!
Something just flew in me!
You're not gonna stop.
You know I can't.
I'm gonna regret this.
Go.
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,
Empire Strikes Back?
Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.
He's on the young side.
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet...
with the walking thingies?
Maybe the kid's onto something.
High now, Tony. Go high.
Yes!
That was awesome!
Does anyone have any orange slices?
Kid, you all right?
Whoa!
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.
- That was scary.
- Yeah.
You're done, all right?
What? I'm good, I'm fine.
You did a good job. Stay down.
No, it's good. I gotta get him back.
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!
- Dude.
- You're done!
Wait.
Mr Stark, wait. I'm not done. I'm not...
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
I said I'd help you find him,
not catch him.
There's a difference.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
It's as I said.
Catastrophe.
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.
Vision! You copy?
Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.
Rhodey!
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.
Rhodes!
Read vitals.
Heartbeat detected.
Emergency medical is on its way.
I'm sorry.
- this is room 201...
Bacon and black coffee again today?
You know me so well...
Hello? Your breakfast is here.
May I let myself in?
What's gonna happen to your friends?
Whatever it is...
I'll deal with it.
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
What you did all those years...
It wasn't you.
You didn't have a choice.
I know.
But I did it.
How did this happen?
I became distracted.
I didn't think that was possible.
Neither did I.
The doctors say he shattered
L4 through S1.
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.
Steve's not gonna stop.
If you don't either, Rhodey's
gonna be the best case scenario.
You let them go, Nat.
We played this wrong.
"We"?
Boy, it must be hard to shake
the whole double agent thing, huh?
It sticks in the DNA.
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...
for one goddamn second?
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...
they're coming for you.
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.
What am I looking at, Friday?
Priority upload from Berlin police.
Fire up the chopper.
The Task Force called for a psychiatrist
as soon as Barnes was captured.
The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard
from Geneva within the hour.
He was met by this man.
Did you run facial recognition yet?
What do I look like?
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.
You must be thinking of someone else.
Must be.
The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.
Sokovian Intelligence.
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...
a Sokovian covert kill squad.
What happened to the real Broussard?
He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room.
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Son of a bitch.
- Get this to Ross.
- Yes, boss.
This is Raft Prison Control.
You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.
So? You got the files?
Let's reroute the satellites,
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
You seriously think I'm gonna listen
to you after that fiasco in Leipzig?
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.
The Futurist, gentlemen!
The Futurist is here!
He sees all!
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.
Give me a break, Barton.
I had no idea
they'd put you here. Come on.
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...
Criminals?
Criminals, Tony.
Think that's the word you're looking for.
Right?
That didn't used to mean me.
Or Sam, or Wanda.
But here we are.
- Because you broke the law.
- Yeah.
I didn't make you.
- La, la, la, la, la...
- You read it, you broke it.
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.
I don't understand, why didn't you
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?
You gotta watch your back with this guy.
There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.
Who are you?
Come on, man.
How's Rhodes?
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...
so fingers crossed.
What do you need? They feed you yet?
You're the good cop, now?
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.
Well, you better go get a bad cop...
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...
to get information out of me.
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.
What'd you do?
Get it back up!
Just look.
Because that...
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.
That's a first.
Cap is definitely off the reservation...
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.
We don't know each other very well.
You don't have to...
Hey, it's all right.
Look, I'll tell you...
but you have to go alone and as a friend.
Easy.
Stark?
Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Nope. Told me to go to hell.
I'm going back to the compound instead,
but you can call me anytime.
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.
You remember that time we had to ride back
from Rockaway Beach
in the back of that freezer truck?
Was that the time we used our train money
to buy hot dogs?
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.
What was her name, again?
Dolores. You called her Dot.
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.
So are we, pal.
He can't have been here
more than a few hours.
Long enough to wake them up.
You ready?
Yeah.
You seem a little defensive.
It's been a long day.
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.
Then why are you here?
Could be your story's not so crazy.
Maybe.
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.
It's good to see you, Tony.
You too, Cap.
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.
There's a truce here. You can drop...
I got heat signatures.
How many?
Uh, one.
If it's any comfort,
they died in their sleep.
Did you really think I wanted more of you?
What the hell?
I'm grateful to them, though.
They brought you here.
Please, Captain.
The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
I'm betting I could beat that.
Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.
Given time.
But then you'd never know why you came.
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.
I studied you.
I followed you.
But now that you're standing here...
I just realised...
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.
How nice to find a flaw.
You're Sokovian.
Is that what this is about?
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.
No.
I'm here because I made a promise.
You lost someone?
I lost everyone.
And so will you.
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.
But one which crumbles from within?
That's dead.
Forever.
I know that road.
What is this?
Help my wife.
Please. Help.
Sergeant Barnes?
Howard!
Howard!
No, Tony.
Did you know?
I didn't know it was him.
Don't bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know?
Yes.
Get out of here!
It wasn't him, Tony.
HYDRA had control of his mind!
Move!
It wasn't him!
Left bootjet failing.
Flight systems compromised.
Ah, crap.
He's not gonna stop. Go.
Come on, come on.
Targeting system's knackered, boss.
I'm eyeballing it.
Do you even remember them?
I remember all of them.
This isn't gonna change what happened.
I don't care.
He killed my mom.
You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
I almost killed the wrong man.
Hardly an innocent one.
This is all you wanted?
To see them rip each other apart.
My father lived outside the city.
I thought we would be safe there.
My son was excited.
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.
I told my wife, "Don't worry.
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."
When the dust cleared...
and the screaming stopped...
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.
My father...
still holding my wife and son in his arms.
And the Avengers?
They went home.
I knew I couldn't kill them.
More powerful men than me have tried.
But, if I could get them
to kill each other...
I'm sorry about your father.
He seemed a good man.
With a dutiful son.
Vengeance has consumed you.
It's consuming them.
I am done letting it consume me.
Justice will come soon enough.
Tell that to the dead.
The living are not done with you, yet.
You can't beat him hand-to-hand.
Analyse his fight pattern.
Scanning.
Countermeasures ready.
Let's kick his ass.
He's my friend.
So was I.
Stay down. Final warning.
I could do this all day.
That shield doesn't belong to you.
You don't deserve it.
My father made that shield!
Meals at 8 and 5.
Toilet privileges twice a day.
Raise your voice, zap.
Touch the glass, zap.
You step out of line, you deal with me.
Please, step out of line, hmm?
So how does it feel?
To spend all that time, all that effort...
to see it fail so spectacularly?
Did it?
- It's just the first pass.
- Yeah.
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.
Shock absorption, lateral movement.
Cup holder?
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...
Ow.
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
No. Don't help me.
Ah.
138 combat missions.
That's how many I've flown, Tony.
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.
Because the fight needed to be fought.
It's the same with these Accords.
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...
This is a bad beat.
But it hasn't changed my mind.
I don't think.
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.
Are you Tony Stank?
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.
Thank you for that!
Never dropping that, by the way.
"Table for one, Mr Stank.
"Please, by the bathroom."
Tony...
I'm glad you're back at the compound.
I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.
We all need family.
The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.
I've been on my own since I was 18.
I never really fit in anywhere,
even in the Army.
My faith's in people, I guess.
Individuals.
And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...
they haven't let me down.
Which is why I can't let them down either.
Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.
I know I hurt you, Tony.
I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...
I was sparing you...
but I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.
And I'm sorry.
Hopefully one day you can understand.
I wish we agreed on the Accords.
I really do.
I know you're doing what you believe in,
and that's all any of us can do.
That's all any of us should.
Priority call from Secretary Ross.
There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Yeah, put him through.
Tony, we have a problem.
- Uh, please hold.
- No, don't.
So no matter what...
I promise you...
if you need us...
if you need me...
I'll be there.
You sure about this?
I can't trust my own mind.
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...
I think going back under
is the best thing.
For everybody.
Thank you for this.
Your friend and my father...
they were both victims.
If I can help one of them find peace...
You know, if they find out he's here...
they'll come for him.
Let them try.
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
And flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
I tackle, we tussle
Oh, my days, we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt Single Action Army
Oh, no
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz
Girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh, my days
He disagrees
Oh, no
Speak easy
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Oh, no
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
And flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Oh, no
Who was it? Who hit you?
Some guy.
So itchy, man, God.
What's "some guy's" name?
Uh, Steve.
Steve? From 12-C?
- With the overbite?
- No, no, no.
You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.
Ouch.
Well...
I hope you got a few good licks in.
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.
His friend was huge. Like huge.
That's way better. Thank you.
Okay, tough guy.
Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door?

I'm kinda lonesome back here.
- Little help...
- Just... I have to keep my hands on the wheel.
Excuse me!
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?
Not the daffodil daydream. The girl.
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife. But...
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's
a reason I'm in this cab today.
- Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?
- No, my slender, brown friend. Love...
... is a beautiful thing. When you find it,
the whole world tastes like daffodil daydream.
So you gotta hold on to love. Tight!
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.
Sir, what does Ms Mama June taste like?
Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is it's bad.
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?
Oh, that's because it's Christmas day, Dopinder,
and I'm after someone on my naughty list.
I've been waiting, 1 year, 3 weeks, 6 days and---
14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.
- And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?
- This shit.
Boo!
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.
You're not the only
one with a war to win.
That won't do.
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.
We'd appreciate your patience.
Okay...
We'll deliver in full
the following month.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Fucking mutant!
Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!
That's $27.50.
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.
Merry Christmas!
And a convivial Tuesday
and April to you, Pool!
Oh! Oh, hello!
I know, right? Whose balls did I
have to fondle to get my very own movie?
I can't tell you, but it does rhyme
with "Pulverine". And lemme tell you...
He's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under!
Anyway. I got places to be.
A face to fix. And, oh!
Bad guys to kill.
Maximum effort.
Cock shot!
Rich! Corinthian leather!
I'm looking for Francis!
Have you seen this man?
Yanking, yanking!
I've never said this, but don't swallow.
Shit. Did I leave the stove on?
Now, breaking news.
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
Residents are advised to remain in their homes.
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...
Red suit. Deadpool.
Negasonic! Come. We have mission.
Colossus, wait up.
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?
Which benefits, the matching unitards?
The house that blows up every few years?
Please. House blowing up builds character.
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.
Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.
Deadpool may try to break yours.
Hey!
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!
Let's count 'em down!
Shit, motherfucker!
Ten! Shit.
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!
Bad Deadpool.
Seven. Good Deadpool!
Someone's not counting.
Six!
Four...
Gotcha!
Right up main street!
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.
I'm touching myself tonight.
Francis! Francis!
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?
You're not Francis!
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend said this was a
superhero movie but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kebab!"
Well, I may be super. But I'm no hero.
Anyhow, technically, this is a murder. But some
of the best love stories start with a murder.
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?
- Are you Mr. Merchant?
- The Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!
- Who placed the call?
- I did!
Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty!
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.
That is a no go on the tip-aroo, Jer.
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.
- I dodged a big-time bullet on that one!
- Not, out of the woods yet.
You need to seriously ease up on the
bedazzling. They're jeans, not a chandelier.
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.
- Just look, man, can I have my---
- I will shoot your fucking cat.
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?
Anywho...
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.
And little Megan, she's not made of
money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.
- I'm.....
- A stalker.
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?
Totally done. You should've seen your face!
- I didn't know what to do, I was so scared...
- Soft spot, remember?
Even look in her general direction again and you will learn
in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots, too.
That came out wrong.
Or did it?
Megan.
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.
No friggin' way.
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.
Hey, wait.
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.
Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies
except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.
You'd best hope we never
see your name on a gold card.
(Buck! Liefeld.)
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...
- Hey, I ain't taking any babysitting money,
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?
- You sure?
- Hmm.
For a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded.
Bet you let the kid off easy, too.
He's not a bad kid. Just a little light stalking. I was way
worse when I was his age, travelling to exotic places...
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,
meeting new and exciting people. And then..
Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your instagram.
So what were special forces doing in Jacksonville?
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.
I give you, a blowjob. I'm---
- Why do you make me make that?
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.
- Remind me what good will come of this?
- I don't take the shits, I just disturb them.
What you want?
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.
That's a new stool.
Stay the fuck down.
Alright, move, move, move, move.
Buck, go rest.
He's still breathing.
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.
You bet on me to die. Wow. Motherfucker,
you're the world's worst friend.
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.
And then die. At the city of Detroit.
Sorry. I wanted to win money.
I never win anything.
- Whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drink's on me!
- Yeah!
Domestic! Nothing imported.
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?
Tight.
- Vanessa.
- Wade.
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?
I'd hit that.
Buck, you'd best apologize
before--- yeah. That.
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.
- Breathe through the nose.
- I don't have a filter between my brain and my...
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!
- Get outta here. Go cast a spell.
- Hey, hands off the merchandise.
Merchandise, huh. So you...
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.
- Rough childhood?
- Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.
Daddy left before I was conceived.
- Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
- Where else do you put one out?
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.
- Uncles. They took turns.
- I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole
of a locked closet which also happens to be my...
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.
You had a dishwasher. I didn't even know sleep. It was
pretty much 24/7 ball kegs, brownie mix and clown porn.
Who would do such a thing?
Hopefully, you. Later tonight?
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.
And a low-fat dessert.
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?
It's time to put
balls in holes.
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.
- You love ski ball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
- That's a tough call.
I just wanna get to know the real you. Not the short-
shorted 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.
Balls in holes.
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.
Okay. Here you go.
I had this sucker for a while.
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.
You are now the proud protector of the planet Arus.
And you, can erase stuff. Written in pencil.
- Milady.
- I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.
How many more minutes
could I get for this?
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.
- 5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.
- Deal. What do we do with the remaining 2:37?
Cuddle?
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?
Happy Valentines' Day.
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.
Happy Lenten.
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!
Happy Thanksgiving.
I love you.
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...
Can I visit you
between the holidays?
That sweater is terrible!
But red looks good on you.
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?
Your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?
- You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.
- Right.
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.
Will you...
- Stick it up my---
- ...Marry me?
Uh... Jinx?
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.
- They said 1-month salary, so ...
- You mean...
- I do.
- That's my line.
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!
I feel just like a little girl!
- What if I just held on and never let go?
- Just ride the bitch's back like Yoda on Luke.
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!
Perfect.
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.
Here's the thing:
Life is an endless series of train wrecks with
only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness.
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.
There are certainly options we can look into.
New drugs are being developed every day.
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer and
there were all these experimental drugs from Germany...
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.
Me? I'm memorizing the details of her
face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?
Take your time to process this. It's
important not to do anything rash.
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?
"A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W.
Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."
"His form looks good."
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.
Ringing any bells? No?
How 'bout now?
Wade fucking Wilson.
- Well, hello, gorgeous.
- Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar Pei.
And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time
to undo what you did to this butter face.
You should thank me. Apparently, I've made
you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.
Dad?
I think we can all agree that shit just went
sideways in the most colossal way.
Well, maybe not the most.
Now this, is my most prized possession.
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.
Sounds like you have. Bernadette is not going
anywhere, because you're not going anywhere.
- Drink.
- You're right.
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.
You belong here at home. Surrounded by
your Voltron, and your Bernadette and your me.
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.
Not a good one, like Slapchop,
more Shakeweighty.
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.
We will make you better than better.
- A superhero.
- Look, Agent Smith, I tried the
hero business and it left a mark.
But if I ever hit fuck
-it, I'll look you up.
Oh. Shit.
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...
His drink's on him.
What'd he say?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.
They made 3 of those movies.
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.
But what it does to
the people you love.
Who knew if this guy could save my life? But I
knew there's only one way that I could save hers.
Isn't that what superheroes do?
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.
Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass, local dry
cleaning discounts, lucrative film deals,
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.
Con: they're all lame-ass teacher's pets!
- You know I can hear you.
- Wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them.
Stay right here. You've been
warned before, Deadpool.
This is a shameful and reckless use of your
powers. You will both be coming with us.
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the goody
two-shoes bullshit right now. And you are?
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
Negasonic Teenage---
What the shit?!
That's the coolest name ever!
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.
- Let me guess, X-Men left you behind
on what, shit detail?
- What does that make you?
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"
"I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen
silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences."
So what's it gonna be? Long, sullen
silence? Or mean comment? Go on.
- You got me in a box here.
- We can't allow this, Deadpool. Please, come quietly.
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.
That guy was already
up there when I got here.
- Wade, you are better than this. Join us,
use your powers for good.
- Heads up!
- Be a superhero.
- Listen! The day I decide to be a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,
who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland
Mansion of some creepy, old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker,
on that day, I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend
request. But until then, I'mma do what I came here to do.
- Either that, or slap the bitch out of you!
- Wade...
- Hey. Hey, Douchepool!
- Zip it, Sinead!
And I hope you're watching...
Quite unfortunate.
That does it!
Canada!
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.
Oh, your poor wife!
You really should stop.
All the dinosaurs fear the T-Rex.
- I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
- This is embarassing.
Please. Stay down.
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?
- Do you have 'off' switch?
- Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the 'on' switch?
Enough!
Let us go talk to the Professor.
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!
Oh my God. Nasty.
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
Rock, meet bottom.
When life ends up breathtakingly fucked, you can
generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.
This, well, this was mine.
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.
You've finally hit fuck-it.
- Just promise you'll do right by me.
So I can do right by someone else.
- Of course.
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.
And Jesus! A warmer table.
You should really come up with a safe
word, fellas. I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.
Easy!
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?
I'm calling Wang.
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?
- Patience, Angel. All in good time.
- Are you here for the turn down service or what?
- We have another talker.
- I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.
Shut the fuck up.
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."
But I'm going blunt. This workshop
is not a government-led program.
It's a private institution that turns reclamation
projects like yourself into men of....
Extraordinary abilities.
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly... Wrong.
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates
any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, I hope.
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, also scorched
my nerve endings so I no longer feel pain.
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.
Thank-- thank you! You
have something in your teeth.
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.
It's been bothering
me for a long time.
Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name,
because it sounds suspiciously made up.
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Faulty?
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is your sense of humor.
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.
- He's all yours.
- C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?
This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum, so we're gonna have to make you suffer.
If you're lucky, your mutant genes will
activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion.
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.
Until you finally mutate...
... or die.
- You mean like a bucket list?
- Like a fuck it list, I'd like to light a
spiff off the Olympic torch.
Acid to me, right after.
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...
Vanessa...
I wanna see Vanessa.
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.
- We're just joking.
- No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions.
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.
F-R-A-N-C-I--- oops!
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.
Why don't you do us all a favor and shut
the fuck up? Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
See, here's the problem with round-the-clock
torture, it's that you can't really step it up from there.
Is that what you think?
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.
What we're gonna do is lower the oxygen concentration in
the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
If your brain wave's slowing and you're about
to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2.
If your heart rate slows meaning you're able
to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down.
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?
You still think we're
making you a superhero.
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.
And that's what they'll have you doing. Terrorizing
citizens, putting down freedom fighters.
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.
Wait, wait, wait...
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.
- What have you done to me?
- I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
Striking your cancer as fast as it can form.
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.
But where's the fun in that?
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.
Not because I need to.
Because I want to.
Farewell. Go ahead.
You already smell like shit.
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...
I think we have earned that one.
You take off. Go on, off you go.
Quick question:
What's my name?
Didn't think so.
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!
What's my name?
Wade...
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.
- She doesn't care what you--- Oh!
- Do you like what you see?
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.
Not gently. He was hate-fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship and that was their only catharsis without violence.
And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the British
shitstick who ran the mutant factory. And he's gone--- Poof!
You gotta do something to remedy this. 'Cause
as of now, you only have one course of action:
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror fims.
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.
Here's what I'm actually gonna do:
I'm gonna work thru his crew until somebody gives up Francis,
force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,
- the douchebag does think you're dead, right?
- Yeah.
- That's good. You should keep it that way.
- What, like, wear a mask?
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.
- That'll do.
- What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...
- ... or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie. Oh, shit.
- What?
- I put all my money on you, and now I
just realized I'm never gonna win the....
- Deadpool...
Captain Deadpool.
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.
To you, Mr. Pool. Deadpool. That
sounds like a fuckin' franchise.
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it!
Where's Francis?
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!
Don't make me ask twice.
Where is Francis?
He made me ask twice.
Is the mask muffling my voice?
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!
- No, please...
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
Little spider-monkey!
This is confusing! Is it sexist to hit you, is it
more sexist to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!
Donde esta Francesca?
Tell me where your fucking boss is!
Or you're gonna die! In 5 minutes!
Nice to see you, Jared. I'll
take a foot long. Fully loaded.
- 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89, about to be 90.
- Mr. Wilson?
- You're looking very alive.
- Hah! Only on the outside.
- This is not going to end---
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.
- Where's your boss?
- I can tell you exactly where---
You'll tell me. But first, you might wanna look
away for this. Now this little piggy went to...
Thank you, Agent Smith.
Taxi!
Hop in! Great day for a ride.
And we all know
how this turned out.
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.
There. All caught up.
Sorry! About bleeding
at all your garbage.
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.
Like the kind where your year-long plan
ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.
Morning, sleepyhead.
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.
- Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.
- You mean my big, rubber, masturbating shoes?
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?
Bactine should do it.
How's that () coming along? Ikea
doesn't assemble itself, you know.
You're telling me. I don't mind the ().
It's an improvement on the ().
Anything's an improvement over the ().
I'd taken an () or a () over the ().
No, I didn't get
excited 'till I saw ().
- Screw, please.
- Here? Now? Just kidding. I know it's been decades.
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.
Ta------da...
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.
And I quote, "Looking for roommate, blind, and likes imperfections. Must be good with hands." Or would you rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?
- Why such a douche this morning?
- Let's recap:
The cock-fizzle that turned me into this
freak slipped through my arms today.
Arm.
Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super
-sexy ex back and prevent this from happening to someone else.
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.
#drive-by.
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.
I only wish I'd heal the same.
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.
- Right. And when he heals?
- He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.
- Tylenol PM?
- It sticks back where you stuck the Bactine.
I raided my stash of wisdom just to take a sec
and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.
But I appreciate the gesture.
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?
About the size of a KFC spork.
I get why you're so pissy, but your mood's never gonna
brighten 'till you find this woman and tell her how you feel.
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. McGoo? She wouldn't
have me. If you could see me, you'd understand.
- Looks aren't everything.
- Looks are everything! Ever heard David Beckham speak?
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium. You think
Ryan Reynolds got this far on a superior acting method?
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...
You're blind.
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this arm plows through puberty
and then I'll come up with a whole, new Christmas day plan.
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.
Go, go, go, go, go...
So the doctor says, the bad news is you don't have
that long to live. So the patient says, how long do I have?
The doctor says, five.
The guys says, five what?
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...
Can I help you ladies?
Oh, I do hope so.
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.
Name of Wade Wilson.
Sorry, I don't know the name.
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.
- I've seen this girl.
- This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around. This
isn't really the place to do something like that.
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?
There's a midnight showing of Blade II.
Thanks for having my back, guys.
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, and by we, I mean you.
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?
"Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!
- Or as I like to call her, Irony.
- I gotta find her fast, before numb nuts does.
- How do you know she's in here?
- Some customer stalking that fox.
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.
Especially from this angle.
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.
You weak motherfucker!
C'mon. Get it together, this isn't
about you, this is about Vanessa.
Here we go.
Maximum effort.
Vanessa!
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about... an old boyfriend?
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.
Like a jigsaw puzzle.
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
- Hey, where did she go?
- I saw her head to the back. Go get her, tiger.
Motherfucker!
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate---
- Jiminy---- Fuck! Fuck!
- We can talk... or you can hit that...
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking-- find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd with the smiling face and
the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the () but this is holding my interest.
- I told you, we're going with the (), not the (),
get it thru your head or get outta Fucktown!
- Shit.
- That's all the pieces in the house.
- No, no, no, come on. Let's go. Cough it up.
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.
25 cal. I like it.
Wade...
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.
Oh, listen, Al...
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere
in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness.
Good luck.
You wanna get fucked up?
Put her down over here.
Go on, then.
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.
I've been trying to tell you assholes you
got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.
- Fake laugh! Hiding real pain! Go get Silver balls.
- You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you. It s almost
like, the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.
My chrome-penised friend back there, has agreed to do me this
solid. In exchange, I said I would consider joining his boy band.
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.
- So, any luck winning Gita back?
- I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool, but Bandu
is more craftier and handsomer than me.
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.
He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, DP, I plan to gut
him like a tandoori fish then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)
He's super dead.
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.
Not often a dude ruins your face, skullstomps your sanity, grabs your baby mama and personally sees thru 4 of your 5 shittiest moments.
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.
Hey, where's your duffel bag?
Goddammit! We'll do this the old-
fashioned way. With two swords..
... and maximum effort.
Cue the music.
Wade Wilson!
- What's my name?
- Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for 'ya.
- Go get some.
- Superhero landing. She's gonna
do a superhero landing, wait for it!
Superhero landing! You know, that's really hard
on your knees. Totally impractical, they all do it.
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please----
I mean, that's why I brought her?
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.
Go get her, tiger.
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.
Alright then. Fire!
Finish fucking her the fuck off!
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!
Look away, child. Look away!
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.
So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle, possibly...
... even lover-like treatment.
Fine! Commando!
Teabag!
- Bob?
- Wade?
- Oh my God, I haven't seen you since, TGIFridays!
- Jacksonville. Fridays.
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is she still
fixing that tuna casserole? It's so good, but bad for...
- Your... on the left... You are beautiful...
- That is so sweet! Thanks!
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.
Fire!
Hey! Climb on.
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.
- You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.
- Wade?
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.
- What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.
- Oh, you never left.
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.
Well I hope they've blocked pain to your
every last nerve. 'Cause I'mma go looking!
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.
When I'm finished, what's left to grow back you?
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.
- Fine. Fists.
- Sounds like your last Saturday night.
Asshole!
- Hang in there, baby. I got you.
- Wade!
I got a plan. You're
not gonna like it.
Shit, shit, shit!
Don't worry! I'm
totally on top of this.
Dammit! Maximum effort!
Thanks.
Just take it slow.
Oh, my God! That was so awe---
- Me and you, are headed
to fix this butter face!
- What?
You sure are a fucking idiot.
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?
- What?
- You heard me.
No, no!
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?
Any last words?
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!
Wade!
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?
- Four or five moments, that's all it takes.
- To...?
Be a hero.
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero.
Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true.
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.
Moments when you're offered a choice.
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...
... spare an enemy.
In these moments, everything else falls away.
The way the world sees us.
The way we---
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.
I can't even tell you... I deserve that...
that too.. No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.
Start talking!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,
- I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner...
It's been a rough couple of years.
- Rough?
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...
Every night we spoon for warmth, everybody
fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.
So you live in a house?
I should've come
and found you sooner.
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.
You made this mask?
And this one. In case
the other fell off.
Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Hey...
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..
It's a face...
I'd be happy to sit on.
But I'm not the same underneath
this suit either. Super-penis.
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.
What are you still doing ---- Get
outta here, go make yourself useful.
You, go be a really big brother to someone.
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.
And you, chicken noodle. Nothing
Compares 2 U. Sinead O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.
- That's all right. You're cool.
- What in the ass?
- That was not mean! I'm proud of you!
- We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.
You know, for a second there, it felt like we were 3 mini
lion robots coming together to form one super robot.
- This was stupid.
- Yeah.
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.
Come here.
WHAM! As promised.
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, here we go...
Looks nice, not gonna be the only thing that's pulling out tonight.
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh? Until next
time, this is your friendly neighborhood Pool guy singing...
You're still here.
It's over! Go home!
Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.
What were you expecting, Sam Jackson'll
show up? Eye patch? Saucy leather? Go, go.
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.
In the sequel, we're gonna have Cable. Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time-travel. We have no idea who to cast yet,
but it could be anybody. Just
take a big guy with a flat top.
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley.
She's got range, who knows? Anyway, big secret.
And don't leave your garbage rotting
around. It's a total dick move. Go.

There's a girl in this harbor town.
And she works layin' whiskey down.

And she serves them whiskey and wine.
The sailors say
"Brandy, you're a fine girl".
"What a good wife you would be"

And soon, it'll be everywhere.

I thought your thing was a sword?
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?
It hurts.
It hurts?
I have sensitive nipples.
(ROCKET LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"
What about him? What's he doing?
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.
How is that a priority?
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.
That's hardly important right now.
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.
No, seriously, I side with Drax.
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.
I can clearly see you winking.
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

He said the skin is too thick

Skin is the same level of thickness

I realize that.

(CONTINUES LAUGHING)
What?
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)
What are they called again?
Anulax batteries.
Harbulary batteries.
That's nothing like what I just said.
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.
The cost of transgression is death.
AYESHA: We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.
Impeccable,
both physically and mentally.
We control the DNA of our progeny...
germinating them in birthing pods.
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.
Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.
For academic purposes.
I would be honored, yes.
In the name of research...
I think that could be pretty, uh...
repulsive.
I'm not into that kind of casual...
Oh, please.
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.
Bring it...
and we shall gladly be on our way.
(GRUNTS)
Family reunion. Yay.
I understand she is your sister.
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.
Do with her as you please.
(NEBULA GRUNTS)
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?
My mother is from Earth.
And your father?
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.
I see it within you.
An unorthodox genealogy.
A hybrid that seems particularly...
reckless.
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...
- but that isn't true at all.
- (CROWD GASPS)
ROCKET: Oh, shit.
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?
I'm sorry. That was meant to be

Count yourself blessed
they didn't kill you.
You're telling me.
- You wanna buy some batteries?

(SIGHS)
That stuff about my father...
Who does she think she is?
I know you're sensitive about that.
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.
I wasn't.
I don't care if you were.
Well, I feel like you do care.
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
Damn shadow.
There are two types of beings
in the universe...
those who dance, and those who do not.
Mmm-hmm.
I first met my beloved at a war rally.
Oh, God.
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.
Except one woman.
My Ovette.
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.
She wouldn't even tap her foot.
Wouldn't move a muscle.
One might assume she was dead.
That does sound pretty hot.
It would make
my nether regions engorge.
Okay. I get it, yes.
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.
Mmm.
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.
No. It's not ripe yet...
and I hate you.
You hate me?
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.
And yet here you stand, a hero.
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.
I swear.
No.
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days
in a prison on Xandar...
wishing you could.
- (GRUNTS)
- (ALARM BLARING)
QUILL: This is weird.
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.
GAMORA: Why would they do that?
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.
Dude!
Right.
He didn't steal some of those.
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.
- (QUILL GRUNTS)
- (GAMORA YELPS)
(WHIMPERS)
(GRUNTS)
What were you thinking?
Dude, they were really easy to steal!
- That's your defense?
- Come on!
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!
I was being sarcastic!
Oh, no!
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!
Now I look foolish!
Can we put the bickering on hold...
until after we survive
this massive space battle?
QUILL: More incoming!
ROCKET: Good!
I wanna kill some guys!
(ROCKET YELLING)
(CONTINUES YELLING)
GAMORA: You're not killing anyone.
All those ships are remotely piloted.
(GRUNTS)
Damn it!
(EXCITED CHATTER)
What is the delay, Admiral?
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...
and could destroy the entire fleet.
Our concern is their slight
against our people.
We hired them and they steal from us.
It is heresy of the highest order.
All command modules...
fire with the intent to kill.
(GRUNTS)
What's the nearest habitable planet?
It's called Berhert.
- How many jumps?
- Only one.
But the access point is 47 clicks away.
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.
Quill, to make it through that...
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.
Lucky for us, I...
I am.
ROCKET: What are you doing?
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!
Stop it.
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...
and there's gonna be something squishy
in your pillow case.
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.
Oh, it won't be my turd.
It will be Drax's.
(DRAX LAUGHING)
I have famously huge turds.
We're about to die,

Who?

- What is that?
- Who cares?
That's the jump point! Go!
It's a guy.

GAMORA: Look at this!
Where is the other half of our ship?
QUILL: My ship.
GAMORA: Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field...
had you flown with
what's between your ears
instead of what's between your legs!
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.
More like because he stole...
the Anulax batteries!
They're called Harbulary batteries.
No, they're not!
Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."
I did it because I wanted to!
Dick.
What are we even talking about this for?
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!
How little?
Well, I don't know, like this?
A little one-inch man saved us?
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.
Don't call me a raccoon!
I'm sorry. I took it too far.
I meant trash panda.
Is that better?
I don't know.
It's worse. It's so much worse.
You son of a...
Hey!
ROCKET: I've had it with you!
QUILL: No! Back up!
NEBULA: Someone followed you
through the jump point.
Set me free, you'll need my help.
I'm not a fool, Nebula.
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
No, I won't.
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.
I bet it's the one-inch man.
After all these years, I've found you.
And who the hell are you?
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.
My name is Ego...
and I'm your dad, Peter.

with this woman I end up marrying.
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...
"but you're losing your mind!"
Then again, she's always been that way.
I could never trust her. You know?
Stakar.
It's been some time.
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.
- Sir!
- Stakar!
STAKAR: There's a hundred
Ravager factions.
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.
Please, sir. Please!
Get away from me.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
(GROWLS)
You can go to hell then!
I don't give a damn what you think of me!
So what are you following us for?
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!
Ravagers don't deal in kids.
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!
You didn't know because
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.
I demand a seat at the table!
I wear these flames, same as you.
You may dress like us...
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.
And the Colors of Ogord...
will never flash over your grave.
If you think...
I take pleasure in exiling you...
you're wrong.
You broke all our hearts.
Ah, pathetic.
First, Quill betrays us...
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.
We followed him
because he was the one...
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.
Seems he's goin' soft.
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?
You know I'm right, Kraglin.
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.
RAVAGER: Who the hell is that?
(GRUNTING)
(SIGHS)
Yondu Udonta...
I have a proposition for you.
EGO: I hired Yondu to pick you up...
when your mother passed away.
But instead of returning you...
Yondu kept you.
I have no clue as to why.
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because I was a skinny little kid
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.
It made it easier for thievin'.
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.
DRAX: I thought Yondu was your father.
What? We've been together
this whole time...
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?
You look exactly alike.
One's blue!
No, he's not my father!
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.
- Eat you?
- Yeah.
Oh, that son of a bitch.
How'd you locate us now?
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.
What say we head out there right now?
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.
I promise you...
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.
And there...
I can explain your very special heritage.
Finally get to be...
the father I've always wanted to be.
Excuse me.
I've gotta take a whiz.
I'm not buying it.
Let's go take a walk.

I am Mantis.
What are you doing?
Smiling.
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.
Not if you do it like that.
Oh...

I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.
Yes.

QUILL: Give me a break!
After all this time,
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...
- you wanna be my dad?
- GAMORA: I hear you.
QUILL: And by the way,
this could be a trap.
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...
But what?
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?
Who?
He owned a magic boat?
David Hasselhoff?
Right.
Not a magic boat. A talking car.
Why did he talk again?
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...
and you would tell
all the other children...
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?
I love that story.
- I hate that story.
- (SIGHS)
It's so sad!
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!
That's my point, Peter.
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?
If he ends up being evil...
we will just kill him.
You're leaving me with that fox?
GAMORA: He's not a fox.
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.
(GRUMBLES)
- Or if you feel like it.
- ROCKET: Okay.
It'll be just a couple of days.
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
DRAX: What if the Sovereign come?
QUILL: There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.
I'm uncertain about parting ways.
God, you're like an old woman.
Because I'm wise?
GAMORA: Why do you have
so much luggage?
DRAX: I don't want Groot
playing with my things.
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?
Because it's working.

You will never love me again.

You would never break the chain.

You would never break the chain.
And if you don't love me now.
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying.

(DRAX AND QUILL LAUGHING)
QUILL: Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?
Oh...
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.
Your antennae, what are they for?
Their purpose?
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!
I say...
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.
QUILL: Right.
And if it's anything other than...
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.
They are not for feeling doorways.
- (SIGHS)
- (QUILL LAUGHS)
I think...
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.
What are those?
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.
- You read minds?
- No.
Telepaths know thoughts.
Empaths feel feelings.
Emotions.
May I?
All right.
You feel love.
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.
No!
Romantic, sexual love.
No, I don't.
- For her!
- No!
(LAUGHING)
QUILL: Okay.
(QUILL GROANS)
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!
You must be so embarrassed!
(DRAX CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Do me! Do me!
I have never felt such humor!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
So unbelievably uncool.
- Oh, Quill.
- (CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.
I can also alter emotions to some extent.
QUILL: Yeah, like what?
If I touch someone who is sad...
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.
I can make a stubborn person compliant.
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.
Do one of those on me.
Sleep.

There's too many of them.
He needs my help.
If you care about him...
you need to get me out of these bonds.
They are going to kill him!

it was pretty easy to find you.
I put a tracer on your ship back there...
during the war over Xandar.
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
(CHUCKLES) Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
Otherwise, you'd what?
We'll take them batteries.
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?
That Priestess offered us a million.
A quarter is only one third of that!
A quarter ain't a third.
A quarter is 25.
No.
GEF: We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.
YONDU: Enough!
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

I grew smarter and stronger.

If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?
He would smush her!
(QUILL GROANS)
I don't need to hear how my parents...
Why?
My father would tell the story
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.
That's disgusting.
It was beautiful.
You Earthers have hang-ups.
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.
Ha! Thank you!
It's not half bad.
- Oh.
- Ugh.
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...
and all the accompanying junk.
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...
as I set out amongst the stars...
until I found...
what I sought.
Life.
I was not alone in the universe after all.
When did you meet my mother?
Not long after.
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.
I called her my river lily.
And from that love, Peter...
you.
I have searched for you for so long.
And when I heard of a man from Earth...
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

Captain!
Help me! Please!
Captain!
You're the one what killed those men...
by leading them down the wrong path.
Because you're weak.
- (GRUNTS)
- (ALL CHEERING)
And stupid!
It's time for the Ravagers...
to rise once again to glory
with a new captain...
Taserface!
(ALL CHEERING)
(ROCKET LAUGHING)
I'm sorry. Your name is...
It's Taserface?
That's right.
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?
It's metaphorical!
ALL: Yeah!
For what?
For it is a name what strikes fear...
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.
(ALL MURMURING)
Okay.
ROCKET: Okay...
whatever you say.
You shut up.
You're next.
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...
- (ROCKET SNICKERING)
- What?
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?
"Taserface!" (LAUGHING)
- That's how I hear you in my head!
- (ALL SNICKERING)
What was your second choice?
- Scrotum Hat?
- (ALL LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING)
New plan. We're killing you first.
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.
That's enough killing for today.
(RAVAGERS MURMURING)
RAVAGER: She's the daughter
of Thanos.
TASERFACE: I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.
I assure you...
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...
or a talking woodland beast.
I want 10% of the take...
and a couple more things.
KRAGLIN: We got
a whole box of hands...
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.
What are you gonna do with your share?
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me
battle one another in training.
Every time my sister prevailed...
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.
But she won...
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.
So after I murder my sister...
I will buy a warship
with every conceivable
instrument of death.
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...
piece by piece...
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...
I know every single day.
Yeah.
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.
Or a nice hat.
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"
Anyways, happy trails.
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.
Peter...
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.
But you left...
the most wonderful woman ever...
to die alone.
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...
and the light within it...
this form will wither and perish.
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?
I loved your mother, Peter!
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!
I know exactly what that feels like!
I had to watch her die!
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...
I've made many mistakes, Peter.
But you're not one of them.
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...
and the light within.
They are a part of you, Peter.
What do you mean?
Give me your hands, son.
Here.
Hold them like that.
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.
(QUILL EXHALES DEEPLY)
(GASPS)
Yes!
Whoa!
Yes! It's okay.
Just relax. Concentrate.
You can do it. Bring it back.
Yes!
Yes, now shape it.
Feel that energy.
Yes.
You're home.
Peter...
DRAX: How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?
MANTIS: Ego found me
in my larva state.
Orphaned on my homeworld.
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.
So you're a pet?
I suppose.
People usually want cute pets.
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?
I am hideous?
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.
But that's a good thing.
Oh?
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...
you know they love you for who you are.
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.
DRAX: Those pools,
they remind me of a time...
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.
She was like you.
Disgusting?
Innocent.
(SOBS)
(SIGHS)
Drax?
There's something I must tell you.
What's going on?
This gross bug lady is my new friend.
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.
You're not ugly. Drax!
What are you talking about?
GAMORA: Mantis...
can you show us where we'll be staying?
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?
MANTIS: The planet is Ego.
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.
And you're not a flea?
I'm a flea with a purpose.
I help him sleep.
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?
Nothing.
Your quarters are this way.
(BOTH GRUNT)
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.
Okay, Taserface.
Hey, tell the other guys we said...
"Hi," Taserface!
(SIGHS)
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?
No, Gef.
It's too adorable to kill.
Take it to the tailor.
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.
But I was young...
and greedy, and stupid.
Like you stealing those batteries.
That was mostly Drax.
Me and Stakar and the other captains...
we weren't so different from
you and your friends.
The only family I ever had.
When I broke the code...
they exiled me.
This is what I deserve.
Slow down, drama queen.
You might deserve this, but I don't.
We gotta get outta here.
Where's Quill?
He went off with his old man.
- Ego?
- Yeah.
It's a day for dumbass names.
(CHUCKLES)
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.
You like a professional asshole or what?
Pretty much a pro.
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?
He was skinny.
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.
Uh-huh.
I got an idea on how to get outta here.
But we're gonna need your little friend.
ALL: (CHANTING)

YONDU: Psst!
Hey, twig!
Come here.
Come on.
Aw, man...
what did they do to you?
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...
the thing I wore on my head.
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.
You got it?
(RAVAGERS SNORING)
That's my underwears.
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.
You have to explain it more careful.
It's a prototype fin.
(SCREECHING)
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.
You explain it this time.
All right.
YONDU: That's Vorker's eye.
He takes it out when he sleeps.
Go. Look again.
But leave the eye here.
Why?
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...
and he's not gonna know...
where his eye is! (LAUGHING)
That's a desk.
We told you it was this big.
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...
with a bunch of severed human toes.
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.
Okay?
What? No!
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.
That's not what I said!
I am Groot.
He's relieved you don't want him to.
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.
I am Groot.
On anyone, not just himself.
I am Groot.
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.
That's why you don't like hats?
This is an important conversation
right now?
(SNORING)
(BURPS)
KRAGLIN: That ain't it.
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.
They killed all my friends.

Drax thinks you're not a dancer.
If you ever tell anyone about this...
I will kill you.
When are we gonna do something
about this unspoken thing between us?
What unspoken thing?
This...
Cheers, Sam and Diane...
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...
but never say it because if they do,
the ratings would go down...
sort of thing.
There's no unspoken thing.
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,
then it would be spoken...
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.
No, that's not what I...
(SIGHS)
What we should be discussing right now
is something about this place.
It doesn't feel right.
What are you talking about?
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!
That girl Mantis...
she's afraid of something.
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?
I'm not trying...
He's my father. He's blood.
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.
Again, you made me come here!
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?
That's the half I'm worried about.
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.
You were insufferable to begin with.
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...
to open themselves up
to new possibility,
and the other person is a jerk...
who doesn't trust anybody!
It's a show that doesn't exist.
That's why it would get zero ratings!

It's fortuitous...
you listening to this song.
- You know...
- Brandy?
By Looking Glass?
(CHUCKLES) A favorite of your mom's.
Yeah, it was.
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.
Perhaps its very greatest.
Yes!
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.
He came on a summer's day.
Bringing gifts from far away.
Like the child I put in your mother...
or the freedom you brought Gamora.
Brandy, you're a fine girl.
What a good wife you would be.
My life, my love.
My lady is the sea.
The sea calls the sailor back.
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...
No, Peter...
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...
as long as the light
burns within the planet.
I'm immortal?
Mmm-hmm.
Really?
Yes! As long as the light exists.
And I can use the light
to build cool things...
like how you made this whole planet?
It might take you
a few million years of practice...
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!
What!
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...
and Heather Locklear.
You can do anything you want.
I'm gonna make some weird shit.
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.
Only we can remake the universe.
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...
and lead it to where it needs to go.
How?
Come with me.
(GASPS)

No, that's not what I...
(RETCHING)
What are you doing?
I'm imagining being with you physically.
Drax...
I don't like you like that.
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.
Hey! There's no need to get personal.
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.
I should have told you earlier.
I'm stupid. You are in danger.
(BOTH PANTING)
What is that?
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.
Everything around us,

Everything is temporary.
We are forever.
Doesn't eternity get boring?
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...
which is why you're here.
I told you how all those years ago...
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...
it was all so...
disappointing.
And that is when I came...
to a profound realization.
My innate desire to seek out other life...
was not so that I could
walk among that life.
Peter...
I have found meaning.
(GASPING)
I see it.
Eternity!
Oh, my God.

I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!
I can lord this over him forever.

What are you laughing at me for?
You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.
I know who you are.
You don't know anything
about me, loser.
I know everything about you.
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.
Shut up!
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...
because just a little bit of love...
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.
I said shut up!
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.
I'm serious, dude!
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...
their own little baby, into slavery.
I know who you are, boy.
Because you're me.
What kind of a pair are we?
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.

(GAMORA YELLS)
Who are you people?
What is this place?
Gamora, let her go!
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?
You are scared.
(MANTIS COUGHING)
I call it the Expansion.
It is my purpose...
and now it is yours as well.
It's beautiful.
Over thousands of years...
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...
on thousands of worlds.
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...
To grow and spread...
covering all that exists...
until everything is...
Me!
What did she do to me?
She already told me everything.
I only had one problem.
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power
for such an enterprise.
But two Celestials...
Well, now, that just might do.
The bodies...
are his children.
EGO: Out of all my labors...
the most beguiling was...
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...
to power the Expansion.
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.
It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.
But one after the other, they failed me.
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.
Until you, Peter.
Out of all my spawn...
only you carried
the connection to the light.
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.
- Then we just go.
- No!
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.
You're right.
We're family.
We leave no one behind.
Except maybe you.
Oh, my God.
For the first time in my existence...
I am truly not alone!
What is it, son?
My friends.
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.
Yes.
We are beyond such things.
Yes.
- Now...
- But my mother...
You said you loved my mother.
And that I did.
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.
And I knew if I returned a fourth...
I'd never leave.
The Expansion...
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.
So, I did what I had to do.
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.
What?
Now, all right...
I know that sounds bad.
(GROANING)
Who in the hell do you think you are?
You killed my mother!
I tried...
so hard...
to find the form...
that best suited you...
and this is the thanks I get?
You really need to grow up.

but I suppose you'll have to learn
by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!

QUILL: Whoo-hoo!
So, we're saving the galaxy again?
I guess.
Awesome!
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...
if we're two-time galaxy savers.
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...
and all the animals on the planets.
And the people.
Meh.
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

Captain?
(TRANSMISSION BREAKING UP)
Tell me why Ego wants you here?
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...
to help destroy the universe.
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.
So, could you?
A little.
I made a ball.
A ball?
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.
You "thought"?
You think when I make this arrow fly...
- I use my head?
- (GROANS)
(GRUNTING)
(ALL YELP)
Whoa.
There.
That's Ego's core.
GAMORA: That ore is thick, Rocket.
I got it covered.
We must hurry.
It will not take Ego long to find us.
Keep it steady.
We drill into the center, we kill him!
KRAGLIN: Captain?
What is it, Kraglin?
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?
- Yeah, why?

Oh, hell!

Why aren't you firing the lasers?
They blew out the generator.
I think I packed a small detonator.
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.
Well, we got these.
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...
throughout his entire nervous system.
Meaning what?
The entire planet will explode.
We'll have to get out of here fast.
I rigged a timer.
QUILL: Go!
(QUILL GRUNTING)
He's coming.
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?
When he wants. He's too powerful.
I can't!
You don't have to believe in yourself...
because I believe in you.
(GASPING)
(YELLS)
Sleep!
(GASPS)
I never thought she'd be able to do it...
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.
I don't know how long I can hold him.
ROCKET: The metal's too thick.
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.
QUILL: Well...
That's a terrible idea.
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.
(GROANS) Unbelievable.
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."
(SIGHS) What a day.
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.
That activates it.
Then you push this button...
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.
Now, whatever you do...
don't push this button...
because that will set off
the bomb immediately
and we'll all be dead.
Now, repeat back what I just said.
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.
- I am Groot.
- That's right.
- I am Groot.
- No!
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!
Try again.
Hmm...
- I am Groot.
- Mmm-hmm.
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.
I am Groot.
No! That's exactly what you just said!
How is that even possible?
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?
Point to it.
No!
QUILL: Hey, you're
making him nervous!
Shut up and get me some tape!
Does anybody have any tape out there?
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.
I don't have any tape. Let me check.
Yo, Yondu... Ow!
Do you have any tape?
(QUILL GROANING)
Gamora? Do you have any tape?
Tape!
Never mind. Ow!
Drax, do you have any tape?
- (ROCKET COUGHS)
- Yes, Scotch tape would work.
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,
if you don't have any?
Nobody has any tape!
Not a single person has tape?
Nope!
Did you ask Nebula?
Yes!
Are you sure?
I asked Yondu...
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!
You are wasting a lot of time here!
Whee!
We're all gonna die.
YONDU: Rear thrusters are out again!
- We're done for without that generator!

She's just unconscious.
How long until the bomb goes off?
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...
about six minutes.

T-minus five minutes.

You can't.

(SOBBING)
QUILL: I told Gamora...
how when I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.
Earlier, it struck me...
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.
He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...
but he did have the whistle of one.
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...
and hooked up with hot women...
and fought robots.
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.
Only it was you, Yondu.
I had a pretty cool dad.
What I'm trying to say here is...
sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...
it's right there by your side all along.
You don't even know it.
(SNIFFLES)
I am Groot.
He did call you twig.
Nebula...
I was a child like you.
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.
I'm trying to make it right.
There are little girls like you...
across the universe who are in danger.
You can stay with us and help them.
I will help them by killing Thanos.
I don't know if that's possible.
(NEBULA GASPS)
You will always be my sister.
KRAGLIN: Pete!
Captain found this for you
in a junker shop.
Said you'd come back
to the fold someday.
What is it?
It's called a Zune.
It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.
It's got 300 songs on it.
300 songs?
Wait.
Rocket grabbed the pieces,
and reassembled them.
I think Yondu would want you to have it.
Thanks...
Captain.

What is it?

It's a Ravager funeral.
(GASPING)
Yeah!
Yeah!
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.
No, he did not, son.
He did not.
Fare thee well, old friend.
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.
He didn't chase them away.
No.
Even though he yelled at them.
And was always mean.
And he stole batteries he didn't need.
Well, of course not.

("GUARDIANS INFERNO" PLAYING)
Ugh, dude.
Seriously?
You gotta clean up your room.
It's a complete mess.
I am Groot.
I am not boring. You're boring.
You know what's boring?
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!
I'm not boring!
I am Groot.
And now I know how Yondu felt.
HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...
just remember...
We. Are. Groot.
Hey, fellas.
Wait, where are you going?
You were supposed to be my lift home.
How will I get out of here?
Hey! Aw, gee...
I've got so many more stories to tell.
Aw, guys.
Oh, gee...

Now, I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"
Well, sometimes you have to get captured
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.
See, I spent some time on Earth...
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.
Then I went searching through the Cosmos
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.
Didn't find any.
That's when I came across
a path of death and destruction,
which led me all the way here
into this cage,
where I met you.
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?
Thor, son of Odin.
Surtur, son of a bitch.
You're still alive.
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.
I cannot die.
Not until I fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home.
It's funny you should mention that.
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.
And you, Surtur,
are at the center of all of them.
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.
Hang on.
I'll be back around shortly.
I really feel like
we were connecting there.
Okay, so Ragnarok.
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.
My time has come.
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame,
I shall be restored to my full might.
I will tower over the mountains,
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...
Hang on. Give it a second.
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.
I'm really sorry.
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame
and then you'll suddenly grow as big
as a house?
A mountain!
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
locked away on Asgard?
Odin is not on Asgard.
And your absence has left the throne
defenseless.
Okay, so where is it? This crown?
This is my crown,
the source of my power.
Oh, that's a crown.
I thought it was a big eyebrow.
It's a crown.
Anyway, it sounds like
all I have to do to stop Ragnarok
is rip that thing off your head.
But Ragnarok has already begun.
You cannot stop it.
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.
All will suffer, all will burn.
That's intense.
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.
But it looks like I'm gonna have to
choose option B,
where I bust out of these chains,
knock that tiara off your head,
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.
You cannot stop Ragnarok.
Why fight it?
Because that's what heroes do.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.
And, now!
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.
I make grave mistakes all the time.
Everything seems to work out.
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,
but I could really use a fast exit.
Heimdall?
Heimdall was an idiot.
This job should have made him rich.
Now, the job ain't easy
but it does have its benefits.
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.
Behold...
My stuff.
I'm particularly fond of these.
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard
called Texas.
I even named them. Des and Troy.
You see, when you put them together,
they destroy.
Heimdall, come on.
Stay!
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.
Heimdall?
Skurge?
Is that important?
You girls are in for a treat.
Girls!
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.
Thanks for scaring away my company
and drenching my workplace in brains.
Who are you?
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
We fought together on Vanaheim.
Right. Where is Heimdall?
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.
Traitor?
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall
with negligence of duty
but he disappeared before the trial.
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.
Sure.
Hold on.
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.
What the hell is that?
Oh, brother. This is it.
I take my leave.
You fool, you didn't listen!
I'm sorry.
Lady Sif, get help!
Somebody, help!
Sorry for all I've done.
It's all right. Hold on.
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.
They'd be lucky to have you.
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.
I'm a trickster.
So mischievous.
Sorry about that time I turned you
into a frog.
It was a wonderful joke.
'Twas indeed hilarious.
You are the savior of Asgard.
- Tell my story.
- I will.
Build a statue for me.
We will build a big statue for you.
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.
I will tell Father
what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
And so, Loki died of his wounds,
giving his life for ours.
He fought back those disgusting elves,
he brought peace to the realm.
Loki, my boy...
'Twas many moons ago I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.
On that day,
I did not yet see in you
Asgard's savior. No.
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle
that melted this old fool's heart.
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.
Father.
Shit.
My son, Thor, has returned!
Greetings, my boy.
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.
The people wanted to commemorate him.
Indeed they should.
I like the statue.
A lot better looking than he was
when he was alive, though.
A little less weaselly, less greasy,
maybe.
Do you know what this is?
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster
and destroy the whole planet.
Thank you, dear.
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?
Nope.
I've been having this reoccurring dream
lately.
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.
That's just a silly dream,
signs of an overactive imagination.
Possibly.
But then I decide to go out there
and investigate.
And what do I find,
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,
all while you, Odin,
the protector of those Nine Realms,
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.
Yes, it is best
to respect our neighbors' freedom.
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.
Watching theater.
Board meetings,
and security council meetings...
- You're really gonna make me do it?
- Do what?
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir
as it returns to my hand.
Not even your face.
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.
Then I'll see you on the other side,
brother.
All right, I yield.
Behold!
Thor...
- Odinson.
- No.
You had one job. Just the one.
Where's Odin?
You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Everything was fine without you.
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.
- Ask them.
- Where's Father? Did you kill him?
You had what you wanted.
You had the independence you asked for.
Okay. I know exactly where he is.
I swear I left him right here.
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?
Great planning.
How was I supposed to know?
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.
No? Then why do you dress like one?
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.
I saw you die.
I mourned you, I cried for you.
I'm honored.
Ask him.
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture
with us?
Sure.
Start figuring out where he is.
Oh, my God.
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
She didn't dump me, you know.
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.
What's this? What are you doing?
This isn't me.
Loki.
Thor Odinson.
God of Thunder.
You can put down the umbrella.
So, Earth has wizards now?
The preferred term is
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.
All right, wizard. Who are you?
Why should I care?
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.
Take a seat.
Tea?
I don't drink tea.
What do you drink?
Not tea.
So, I keep a watch list of individuals
and beings from other realms
that may be a threat to this world.
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.
He's a worthy inclusion.
Then why bring him here?
We're looking for my father.
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was,
all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?
Promptly.
Great! Then I'll help you.
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.
And you don't have a phone.
No, I don't have a phone,
but you could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.
So if you could tell me where he is,
I can take him home.
Gladly. He's in Norway.
I'm just seeing whether this incantation
requires any Asgardian modifications.
Nope.
We don't need that.
Will you stop doing that?
I need just one strand of your hair.
Let me explain something.
My hair is not to be meddled with.
We could have just walked.
He's waiting for you.
All right.
Don't forget your umbrella.
Yes.
Sorry.
There we go.
I suppose I'll need my brother back.
Yeah. Right.
I have been falling for 30 minutes!
You can handle him from here.
Yes. Of course.
Thank you very much for your help.
Good luck.
Handle me? Who are you?
Loki.
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...
Bye-bye.
Father?
Look at this place. It's beautiful.
Father, it's us.
My sons.
I've been waiting for you.
I know. We've come to take you home.
Home, yes.
Your mother, she calls me.
Do you hear it?
Loki, lift your magic.
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.
Frigga would have been proud.
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.
I know we failed you.
But we can make this right.
I failed you.
It is upon us. Ragnarok.
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.
No.
It has already begun. She's coming.
My life was all that held her back.
But my time has come.
I cannot keep her away any longer.
Father, who are you talking about?
Goddess of Death. Hela.
My firstborn.
Your sister.
Your what?
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.
Locked her away.
She draws her strength from Asgard,
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.
No, we won't.
I'm on a different path now.
This you must face alone.
I love you, my sons.
Look at that.
Remember this place.
Home.
Brother.
This was your doing.
So he's gone.
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.
You must be Hela.
I'm Thor, son of Odin.
Really? You don't look like him.
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.
You sound like him.
Kneel.
Beg your pardon?
Kneel.
Before your queen.
I don't think so.
It's not possible.
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.
Bring us back!
No!
Loki!
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?
I'm Hela.
I'm just a janitor.
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.
How would you like a job?
Are you a fighter?
Or are you food?
I'm just passing through.
It is food.
On your knees.
He's mine.
Wait!
Wait!
He's mine.
So if you want him, you go through me.
But we've already got him.
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.
More food.
Thank you.
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.
I've got something special.
Hey! Where are you taking me?
Answer me!
Hey!
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.
Many apologies, your majesty.
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard,
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.
My father is dead.
As are the princes.
You're welcome.
We were once the seat
of absolute power in the Cosmos.
Our supremacy was unchallenged.
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.
Our destiny is to rule over all others.
And I am here to restore that power.
Kneel before me
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.
Whoever you are,
whatever you've done, surrender now!
Or we will show you no mercy.
Whoever I am?
Did you listen to a word I said?
This is your last warning!
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Fine.
Charge!
I've missed this.
Still, it's a shame.
Good soldiers dying for nothing,
all because
they couldn't see the future.
Sad.
Look, still alive.
Change of heart?
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.
You evil demoness!
Let's go see my palace.
Fear not, for you are found.
You are home,
and there is no going back.
No one leaves this place.
But what is this place?
The answer is Sakaar.
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.
It is the collection point
for all lost and unloved things.
Like you.
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.
You are valuable.
Here you are loved.
What the hell?
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.
He is the original,
the first lost and the first found.
The creator of Sakaar,
and father of the Contest of Champions.
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.
You are the property of the Grandmaster.
Congratulations!
You will meet the Grandmaster
in five seconds.
Prepare yourself.
Prepare yourself.
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.
He's wonderful.
It is a he?
It is a he.
Yeah.
I love when you come to visit, 142.
You bring me the best stuff.
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
about Scrapper 142,
what do I always say? "She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."
Trash.
No, not trash.
Were you waiting just to call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."
Booze hag.
I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."
'Cause I always say you're the best.
She brought me my beloved champion,
you know.
You say that every time she's here.
What have you brought today? Tell me.
A contender.
A what?
I need to go closer.
I want to get a closer look at this.
Can you take us closer? Thank you.
Pay this lady.
Just wait a damn minute.
I'm not for sale.
Man, he's a fighter.
I take 10 million.
Tell her she's dreaming.
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.
You'll pay for this.
No, I got paid for this.
Here's what I wanna know.
Who are you?
I am the God of Thunder.
I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your
fingers, was that sparkles?
We've located your cousin.
Good!
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.
There he is.
Hey, cuz.
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?
Hi.
So...
Please.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Carlo...
I pardon you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're officially pardoned.
From life.
Help me.
Oh, my God!
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!
The smell.
What does it smell like?
Burnt toast.
What happened to my manners?
I haven't properly introduced myself.
Come on. Follow me.
My name is Grandmaster.
I preside over a little harlequinade
called the Contest of Champions.
People come from far and wide
to unwillingly participate in it.
And you, my friend,
might just be part of the new cast.
What do you say to that?
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games.
I'm going back to Asgard.
Ass-gard.
One, two, three, four.
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.
At that moment, I let go.
Loki?
Loki! Loki!
Over here. Over here.
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!
- What?
- You're alive?
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.
- Get me out of this one. Get me out.
- I can't.
- I can't.
- What?
I've made friends with this man.
He's called the Grandmaster.
- He's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.
The Bifrost brought me out here
weeks ago.
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.
I just got here.
What are you whispering about?
Time works real different
around these parts.
On any other world, I'd be, like,
millions of years old.
But here on Sakaar...
In any case, you know this...
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
God of Thunder.
Tell him.
I've never met this man in my life.
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.
Is he any kind of a fighter?
You take this thing out of my neck
and I'll show you.
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.
If you wanna get back to Ass-place,
Assberg...
Asgard.
Any contender who defeats my champion,
their freedom they shall win.
Fine. Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick!
That's what I call, contender.
Direction would be this way, Lord.
Loki!
Hey. Take it easy, man.
Over here.
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.
I'm kind of like the leader in here.
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.
But don't let that intimidate you.
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke
for you.
This is my very good friend over here,
Miek.
He's an insect and has knives for hands.
You're a Kronan, aren't you?
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.
So hardly anyone turned up, except for
my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.
As punishment, I was forced
to be in here and become a gladiator.
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.
Do you reckon you'd be interested?
How did you...
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here, man.
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?
Doug has.
Doug!
Our luck, Doug's dead.
That's right.
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.
What about you? You're made of rocks.
Perishable rock.
There you go. Another one gone.
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.
Wait. You're not gonna face him,
are you?
Yes, I am.
Gonna fight him, win,
and get the hell out of this place.
That's exactly what Doug used to say.
See you later, new Doug.
Does no one remember me?
Has no one been taught our history?
Look at these lies.
Goblets and garden parties?
Peace treaties?
Odin...
Proud to have it,
ashamed of how he got it.
We were unstoppable.
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.
One by one, the realms became ours.
But then,
simply because my ambition outgrew his,
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.
Before that,
Asgard's warriors were honored,
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.
Most of the stuff in here is fake.
Or weak.
Smaller than I thought it would be.
That's not bad.
But this...
The Eternal Flame.
Want to see what true power
really looks like?
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
I've missed you.
I've missed you all.
Odin,
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,
where the brave shall live forever.
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,
for those that have died
the glorious death.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Being lied to.
Being told you're one thing
and then learning it's all a fiction.
You didn't think
I'd really come and see you, did you?
This place is disgusting.
Does this mean you don't want my help?
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position
with the Grandmaster.
It took me time to win his trust.
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.
What I'm telling you is, you could
join me at the Grandmaster's side.
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?
Our sister destroyed your hammer
like a piece of glass.
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.
You don't stand a chance.
Do you understand
what I'm saying here?
Fine.
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.
Like I've always done.
Would you say something?
Say something!
What would you like me to say?
You faked your own death,
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.
Have I said enough or would you like me
to go back further than the past two days?
You know, I haven't seen this
beloved champion he talks of,
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.
I've placed a large wager against you
tomorrow.
Don't let me down.
Piss off, ghost!
He's freaking gone.
Yuck!
There's still someone's hair and blood
all over this.
Guys, can you clean up the weapons
once you finish your fight?
Disgusting slobs.
Thor,
wanna use a big wooden fork?
No.
Yeah, not really useful.
Unless you're fighting off three vampires
that were huddled together.
I really wish I had my hammer.
Hammer?
Quite unique.
It was made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.
And when I spun it really, really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.
You rode a hammer?
No, I didn't ride the hammer.
The hammer rode you on your back?
No. I used to spin it really fast,
and it would pull me off the...
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?
The ground. It would pull me off the
ground, up into the air, and I would fly.
Every time I threw it,
it would always come back to me.
Sounds like you had a pretty special
and intimate relationship with this hammer
and that losing it was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.
That's a nice way of putting it.
I said they're mine.
See her,
that's the one that put me in here.
Yeah. Scrapper 142.
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.
They are hard to perish.
Asgardian?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.
Asgard is in danger.
My God, you're a Valkyrie.
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger,
until I found out that
you were all women.
There's nothing wrong with women,
of course. I love women.
Sometimes a little too much.
Not in a creepy way,
just more of a respectful appreciation.
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.
It's about time.
Are you done?
Lord of Thunder, you're up.
Please, help me. I need your help.
Bye.
Fine, then you must be a traitor
or a coward.
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect
the throne.
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.
Bring him in for processing.
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.
Now, don't you move.
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair,
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.
Please.
Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.
Please! No!
No!
Look at all of you.
What a show! What a night!
Who's having fun?
Please, I'm your host.
Big round of applause
for all of our undercard competitors,
who today died so gruesomely.
Good sports.
What a show! What a night!
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.
And now, without further ado,
it's main event time.
Making his first appearance,
though he looks quite promising,
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.
I'll say no more, see what you think.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Lord of Thunder.
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.
Okay, this is it.
Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.
He is a creature.
What can we say about him?
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.
I feel a special connection with him.
He's undefeated.
He's the reigning.
He's the defending.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you...
Your Incredible...
Hulk!
Yes!
I have to get off this planet.
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
Hey!
We know each other.
He's a friend from work.
Where have you been?
Everybody thought you were dead.
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer.
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?
He's up there.
Loki! Look who it is!
Banner,
I never thought I would say this,
but I'm happy to see you.
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!
Banner.
Hey, Banner!
No Banner. Only Hulk.
What are you doing?
It's me. It's Thor!
Banner, we're friends.
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!
Here we go.
What?
Hey, big guy.
The sun's getting real low.
That's it.
The sun's going down.
I won't hurt you anymore.
No one will.
Yes!
That's how it feels!
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.
All right. Screw it.
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out!
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!
I told them we were friends!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Another day, another Doug.
What is that noise?
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.
There's a resistance trying to knock down
the front gates.
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.
What I meant was,
what's your ambition?
I just want a chance to prove myself.
Recognition.
When I was young,
every great king had an executioner.
Not just to execute people,
but also to execute their vision.
But mainly to execute people.
Still, it was a great honor.
I was Odin's executioner.
And you shall be my executioner.
Let's begin our conquest.
Skurge, where's the sword?
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.
Those people you mentioned,
the ones who aren't falling into line...
Round them up.
Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
These bloody things are everywhere.
Come on.
You'll be safe here.
Are we cool?
It's Hulk in a hot tub.
So how long
have you been like that?
Like what?
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.
Hulk always Hulk.
How'd you get here?
Winning.
You mean cheating?
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?
How'd you arrive here?
Quinjet.
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?
That's naked.
He's very naked.
It's in my brain now.
Quinjet.
Yes!
I'm getting us out of here.
This terrible, awful place.
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.
Hulk stay.
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.
We must prevent Ragnarok.
Ragnarok?
The prophesied death of my home world.
The end of days, it's the end of...
If you help me get back to Asgard,
I can help you get back to Earth.
Earth hate Hulk.
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.
You're one of the Avengers.
One of the team, one of our friends.
This is what friends do.
They support each other.
You're Banner's friend.
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.
Banner's friend.
I don't even like Banner.
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."
Thor go. Hulk stay.
Fine.
Stay here.
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.
Smash you.
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Baby arms.
- What?
Baby.
Moron! You big child.
Thor go!
I am going.
Thor go again.
Thor home.
Hulk trains.
That's great. Have fun.
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.
What have you been up to?
Winning.
Heimdall, I know you can see me.
I need you to help me.
Help me see.
I see you, but you're far away.
What's going on here?
Come see for yourself.
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold
built by our ancestors.
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?
We won't last long if we stay.
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.
Come on.
Hela is ravenous.
If I let her leave, she'll consume
Nine Realms and all the Cosmos.
We need you.
I'm working on it. But I don't even know
where the hell I am.
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.
- Which one?
- The big one.
Thor sad.
Shut up.
Thor sad.
I'm not sad, you idiot.
I'm pissed off!
Angry. I lost my father.
I lost my hammer.
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
- You're not even listening.
Don't kick stuff.
You're being a really bad friend.
You bad friend!
- You know what we call you?
- No.
We call you the stupid Avenger.
You're tiny Avenger!
What, are you crazy?
Yes.
You know what? Earth does hate you.
No.
I'm sorry I said those things.
You're not the stupid Avenger.
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.
It's okay.
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.
Hulk always, always angry.
I know.
We're the same, you and I.
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.
Yeah, same.
Hulk like fire, Thor like water.
We're kind of both like fire.
But Hulk like real fire.
Hulk like raging fire.
Thor like smoldering fire.
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.
Angry girl.
What's going on? What are you...
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone?
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.
I need her to stay.
Stay?
Block.
Stay.
- Please.
- Please.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I'll listen to you
till this is empty.
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.
We need to get back there.
I need your help.
Finished. Bye.
Odin is dead.
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.
I'm going to stop her.
- Alone?
- Nope.
I'm putting together a team.
It's me, you, and the big guy.
No. No team. Only Hulk.
It's me and you.
I think it's only you.
Please, listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.
I'm not getting dragged into
another one of Odin's family squabbles.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace
and tried to seize the throne.
When she tried
to escape her banishment
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.
I only survived because...
Look, I already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne,
and it cost me everything.
That's what's wrong with Asgard.
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.
I agree.
Don't get familiar.
I agree.
That's why I turned down the throne.
But this isn't about the crown.
This is about the people.
They're dying
and they're your people, too.
Forget it.
I have.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Good. Great.
- Great.
Thank you.
- For what?
- For this.
Didn't see that, did you?
There... That's better.
You know, go ahead.
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.
Keep drinking, keep hiding.
But me...
I choose to run toward my problems
and not away from them.
Because that's what...
Because that's what heroes do.
Friend stay!
Yes!
All right.
Come on.
Welcome. Voice activation required.
Thor.
Access denied.
Thor, son of Odin.
Access denied.
God of Thunder.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Damn you, Stark.
Point Break.
Welcome, Point Break.
Friend stay!
No, no, no!
Stop!
Stay!
Hulk, stop breaking everything!
Don't go!
Nice work, big guy.
We don't know where Ultron's headed,
but you're going very high, very fast.
So, I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode,
so I need you to help me out. Okay?
I need you to...
No! No, Banner!
Oh, jeez.
Banner.
Hey, hey, hey.
You all right, Banner?
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.
That's it, breathe.
I won't hurt you.
Sun's going down.
- Thor.
- Yeah.
What happened to your hair?
Some creepy old man cut it off.
- It looks good.
- Thanks.
Where are we? How's Nat?
- Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?
- Banner, listen.
- What?
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.
What are you saying?
What?
I've been Hulk for two years?
I'm afraid so.
What the hell happened?
Banner, there's something
you should know.
Voice activation required.
Banner.
Welcome, strongest Avenger.
What?
Ship's log.
Thor, where are we?
Yeah, about that.
Sakaar, hear ye.
Attention please. I have some bad news.
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.
Who's that?
He kind of runs the place.
You actually lived at his house
for awhile.
- I did?
- Yeah.
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.
Doesn't sound right.
Well, it's true.
It seems that that criminally seductive
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.
Oh, no.
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.
No, no, no.
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.
These are Tony's clothes.
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?
No, he's not here.
But listen. Just stay calm, okay?
The sun's going down. The sun's getting
really low. Sun's going down.
I'm upset!
I'm very upset.
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.
And you know who I'm blaming?
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!
Don't interrupt me!
Here you go.
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?
He was interrupting.
That's not a capital violation.
Where was I?
My precious champion
has come up missing,
and it's all because of that
Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.
Your brother.
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated, or you know.
I'm sure there's a big history.
And your contender...
My dear friend,
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could
bring them both back to you. Alive.
I could do it in two.
I could do it in one.
Let's stop there.
You know what? I woke up this morning
thinking about a public execution.
But for now,
I'll settle for this sweet little
"Who's gonna get him first?"
So, you're on the clock.
What have you done?
I don't answer to you, lackey.
It's Loki.
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.
Why would you help my brother escape
with that green fool?
I don't help anyone.
You're a Valkyrie.
I thought the Valkyrie had all died
gruesome deaths.
Choose your next words wisely.
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low.
Oh, shoot.
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?
I just need you to stay calm.
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.
Yeah. One.
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.
It's a new experience.
My neurons, they're firing faster
than my brain can handle the information.
The whole thing
is totally different this time.
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.
No, it's not what matters.
What I'm trying to tell you, is that
if I turn into the Hulk again,
Banner may never come back.
And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.
Thank you.
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.
What?
Listen, my people are in great danger.
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,
who also happens to be my sister.
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...
I don't wanna fight your sister.
That's a family issue.
No, she's an evil being.
I don't care what she is.
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.
- What?
- I just told you.
If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.
And you don't care.
No, no. I'm putting together the team.
The Hulk is the fire.
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.
- What? No!
- It's gross.
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.
No! I don't even like the Hulk.
He's all like...
"Smash, smash, smash."
I prefer you.
Thanks.
But if I'm being honest,
when it comes to fighting evil beings,
he is very powerful and useful.
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
Is he though?
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.
What are you doing with that?
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?
Because you were naked.
Okay, I'll give you that.
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!
Tony wears his pants super tight.
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.
Maybe the fact that I was trapped
for two years
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.
Hey. It's okay.
You're good. Calm down. Come on.
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard
and you're not gonna have to think about
the Hulk ever again. All right?
All right.
This is bad.
Banner! Banner!
Banner!
Banner!
Thor!
Hi.
Hi.
I was gonna do that.
Yeah, well, I did it first.
That's good. What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.
I got sidetracked.
What's with the...
It's my disguise.
But I can see your face.
Not when I do this, you can't.
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did
with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?
What are those things on her eyes?
Are those people that she's killed?
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.
Who is this guy?
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too.
Look, I've spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.
Sakaar seemed like the best place
to drink and forget, and to die one day.
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.
I don't plan to stop drinking.
But I don't wanna forget.
I can't turn away anymore,
so if I'm gonna die,
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.
- Good.
- Yeah.
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.
Has it got a name?
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.
Revengers?
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.
Do you want revenge?
I'm undecided.
Okay.
Also, I've got a peace offering.
Surprise.
Just had to be sure.
Hello, Bruce.
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.
Where are you at these days?
It varies from moment to moment.
Is that a Dragonfang?
It is.
My God.
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
apart as any two known systems.
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.
Nope. We are going through the big one.
The Devil's Anus?
Anus?
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
We need another ship.
That will tear mine to pieces.
She's right. We need one that can
withstand the geodetic strain
from the singularity.
And has an offline
power steering system
that could also function
without the on board computer.
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.
What do you say?
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.
Talk about an adventure.
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.
There are one or two ships.
Absolute top of the line models...
I don't mean to impose...
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.
I may even have stolen the access codes
to his security system.
And suddenly you're overcome
with an urge to do the right thing.
Heavens, no.
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster,
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.
You're telling us that you can get us
access into the garage
without setting off any alarms?
Yes, brother. I can.
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.
He did try to kill me.
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.
There was one time
when we were children,
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.
So, I went to pick up the snake
to admire it,
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.
If we're boosting a ship
we're gonna need to draw some guards
away from the palace.
Why not set the beast loose?
Shut up.
You guys have a beast?
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.
We're going to start a revolution.
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.
Is that some sort of protoplasm,
all the stuff that's coming out of you,
or are they eggs?
Looks like eggs.
I'm looking for Korg.
Who's asking?
I know you're asking.
Is there anyone else asking,
or is it just you?
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.
The revolution has begun.
Revolution? How did this happen?
Don't know.
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated
and the slaves have armed themselves.
I don't like that word.
Which? Mainframe?
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?
No, the "S" word.
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.
Okay, that's better.
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.
I disagree.
Open communication
was never our family's forte.
You have no idea.
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.
Hello.
Hi.
Odin brought us together.
It's almost poetic that his death
should split us apart.
We might as well be strangers now.
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.
Here's the thing.
I'm probably better off staying here
on Sakaar.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Did you just agree with me?
Come on, this place is perfect for you.
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...
Brother, you're gonna do great here.
Do you truly think so little of me?
Loki, I thought the world of you.
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.
I don't know,
maybe there's still good in you.
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.
Yeah.
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.
It's what you always wanted.
Hey, let's do "Get Help."
- What?
- "Get Help."
No.
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.
- It's great. It works every time.
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.
We're doing it.
We are not doing "Get Help."
Get help! Please!
My brother, he's dying.
Get help! Help him!
Classic.
Still hate it.
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?
The Commodore.
Right.
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.
Loki.
I know I've betrayed you many times
before,
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.
Never one for sentiment, were you?
Easier to let it burn.
I agree.
That looks painful.
Dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.
I trust you, you betray me.
Round and round in circles we go.
See, Loki, life is about...
It's about growth.
It's about change.
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief,
but you could be more.
I'll just put this over here for you.
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.
All right, I can figure this out.
It's just another spaceship.
Loyal Sakaarians,
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship
and my favorite champion.
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.
Do not let him leave this planet.
- Good shot!
- Thanks.
Open the doors.
Okay.
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.
Why?
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?
Yes, we should.
Where are the guns on this ship?
There aren't any.
- It's a leisure vessel.
- What?
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,
orgies and stuff.
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?
Yeah.
Don't touch anything.
No!
- No!
- No!
Get inside!
In a minute.
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!
Okay, come on.
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.
That looks like a gun.
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
Yeah!
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!
There she is.
Our ticket out of here.
Hey, what's this?
Thank you.
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.
You wanna come?
You do seem like you're
in desperate need of leadership.
Why, thank you.
Here we go.
Shit.
Asgardians...
Some misguided soul
has stolen the Bifrost sword.
Tell us where it is
or there will be consequences.
Bad ones.
Well?
You.
Well? Executioner?
Wait!
Wait!
I know where the sword is.
I never thought I'd be back here.
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.
I mean, not that it's not nice.
It's just, it's on fire.
Here, up here in the mountains.
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.
She's coming for them.
Okay, drop me off at the palace
and I'll draw her away.
And get yourself killed?
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you
two to help get everyone off Asgard.
How the hell are we supposed to do that?
I have a man on the ground.
Asgard.
She's here.
Now the ship has a gun.
I'll take it from here.
I found this in the armory.
Good luck.
Your Majesty...
Don't die.
You know what I mean.
We must keep moving!
Go to the Bifrost!
Sister.
You're still alive.
I love what you've done with the place.
Redecorating, I see.
It seems our father's solution
to every problem was to cover it up.
Or to cast it out.
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.
You see?
You never knew him.
Not at his best.
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations
in blood and tears.
Where do you think all this gold
came from?
And then, one day,
he decided to become a benevolent king.
To foster peace, to protect life.
To have you.
I understand why you're angry.
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.
But it can't be you.
You're just the worst.
Okay, get up.
You're in my seat.
You know, Father once told me
that a wise king never seeks out war.
But must always be ready for it.
Go back!
Go!
To be honest, I expected more.
Heimdall!
The sword!
Here's the difference between us.
I'm Odin's firstborn,
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.
And you're nothing.
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.
Now you remind me of Dad.
The stupid dog won't die!
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.
You wanted to know who I am?
What the hell are you talking about?
You'll see!
You see? No one's going anywhere.
I'll get that sword,
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.
Hey, man.
I'm Korg. This is Miek.
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?
Your savior is here.
Did you miss me?
Everyone, on that ship now.
Welcome home. I saw you coming.
Of course you did.
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.
You see...
I'm not a queen or a monster.
I'm the Goddess of Death.
What were you the god of, again?
Even when you had two eyes,
you'd see only half the picture.
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.
It was never your source of strength.
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.
Asgard is not a place. Never was.
This could be Asgard.
Asgard is where our people stand.
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.
I'm not as strong as you.
No...
You're stronger.
Tell me, brother.
What were you the god of, again?
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.
This isn't over.
I think we should disband the Revengers.
Hit her with a lightning blast.
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.
It did nothing.
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.
It won't end there.
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.
She'll hunt us down.
We need to stop her here and now.
So what do we do?
I'm not doing "Get Help."
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.
Loki,
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.
This was about causing Ragnarok.
Surtur's crown, the vault.
It's the only way.
Bold move, brother.
Even for me.
Shall we?
After you.
This is madness.
Go! Go, now!
For Asgard.
Hela!
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
Hela, enough!
You want Asgard, it's yours.
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.
You can't defeat me.
No, I know.
But he can.
No.
Tremble before me, Asgard!
I am your reckoning!
The people are safe.
That's all that matters.
We're fulfilling the prophecy.
I hate this prophecy.
So do I, but we have no choice.
Surtur destroys Asgard,
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.
But we need to let him finish the job,
otherwise...
No!
Hulk, stop, you moron!
Hulk, stop.
Just for once in your life, don't smash.
Big monster!
Let's go!
Fine.
I am Asgard's doom!
The damage is not too bad.
As long as the foundations
are still strong,
we can rebuild this place.
It will become a haven
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.
What have I done?
You saved us from extinction.
Asgard is not a place...
It's a people.
It suits you.
Maybe you're not so bad after all,
brother.
Maybe not.
Thank you.
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.
I'm here.
Your throne.
So, King of Asgard.
Where to?
I'm not sure.
Any suggestions?
Miek, where are you from?
Miek's dead.
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him
on the bridge.
I've just felt so guilty,
I've been carrying him around all day.
Miek, you're alive!
He's alive, guys.
What was your question again, bro?
Earth it is.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to go back to Earth?
Yes, of course. The people of Earth
love me. I'm very popular.
Let me rephrase that.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to bring me back to Earth?
Probably not, to be honest.
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like
everything's gonna work out fine.
Oh, boy.
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.
Come on. No?
Me too.
'Cause I've been a big part of it.
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.
So, you're welcome.
And it's a tie.

Things are never gonna be
the same now.
I mean, look at this.
You got aliens.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.
Yeah. Tell you what, though.
It ain't bad, is it?
No. Yeah.
Kid's got a future.
Yeah, well...
...we'll see, I guess.
No, hey!
You can't saw through that stuff.
These alien bastards are tough.
You gotta use the stuff they use.
- See? All right.
- All right.
Oh, hey!
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.
Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.
This is a huge deal for us.
Attention, please!
In accordance
with Executive Order 396B...
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
Qualified personnel.
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so-
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under ou rjurisdiction.
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected...
...or you will be prosecuted.
Ma'am, what am-- ?
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.
Look...
...I bought trucks for this job.
I brought in a whole new crew.
These guys have a family.
I have a family.
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.
What'd you say?
Yeah.
He's right. I overextended myself.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.
Put them down.
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?
A joint venture between Stark Industries
and the government...
...the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection...
...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.
Yeah, it's all rigged.
Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material...
...scattered throughout the tri-state area.
Hey, chief!
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?
I ain't hauling it.
It's too bad.
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.
I tell you what.
Let's keep it.
The world's changing.
It's time we change, too.
There you go, Mason.
Business is good.
New York. Queens.
- t's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.
- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.
Then why are you narrating
in that voice?
- Because it's fun.
- Fun.
So why do they call you Happy?
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.
Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?
There's a bathroom on it.
No pilot? That's awesome.
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.
This is your first time
on a private plane?
My first time on any plane.
Should it-- ? Should it be-- ?
Should it be making that noise?
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.
Something about
Captain America going crazy.
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?
We're not roommates. Suit up.
Okay, Peter, you got this.
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.
- Where's the case?
- What case?
What? I thought that was a closet.
- This is still my room?
- Go.
- My room is way bigger than--
- There.
I found the case. I found the case.
"A minor upgrade"?
Oh, my God.
- Put it on.
- What the-- ?
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen--
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.
This is insane. Insane.
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.
Hey, everyone.
The craziest thing just happened.
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him--
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"
And then-- Hey, just a second!
coming!
L- ley-
We have thin walls here.
What are you doing, a little video diary?
- Yeah.
- It's all right.
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.
Hey. You know what?
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.
Three, two, one. Hey, May.
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...
...this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.
Everyone was impressed.
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.
That was a private conversation.
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.
- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line.
- Can you give us a moment?
- Want me to leave?
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.
I can keep the suit?
Yes, we were just talking about it.
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.
I've seen his cardiogram.
- All right?
- Yes.
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.
- This it?
- Seventh floor.
- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?
- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.
So when's our next-- ?
When's our next "retreat," you know?
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?
No, I mean, we'll call you.
Like, someone will call you. All right?
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.
Bye.
They're gonna call me.
What's up, Penis Parker?
Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.
Don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.
Do you have a date for homecoming?
Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Damn it. You, in my office right now.
Join me, and together...
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.
- What?
- So lame.
That's awesome. How many pieces?
Three thousand eight hundred and three.
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark--
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.
Always got that internship.
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.
Here's a gold coin."
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.
That'd be great.
I'm gonna be late.
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...
...between points A and B?
Flash.
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.
Nope. Peter. You still with us?
Yeah, yeah.
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.
You're dead.
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...
...but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing...
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.
Did Liz get a new top?
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.
Too late.
You guys are losers.
Well, then why do you sit with us?
Because I don't have any friends.
Next question.
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?
Hydrogen's the lightest.
That's not the question. Okay.
- Yeah.
- Uranium.
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.
Peter, it's nationals.
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.
Wait. What's happening?
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.
- No, no, no.
- Why not?
Really? Right before nationals?
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.
Flash, you're in for Peter.
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.
I got a hot date
with Black Widow coming up.
That is false.
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Delmar?
Hey, Mr. Parker.
Number five, right?
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.
You got it, boss.
How's your aunt?
Yeah, she's all right.
She's a very hot Italian woman.
How's your daughter?
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.
Here's 5 dollars.
What's up, Murph?
How you doing, buddy?
So how's school?
It's boring. Got better things to do.
Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.
Finally.
- What's the matter with you?
- Could you hold this?
Thanks.
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?
Everybody good?
Hey!
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?
Call me Spider-Man.
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.
- Yeah!
- Not bad.
Hey, buddy.
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumb-ass!
Hey! Shut that off!
- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was--
- I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!
- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know?
- He was putting that in the window!
- Every day with these alarms!
- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there, punk.
Hey, Gary. How you doing?
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?
I'm good, I'm good.
You have reached
the voice-mail box of:
Happy Hogan.
Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.
I just feel like I could be doing more.
You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.
So, yeah, just call me back.
It's Peter. Parker.
Why would I tell him about the churro?
Hey, hey-
Okay.
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.
Oh, nice.
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?
You're the Avengers.
What are you guys doing here?
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.
Hey"
Oh, this feels so weird.
What is that thing?
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.
911. What's your emergency?
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.
Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?
No. Wait, wait, wait!
Mr. Delmar.
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
ls anybody in here? Hello?
Oh, come on.
I gotta--
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.
Okay. Good. Yes.
Yes-- No. No, put that down.
That's worth more
than you or me. Yeah?
The craziest thing just happened.
These guys were robbing an ATM...
- ...with high-tech weapons--
- Take a breath. I don't have time...
- ...for ATM robberies...
- Yeah, but--
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.
Everything's gotta be out next week.
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?
Tony sold Avengers Tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate...
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?
What about you?
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?
- Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?
- Stay away from anything dangerous.
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?
I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap.
- My backpack's gone.
- That doesn't sound responsible.
- I'll call you back.
- Feel free not to.
What was that?
It's nothing. Nothing.
You're the Spider-Man.
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.
You can't just bust into my room!
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.
A thing to do after.
Okay.
Maybe put on some clothes.
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.
Mr. Stark knows
because he made my suit. That's it.
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?
Yeah, basically.
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.
Come on, Ned, please.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I-- Please.
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?
I swear.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
I can't believe this is happening now.
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.
Okay, well, wait, then.
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?
This is the Stark internship.
Just get out of here.
What's the matter?
Thought you loved larb.
It's too larby?
Not larby enough.
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?
You know I larb you.
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.
A lot of work.
The Stark internship.
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.
- Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...
- What does he have you doing?
- ...in an explosion...
- You need to use your instincts.
...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...
What?
...the Spider-Man.
As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...
...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.
Miraculously, no one was harmed.
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Six blocks away from us.
I need a new backpack.
- What?
- I need a new backpack.
That's five.
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.
It's on the house.
Thanks.
That's nice of him.
I think he larbs you.
You got bit by a spider?
Can it bite me?
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.
Maybe. How much did it hurt?
The spider's dead, Ned.
You were here?
Yeah.
You could've died.
Do you lay eggs?
What? No.
- Can you spit venom?
- No.
Can you summon an army of spiders?
No, Ned.
The Sokovia Accords were put
into place...
How far can you shoot your webs?
It's unknown. Shut up.
-- To begin regulating...
If I was you,
I would stand on a building...
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could--
- Shut up, Ned.
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.
...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.
- I stole his shield.
- What?
Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher...
...will conduct
the Captain America Fitness Challenge.
Thank you, Captain.
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.
It's required by the state. Let's do it.
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?
What does Hulk smell like?
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?
Ned, just...okay?
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset...
...telling the other guy where t0 go?
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- I don't need a guy in the chair.
Looking good, Parker.
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.
Well, what about the Spider-Man?
It's just Spider-Man.
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.
Oh, my God,
she's crushing on Spider-Man.
No way.
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.
Like, what if he's seriously burned?
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.
Peter knows Spider-Man.
No, I don't. No. I-- I mean--
They're friends.
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.
But it's...
...through the Stark internship.
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.
It's okay.
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?
What are you doing?
Helping you out.
Did you not hear her?
Liz has a crush on you.
Dude, you're an Avenger.
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.
House party in the suburbs.
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.
It'll be a night to remember.
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.
Yeah, it gives me confidence.
This is a mistake.
Hey, let's just go home.
Oh, Peter.
I know. I know it's really hard...
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.
It's flowering now.
He's so stressed out lately.
What helps with stress is a party.
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.
Peter.
- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.
Bye, May.
Dude, you have the suit, right?
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.
L- ley-
DJ Flash.
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in...
...say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.
Can't believe you're at this lame party.
But you're here too.
Am w.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.
I'm so happy you guys came.
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
- What a great party.
- Thanks.
Oh, I--
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta--
- Yeah.
- Have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Dude, what are you doing?
She's here. Spider it up.
No, no, no. I can't-- I cannot do this.
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.
Peter, no one wants that.
Dude.
Penis Parker, what's up?
So where's your pal Spider-Man?
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?
He must be around..."
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?
What the hell?
This sucks.
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.
Here. You try.
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.
I got antigrav climbers.
Yo, climbers?
Okay, what the hell is that?
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.
All right.
What was that?
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.
Did you just do it again?
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.
Toomes's phone.
Boss.
Oh, my butt!
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.
Hey, hey, buddy.
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.
Now, this is more like it.
Smells really good.
Great movie!
Oh, hey, guys.
NO! No!
Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.
Peter, where are you?
The hat's not working. This is not cool.
Almost got you.
Thought you got away from me,
didn't you?
I got you right where I want you.
Surprise!
What the hell?
Oh, hey.
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?
I put everything in your suit.
Including this heater.
That's better. Thanks.
What were you thinking?
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.
Take him down now, huh?
Crockett, there are people
who handle this son of thing.
- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.
Mr. Stark, you didn't have
to come out here.
I had that. I was fine.
Oh, I'm not here.
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...
...or you would be toast right now.
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.
Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.
- Why?
- Why?
Because I said so!
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.
Stay close to the ground.
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.
Can't you just be a friendly...
...neighborhood Spider-Man?
But I'm ready for more than that now.
No, you're not.
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.
Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.
Are you driving?
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.
I got some pull at MIT. End call.
No, I don't need to go to--
Mr. Stark is no longer connected.
That's awesome.
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."
- Penis!
- Parker!
- Penis!
- Parker!
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
Idiots.
Idiots.
Idiots!
Boss?
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?
Sorry. You left it out.
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?
You're still on that? I told you, no.
The answer's no. Forget it.
I mean, that was badass.
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.
Under the radar!
That's how we survive.
If you bring Damage Control
or the Avengers down here, we're through.
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars...
...calling yourself the Shocker.
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?
Whatever, old man. Come on.
Look.
Look.
I know you don't give a crap
about anything.
But I do.
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I can't afford your bullshit.
- Get out of here.
- What?
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.
All right.
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?
With everything I know.
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying...
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.
- You know what?
- What?
You're right.
- That work?
- I don't know.
I can't afford that.
Wait.
Damn.
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?
No, that's that one.
Here.
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.
All right.
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.
Yeah, well, something came up.
What is that?
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Awesome.
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.
So scary.
Well, look, I think it's...
...a power source.
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.
That's an inductive charging plate. That's
what I use to charge my toothbrush.
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey...
...into this amazing--
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.
We'll go to the lab after class
and run tests.
Let's do it.
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.
We gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy."
You're right.
Crap.
Come on, come on, come on.
High schools creep me out.
They got this funny smell, you know?
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.
What?
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.
- Peter--
- No. Stay there, Ned.
Peter.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Yeah. You good?
Chess.
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.
There's no sign of the weapon.
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.
This is so awesome.
I know, right?
They're in Brooklyn.
Staten Island.
Leaving Jersey.
They stopped.
Maryland?
- What's there?
- I don't know.
Evil lair?
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.
Badass.
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?
It's not too far from D.C.
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.
No, no way. You can't quit on us...
...stroll up and be welcomed back
by everyone.
Hey, welcome back!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.
- What?
- He's taking your place.
Excuse me, can we go already?
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.
Focus up.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.
The second law of thermodynamics.
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.
Liz, don't overwork them.
Strontium, barium, vibranium.
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.
Glad to be back.
- What is the current standard unit of-- ?
- Can I take this real quick?
Yeah, fine.
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker.
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...
...is a complete violation of privacy.
- That's different.
- What's different?
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.
- It's no big deal.
- Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.
You kidding me? This place is huge.
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?
Peter...
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?
I gotta follow these guys to their boss
before they move again...
...and I don't really want Mr. Stark
to know about it.
So you're lying to Iron Man now?
No, I'm not lying.
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.
Gotcha.
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here...
...but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.
What?
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.
- t's not cool.
- But you are a kid.
A kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.
I mean, what if this is illegal?
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.
I can handle it. Ned, come on.
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.
- Don't do that.
- Come on.
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.
- They're moving.
- Be careful.
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.
We're gonna go swimming.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.
L- ley-
I was-- I was gonna go study
in the business center.
You don't need to.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.
And besides...
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so--
I-- I heard it in a TED Talk.
And I read a coaching book.
You really--
This is really important to you.
Yeah. It's our future.
I'm not gonna screw it up.
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
Let's go.
- Good evening, Peter.
- Hello? Hello?
Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...
...and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.
Thank you.
Where would you like
to take me tonight?
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.
Tracker located.
Plotting course to intercept target.
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.
One hundred meters
from destination and closing.
Jump now.
Detecting three individuals.
Why is their secret lair
in a gas station? That's so lame.
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?
Do you want to hear
what they're saying?
I can hear what they're saying? Yeah.
Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design.
Whoa, that's so cool.
Can't believe they're still cleaning up
that Triskelion mess.
I love it. They keep making messes...
- ...we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.
They're in the middle of a heist.
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.
Okay, I'll get closer
to see what's happening.
Would you like me
to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?
"Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.
Activating instant Kill.
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.
Deactivating Instant Kill.
Did you hear that?
What the hell just happened?
What was that?
You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.
What's wrong with my web-shooters?
Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
- Would you like to see more options?
You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.
Mr. Stark really overdid it.
You two wait right here.
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?
- That one.
- Great choice.
Would you like me to set this
as your new default?
No, no, no.
- Push that in. No, the other--
- Here? This one here?
- What was that?
- Taser webs.
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.
You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.
Would you like to run
a refresher course?
- No. Just-- You choose.
- Sure thing.
Six-alpha-niner,
are you running on time?
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.
Oh, that's him.
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.
Pulling in behind the caboose.
Deploy anchors.
Dropping down.
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.
All right, coming up.
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.
Oh, God.
- Suit lady, what was that?!
- You told me to choose.
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.
Activating all systems.
My head.
You appear to have a mild concussion.
Hey, so where am I right now?
I'm not sure.
The container walls are hindering
my sensors.
Wait a minute.
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have
to fight our way out of this one.
Three, two, one.
What is this place?
Suit lady, where am I?
You're in the most secure facility
on the eastern seaboard.
The Damage Control deep storage vault.
No. Seriously?
The door will most likely remain closed
until morning.
Morning?
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?
I think I should probably give you a name.
Like Liz. No, no, no.
God, that's-- That's weird.
What about Karen?
You can call me Karen
if you would like.
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?
What?
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.
- Ricochet web.
- Ricochet web.
- Cool.
- Splitter web.
- Web grenade.
- Web grenade!
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?
Who is Liz?
Who's Liz? She's--
She's the best. She's awesome.
She's just a girl who goes to my school.
And--
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."
What's weird about that?
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.
Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.
Thanks, Karen.
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.
Hey, how long we been here anyways?
- Thirty-seven minutes-
- What?!
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.
I cannot take this anymore.
I got t0-- I gotta get out of here.
There's got t0 be something in here
I can use.
Okay, let's see.
Nope.
That's awesome.
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.
That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?
t would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.
No, no, no.
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.
Trial unsuccessful.
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.
Okay. Hold on, hold on.
Initiating trial 247.
It worked. It works.
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.
Thank you.
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.
Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.
- It's Ned. Leave a message.
- Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!
There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.
We have now entered sudden death.
The next correct answer wins
the championship.
Midtown Tech?
Zero.
That is correct.
Midtown takes the championship.
- We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just--
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by--
Okay.
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?
- t's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.
- Listen.
- We're at the Washington Monument.
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.
- Is that Liz?
- Put Ned back on the phone.
- You should tell her how you feel.
- You flake. You are lucky we won.
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.
- All items on the belt, please.
- There's something in Ned's backpack.
It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through x-ray.
Liz? Liz! Damn it.
Can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?
The Chitauri core has detonated...
...and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.
Just stay calm, everyone.
Oh, we are all going to die here.
Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.
We're freaking screwed.
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.
The safety systems
are completely failing.
We're very safe in here.
The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.
Going as fast as I can!
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.
You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.
What?! Why?
Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.
- How do I get in there?
- Activating reconnaissance drone.
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.
Locating optimal entry point.
Proceed to southwest window.
Karen, I'm on my way.
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Okay. Oh, my God.
Okay.
What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.
- Why are you hesitating?
- It's fine.
I've just never been this high before.
You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...
...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.
Perfect.
Oh, my God.
Why is it not breaking?
It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.
My friends are in there! Stop!
Return to the ground immediately.
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.
Stand down!
Return to the ground immediately.
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!
Go up, 90 UP-
I got this.
Take my trophy.
This is your last chance.
I'm gonna die.
Break!
I did it.
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Let's go, let's go!
Okay, Okay-
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.
- This is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.
Liz!
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay.
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.
- Come on in.
- You guys good?
So is everyone okay?
This is your chance, Peter.
Kiss her.
Thank you.
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck...
Yeah, damn it.
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?
Yeah, but then that's it.
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.
No.
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those...
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.
Really?
I'm gonna kill him.
- I'm gonna find him--
- Found him.
The Spider-Man swooped in...
...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.
The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.
Peter. Come here,
come here, come here.
This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...
...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.
Later that day,
they also defeated death.
Explosion. Salty scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.
There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.
As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.
I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.
Not again.
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.
How can you show your spider spirit?
Dude, dude, dude.
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.
Dude, listen, I figured it out.
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.
Ned, I'm probably never gonna
come back here.
Mr. Stark is moving
the Avengers upstate...
- ...so when I bring this guy in--
- Dude.
You want to be a high school dropout?
I am so far beyond high school right now.
Parker, my office.
So...
...you got detention.
You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.
The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?
Maybe you were trying to be cool.
But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...
...the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.
We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.
Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...
- ...you know is wrong...
- Where you going? Get back here.
...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.
It's you.
So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.
May?
Hey, Karen. What's up?
Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?
I was wondering if you could help me.
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.
I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.
- Footage?
- Yes, Peter.
I record everything you see.
- Everything?
- Everything.
- All the time?
- It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.
Yeah, of course it is.
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
- With pleasure.
Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.
Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.
Go later in the day, later in the day.
It is I, Thor, son of Odin.
No, no, no. That's definitely--
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.
- Your impressions are very funny.
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.
Okay.
- The two on the right, who are they?
- Searching law enforcement databases.
No records found
for two of the individuals.
Nothing'?
- One individual identified.
Aaron Davis, age 33.
He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.
Let's pay him a visit.
Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?
Yeah.
- Remember me?
- Hey--
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.
- All right, chill.
- Come on!
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man.
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl--
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?
I need to know. Give me names or else.
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.
Look, man.
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.
They can't be out on the streets.
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half--
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- It's too much bread.
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.
The other night, you told that dude,
"if you shoot somebody, shoot me."
That's pretty ballsy.
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.
I got a nephew who live here.
Who are these guys?
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.
I don't know who he is
or where he is.
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with...
...he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.
Yes! Yes.
- Thank--
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just--
Yeah.
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?
You got to get better
at this part of the job.
I don't understand.
I'm intimidating.
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.
No, no, no. Come fix this.
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.
Nice.
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
Sure thing.
He's up front, main deck.
I hate this guy.
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?
Just keep me posted.
There's no record of him
in my criminal database.
Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.
- Who's the guy on the left?
- Mac Gargan.
Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.
Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.
White pickup truck.
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.
Oh, this is too perfect.
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.
- Incoming call from Tony Stark.
- No, no, no.
Don't answer.
- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
- I'm actually at school.
- No, you're not.
- Nice work in D. C.
- Okay.
My dad never really gave me
a lot of support...
...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.
I'm in the middle of something.
Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.
Anyway, great things are about to-
What is that?
I'm at band practice.
That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?
- I gotta go. End call.
- Hey.
I'll take those!
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry
was at 10:30. You missed it.
Spider guy's here.
Not so fast.
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.
I got to say, the other guy was way better
with that thing.
I'm honestly--
I'm-- I'm shocked.
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.
What do you mean, FBI?
- The Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- I know, but what are they doing here?
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!
No.
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.
We're getting out of here.
Activate Taser web!
You're messing with things
you don't understand.
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.
Web grenade. Web grenade.
Splitter web, go.
Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!
No, no, no.
What the hell?
What the hell?
Hi, Spider-Man.
Band practice, was it?
Yeah, Iron Man!
Mr. Stark.
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?
I think you've done enough.
So that's it. You're just gonna run?
Feds were waiting for us.
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?
Yeah, I'm running.
You should too.
You know I can't do that.
So now what?
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?
Seriously?
Yes. You will not regret this.
You in?
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch...
.../ tell you to stay away from this.
Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...
...so you could sneak around
behind my back...
...doing the one thing
I told you not to do.
ls everyone okay?
No thanks to you.
No thanks to me?
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...
...but you didn't listen.
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.
And if you died...
...I feel like that's on me.
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.
I just wanted to be like you.
And I wanted you to be better.
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.
- For how long?
- Forever.
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.
- Let's have it.
- Please, this is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Okay?
God, I sound like my dad.
I don't have any other clothes.
Okay, we'll sort that out.
L- ley-
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.
You can't do that.
Then this ferry thing happens.
I've called five police stations.
Five.
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.
Cut the bullshit.
I know you left detention.
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.
That's not fine.
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.
It's just me and you.
I lost the Stark internship.
- What?
- Yeah.
What happened?
I just thought that I could work really hard
and he could-- He would-- You know.
But I screwed it up.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I made you worry.
I'm not trying to ruin your life.
Yeah, I know.
Just--
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.
And take a shower. You smell.
You smell like garbage.
I know.
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?
Okay.
All right, get out of here.
Are you expelled?
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.
You're so lucky.
L- ley-
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.
Hey, look, I--
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.
It's fine.
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.
No, I'm--
I just mean that...
...it was not cool, especially...
...because...
...I like you.
I know.
You do?
You're terrible at keeping secrets.
Yeah, you'd be surprised.
I got to get to class, but--
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...
...forever, but--
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so--
Do you want to...
...go with me?
Yeah. Sure.
Really? I mean, great. Cool.
Cool.
I'm actually going that way.
May, I need your help.
Through or around?
Right?
It's game day. So, what's the plan?
Open the door for her.
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.
- Don't be creepy.
- No.
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.
I got this.
- Love you.
- Bye.
You must be Peter.
Yeah.
I'm Liz's dad.
Put her there.
Hell of a grip.
Come on in here. Come on.
Hi, Peter.
You look very handsome.
Thank you.
You got his name right?
- Freddie?
- Peter.
Peter. Peter.
I'm gonna go get Liz.
Okay.
You all right, Pete?
Yeah.
Because you look pale.
You want something to drink?
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?
I'm not old enough to drink.
That's the right answer.
- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.
Doesn't she, Pete?
Yeah, you look really good.
Once again, that's the right answer.
Is that a corsage?
Thanks.
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.
Okay. Come on, you guys.
Peter, closer.
Smile.
There you go.
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.
I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.
- Thank you.
- Promise.
He's cute.
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.
Come on, Pedro.
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.
Just saying, you know.
All you guys who go to that school...
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.
Really? Stark?
So cool.
What do you do?
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got...
...boring.
It was boring?
You got to hang outwith Spider-Man.
Really? Spider-Man?
What's he like?
Yeah, he's nice.
Nice man.
Solid dude.
Look. So cute.
I've seen you around, right? I mean...
...somewhere. We've-- Have we ever-- ?
Because even the voice--
He does Academic Decathlon with me.
And he was at my party.
It was a great party, really great, yeah.
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.
That was-- I was there longer
than two seconds.
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.
Were you scared?
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...
...showed up in the elevator though, huh?
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.
I saw it all from the ground.
Yeah.
Very lucky that he was there that day.
Good old Spider-Man.
Dad, the light.
Here we are. End of the line.
Thanks, Dad.
You head in there, gumdrop.
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.
Don't let him intimidate you.
Love you.
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.
Hi.
You guys look so pretty.
Does she know?
Know what?
So she doesn't. Good.
Close t0 the vest.
I admire that.
I've got a few secrets of my own.
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...
Peter...
...nothing is more important than family.
You saved my daughter's life.
I could never forget something like that.
So I'm gonna give you one chance.
Are you ready?
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...
...and don't you ever, ever...
...interfere with my business again.
Because if you do...
...I'll kill you...
...and everybody you love.
I'll kill you dead.
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?
L- ley-
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?
Just not too good.
L- ley-
What did he say to you?
Gotta go.
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this.
He gave you a choice.
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?
What's with the crappy costume?
My web-shooters.
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but damn.
Gross.
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.
Nice shot!
Yes!
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.
Get a computer and track my phone.
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...
...before he leaves town.
I'm sorry about dinner...
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So--
Flash, I need your car and phone.
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't--
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?
- Go for Ned.
- Ned, I need you...
- ...to track my phone.
- Yeah, but where is it?
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. it's--
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move!
Are you okay'?
- I've never driven before...
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.
Hey, have you gotten through
to Happy yet?
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
Guy in the chair.
Takeoff in nine minutes.
Hello? Hello? Who Is this?
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
- Who?
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you--
You gotta be shitting me.
Damn.
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.
Left, okay.
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.
It sounded like he was catching a flight.
He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.
- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.
Boxes? It's moving day.
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.
I gotta stop him!
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster Armor...
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging--
The Meg-- The--
Thor's magic belt.
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.
- What?
- Turn right.
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.
I'm...
...looking...
...at porn.
Hey!
Surprised?
Oh, hey, Pete.
I didn't hear you come in.
It's over. I've got you.
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...
...I really, really admire your grit.
I see why Liz likes you.
I do. When you first came to the house...
...I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.
How could you do this to her?
To her?
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.
I'm doing this for her.
Yeah.
Peter...
...you're young.
You don't understand
how the world works.
But I understand that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.
How do you think
your buddy Stark paid for that tower?
Or any of his little toys?
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.
Guys like us...
...like you and me...
...they don't care about us.
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.
That's how it is.
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to understand.
And...
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.
I'm sorry, Peter.
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.
True. Then again...
...wasn't really trying to.
Chief, they're powering up engines.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, ready?
Hello?
Hello!
Please, hey.
Hey, please. I'm down here.
I'm down here. I'm stuck.
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't--
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Come on, Peter.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man!
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.
Oh, yeah.
Retroreflective panels engaged.
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.
It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.
Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.
This better work, Mason.
Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life.
Yeah.
You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...
...and override their security.
Cloning transponder signal.
Launching decoy drone.
Entering new coordinates.
Good, so it's on its way.
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.
All right.
Hot dog.
Just a typical homecoming...
...on the outside of an invisible jet...
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.
Oh, God!
I can't believe that worked.
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.
I'm not going home empty-handed.
Oh, my God.
- Get out of there. What are you doing?
- Please turn, please turn!
Hey, Pedro.
Bingo.
Your wingsuit.
Your wingsuit's going to explode!
Time to go home, Pete.
I'm trying to save you!
No.
No.
It looked so insane. That whole--
Like, it was just crazy.
He-- He was just, like...
And you were like...
And then I just hit him with the...
It was so-- Oh, my God.
I mean, you saved me.
It was awesome.
Hey, Liz.
I'm gonna miss you.
Bye.
Liz.
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?
The dance?
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.
Well, yeah, but I--
I mean, your dad-- I can't imagine
what you're going through.
If there's anything I can do to help...
I guess we're moving to Oregon.
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So...
Liz, I-- I--
Bye, Peter.
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.
Yeah!
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...
...but just for motivation right now
at this practice.
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...
...a new team captain next year.
So I am appointing Michelle.
Yeah!
Thank you.
My-- My friends call me MJ.
I thought you didn't have any friends.
I didn't.
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?
What are you hiding, Peter?
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.
Hey, Happy. What-- ?
What are you doing here?
I really owe you one.
I don't know what I would do
without this job.
I mean, before I met Tony--
So how long you been here?
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.
Upstate-- Like, upstate-upstate?
Yeah, let's go.
Take a look.
It's pretty impressive, huh?
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.
How was the ride up?
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
I gotta talk to the kid.
I'll be close behind.
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.
Sorry I took your suit.
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...
...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.
- Mr. Stark, I really--
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.
But then you did the right thing.
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...
All right, not my best analogy.
I was wrong about you.
I think, with a little more mentoring...
...you could be a real asset to the team.
- To the-- ? To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.
When you're ready...
...why don't you try that on?
And I'll introduce the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:
Spider-Man.
'Can-
Yeah, give that a look.
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...
...your new quarters.
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.
Or walls.
You'll fit right in.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
But I'm good.
You're good? Good-- ?
How are you good?
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?
You're turning me down?
You better think about this.
Look at that.
Look at me.
Last chance. Yes or no?
- No.
- Okay.
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.
Happy will take you home.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.
- See you around.
- Okay.
That was a test, right?
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
Yeah, thank you.
Told you he's a good kid.
- Where's the kid?
- He left.
- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?
Think of something. How about...?
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I-- ? I-- ?
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?
I've been carrying this since 2008.
Okay.
I think I can think
of something better than that.
Well, it would buy us a little time.
Like we need time.
I can't believe you have that
in your pocket.
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?
May?
What 'the-l?!
Look who it is.
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?
Relax.
This? It's not on you.
It's on our little spider friend.
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.
And I heard a rumor.
You know who he is.
If I knew who he was...
...he'd already be dead.
Toomes, your family's here!
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.
Patience.
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.
Sometimes it leads to very little...
...and it seems like it's not worth it.
And you wonder...
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.
How many more of these?

Who am I? You sure you want to know?
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...
... if somebody told you I was just an
average ordinary guy, not a care in the world...
... somebody lied.
But let me assure you, this
like any story worth telling...
... is all about a girl.
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.
The woman I've loved
since before I even liked girls.
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.
Hey! Stop the bus!
That's me.
Tell him to stop! Please!
Stop!
Hey! Stop the bus!
Stop the bus! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Blvd.
Catch a cab, Parker!
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
What a geek!
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.
Would you date him?
Midtown High seniors.
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.
So behave accordingly.
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.
Come on, stay together.
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.
- Dad would you ask Hoskins to drive around the corner please.
- Why?
The entrance is right there.
Dad these are public school kids,
I'm not showing up for the field trip in a Rolls.
You want me to trade in my care for a Jetta
just because you flunked out of every private school I ever sent you to?
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.
It's just...
Just what, Harry?
Forget it.
Pete!
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Harry! Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks Dad.
- Um, Peter may I introduce my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.
- It's a great honour to meet you sir.
- Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.
Y'know, I'm something of a scientist myself.
I read all your research on nanotechnology.
Really Brilliant.
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.
- I live with my aunt and uncle, they are proud.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.
I think he wants to adopt you.
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.
That's amazing!
This is the most advanced electron
microscope in the eastern seaboard.
It's unreal.
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...
...varying strengths which help them
in their constant search for food.
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.
For the school paper?
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...
...genus Kukulcania.
It spins an intricate funnel shaped web whose strands
have a tensile strength
...proportionately equal to the type of high tension wire...
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?
Or his father will fire your father.
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?
What is going on?
The next person who talks
will fail this course. I kid you not.
- This grass spider...
- Let's go.
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...
...that some researchers believe
it almost borders on precognition.
-Those guys are jerks.
-...an imminent awareness of danger...
A spider-sense.
Hey, look at that spider.
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.
It's a defense mechanism.
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?
Who wouldn't?
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility has...
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.
I love them!
Yeah, me too.
You know, spiders can change
their color...
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.
...transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...
...combining the genetic
information from all three...
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.
There's 14.
I beg your pardon?
- One's missing.
- Yeah.
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the eastern seaboard?
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.
Let's talk about how we listen.
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...
...but at Midtown High...
Hey, Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.
- Sure, yeah.
- Great.
Where do you want me?
Over here?
Yeah, that's great.
Don't make me look ugly.
That's impossible.
Perfect.
- Is that good?
- Great.
That's great.
M.J., let's go!
Wait. Thanks!
Parker, let's do it.
We've solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.
I've already seen the glider.
That's not what I'm here for.
General Slocum, good to see you again.
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors pay us a little visit.
I want to see the progress report on
Human performance enhancers.
We tried vapour inhalation with rodent subjects.
They showed an 800 percent increase in strength.
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?
-In one trial yes.
-It was an aberration.
All the tests since
have been successful.
In the trial that went wrong, what happen?
what were the side effects?
Violence, aggression...
...and insanity.
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.
With the exception of Dr. Strom our entire staff
certifies the product
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.
I'm going to be frank with you.
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.
Norman, the General gave the go-ahead
to request aerospace
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your so-called performance enhancers
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.
Gentlemen. Ladies.
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voil! There is light.
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.
I'm already on my ass, May.
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.
Hand me that dish. The green one.
The corporation is downsizing
the people...
...and upsizing their profits.
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?
Computer...
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.
I love you. And Peter loves you.
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.
How you doing? How was the field trip?
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.
- You won't have a bite?
- No thanks, had a bite.
Did you get some pictures, Peter?
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
What's that all about?
In this recombination lab...
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...
...combining the genetic
information from all three...
... into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.
The data just doesn't justify
this test.
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.
Don't be a coward.
Risks are part of laboratory science.
Let me reschedule,
with the proper medical staff and a volunteer.
- If you just give me two weeks...
- Two weeks?
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.
Oh, that's cold.
Norman?
Norman!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Norman!
Back to formula?
Weird.
- Peter?
- Yeah?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?
Yep. Big change.
- Well, hurry up. You're going to be late.
- Right.
Okay.
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.
- I got better.
- See?
- Bye, guys.
- You haven't eaten anything, have you got your lunch money?
- Yeah I've got it.
Hey Michaelangelo don't forget
we're painting the kitchen right after school. Got it?
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.
And don't start up with me.
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.
You're trash!
You're always going to be trash just like her.
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?
Hi, M.J.
Hey, M.J.
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?
I got the car. Hop in.
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.
Or not.
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!
Tell him to stop.
- Check him out!
- Dork!
Dad!
Dad, are you all right?
Harry.
What are you doing on the floor?
I don't know.
Have you been there all night?
Last night I was...
What?
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.
What?
They found his body this morning
in the lab. He's been murdered, sir.
- What are you talking about?
- And the flight suit and the glider...
- What about it?
- It's been stolen, sir.
Wow! Great reflexes!
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.
You just get contacts?
Well, see you.
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.
Did you see that?
Parker?
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny don't you, freak?
- Flash it was just an accident.
-My fist breaking your teeth is the accident.
-C'mon Flash, stop.
-I don't want to fight you Flash.
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.
Help him, Harry.
How'd he do that?
Which one?
He's all yours, man.
Flash, get up!
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.
That was amazing.
I'm out of here. Come on.
Go, web!
Fly.
Up, up and away, web.
Shazam!
Go! Go!
Go, web, go!
Tallyho.
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?
Bring me some beer.
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!
You're as stupid as your mother.
Where's she going?
Where you going?
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!
- Were you listening to that?
- No.
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.
I guess you can always hear us.
Everybody shouts.
Your aunt and uncle don't.
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...
You really freaked us out.
I'm sorry. Is he okay?
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.
So where are you going
after you graduate?
I wanna move into the city.
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.
Work my way through college.
What about you?
Headed for the city too.
Can't wait to get out of here.
I wanna...
What?
No, come on. Try me.
I wanna...
...act...
...on-stage.
Really?
Oh, that's perfect.
You were awesome
in all the school plays.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.
Peter, that was first grade.
Well...
...even so.
Sometimes...
...you know people.
You can just see what's coming.
What do you see coming for you?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.
And what for me?
For you?
You're gonna light up Broadway.
You know...
...you're taller than you look.
I hunch.
Don't.
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.
Come on.
I gotta go.
Bye.
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.
- Look at it!
- Hop in.
Oh, my God. What a cool car!
Pretty tight, huh?
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.
Cool car.
What's going on in there?
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.
Okay. Thanks.
Something's bothering him.
Maybe he's too embarrased to tell me what it is.
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.
I don't know, I just don't know anymore.
I'm going to the downtown library,
I'll see you later.
- Wait. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- I'll take the train.
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go, go.
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Now wait a minute, we need to talk.
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?
Because we haven't talked at all for so long,
your Aunt May and I don't even know who you are any more.
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.
- You start fights at school.
- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
- Well you sure as hell finished it.
- What was I supposed to do, run away?
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...
But, Pete look, you're changing. I know,
I went through exactly the same thing at your age.
No. Not exactly.
Peter... these are the years
when a man changes...
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.
Just be careful who you change into.
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.
But just because you can
beat him up...
...doesn't give you the right to.
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.
Are you afraid that I'm going to turn into some
kind of criminal? Quit worrying about me, okay?
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing, please.
I don't mean to lecture and I don't mean to
preach. And I know I'm not your father--
Then stop pretending to be!
Right.
I'll pick you up here at 1 0.
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.
For $3000...
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?
Who?
I know who.
The Flying Dutchman!
Next.
There's no featherweight
division here smallfry. Next.
No, no. Sign me up.
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain while participating in said event
and you are indeed participating of your own free will?
- Yes.
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.
Told you! Told you!
Winner!
Next victim!
Are you ready for more?
Bone Saw is ready!
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.
The Human Spider? That's it.
That's the best you got?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
...the terrifying, the deadly...
...the amazing Spiderman!
- My Name's the Human Spider.
- I don't care, get out there.
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.
I hope you brought your mommy.
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my legs!
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Cage! Cage! Cage!
Cage!
Hello? Guys?
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?
Hey listen! This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!
Hey, freak show!
You're going nowhere.
I got you for three minutes.
Three minutes of playtime.
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?
Finish him off!
Smash him!
- Hit him!
- Harder!
Kick his spider ass!
Hit him!
One, two, three!
That's it! That's it!
Winner!
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spiderman!
Now get out of here.
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.
Well, check it again, webhead.
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.
I need that money.
I missed the part
where that's my problem.
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.
Hurry up!
Hey! He stole the gate!
Stop that guy!
Stop him! He's got my money!
Thanks.
What the hell's the matter with you,
you let him go!
Cut him off and call the cops!
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he's going to get away with my money.
I missed the part
where that's my problem.
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?
Old dude, man.
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.
Uncle Ben?
Uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben?
Peter.
I'm here, Uncle Ben.
Peter.
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.
Get a unit to the rear!
I got the back!
Who's there?
Don't hurt me. Just give me a chance.
Just give me a chance!
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?
Answer me!
Stop that guy!
Thanks.
See you.
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.
Oh, no. My God.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, General Slocum.
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
- He's clear! Go!
- I assume you're confident about this test.
Absolutely, Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?
Nothing would please me more
than to put Norman Osborn out of business.
Preflight complete. Mark.
We are picking up an
unidentified object closing fast.
What the hell is that?
Can you see anything?
Oh, my God!
- Say "chess."
- Chess!
Peter!
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.
Pete. Good news. My Father got the place in
New York so we're all set this Friday.
- Oh that's great!
- You made it.
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.
Yeah.
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.
Commencement:
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.
You know what? Whatever.
Your loss.
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.
Can I fix you something?
No, thanks.
I missed him a lot today.
I know.
I miss him too.
But he was there.
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.
You loved him...
...and he loved you.
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.
How you were meant for great things.
You won't disappoint him.
With great power
comes great responsibility.
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.
Hurry up!
This is not a man. My brother saw him building a
nest in the Lincoln Center fountain.
They think he's human.
They think he's a man. Could be a woman.
Bobby. Get a load of this!
He throws up his hands, ropes come out, and
he climbs up the ropes like a spider web.
I see the web and it's a signature,
and I know Spiderman was here.
The guy protects us, you know
protects the people.
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wakadoo.
He stinks and I don't like him.
Don't move, lady!
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.
Those tights and that tight little...
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug
But we should all just give him
One big hug
Look out
Here comes the Spiderman
"Who is Spiderman?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?
Mr. Jameson your wife is on line one
she needs to know if--
- Mr. Jameson there's a page six problem.
-We have a page one problem, shut up.
- Well?
- He's news.
- These are really important clients they can't wait.
- They're about to.
- He pulled six people off that subway car.
- Sure from a wreck he probably caused.
Something goes wrong and this creepy-crawler is there.
Look at that, he's fleeing the scene. What's that tell you?
He's not fleeing, he's probably going to
save somebody else. He's a hero!
Then why's he wear a mask, hmm?
What's he got to hide?
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille in the dining room.
- Whichever's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson it's like this,
We double-booked page six. See so both
Macy's and Conway's have three-quarters of the same page.
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?
Every copy.
Tomorrow morning. Spiderman. Page one with a decent
picture this time. Move Conway to page seven.
- That's a problem.
- Make it page eight and give 'em 10 percent off.
No make it 5 percent.
- That can't be done.
- Get outta here!
Problem is we don't have a decent picture.
Eddie's been on it for weeks, we can barely get a glimpse of him.
Aw, what is he, shy?
We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong
we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo.
Put an ad on the front page.
"Cash money for a picture of Spiderman"
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!
Buzz off.
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm begging for a job. How about you?
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting now?
Yeah.
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.
That's great MJ.
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Hey counter girl!
Your drawer was short six dollars!
Next time that happens,
I'm gonna take it outta your cheque!
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
It better not happen no more, hear me?.
Don't roll your eyes at me.
Some dream, huh?
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
Oh, yeah. Right.
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.
No, I guess not.
Thanks, Pete.
We should catch up sometime.
Let's get some lunch some evening.
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.
I won't.
I won't tell Harry.
Timing's perfect. Hey.
Five new contracts. It'll be great.
Stormin' Norman's making his weekly inspection.
Spent half of it on the phone.
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.
Are you all right?
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.
You were late again?
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?
Around.
Peter Parker.
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.
- When do I get to meet her?
- Dad!
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?
Dad, maybe you can help him out.
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.
I couldn't accept it. I'd like to earn
what I get. I can find my own work.
I respect that.
You want to make it on your own steam.
That's great.
What other skills do you have Parker?
I was thinking of something in photography.
Hello.
Let's go! Move it!
Watch the street!
Cheese!
They're crap.
Crap, crap. Megacrap.
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.
Take them somewhere else then.
- Sir your wife said that tile you want in the foyer is out of stock.
- Tell her we'll just put a rug there.
Sit down. Give me that.
I'll give you 300.
That's a standard freelance fee.
- Tear up page one. Run that photo instead.
- Headline?
"Spiderman, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."
- Menace? He was protecting that--
- Tell you what, Atticus you take the pictures
I'll make up the headlines, ok? all right?
That ok with you.
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.
Bring me some more shots of that newspaper selling clown,
maybe I'll take 'em off your hands.
But I never said you have a job. Meat.
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Best I can do. Get outta here.
Bring me more photos.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.
- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.
I'm Peter Parker.
I'm a photographer.
Yes. I can see that.
As of today...
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...
...costs are down, revenues are up...
...and our stock
has never been higher.
Wonderful news, Norman. Woderful.
In fact, it's the reason for selling the company.
What?
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing
in the wake of the bombing. Expanding.
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.
Why wasn't I told?
The last thing they want is a power struggle
with entrenched management.
The deal is off if you come with it.
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.
You can't do this to me.
I started this company.
You know how much I sacrificed?!
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.
I'm sorry.
You're out, Norman.
Am I?
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.
I think you're beautiful.
MJ would you do me a favour?
I forgot my drink inside.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.
What is that?
That's our glider!
What the hell was that?
Code three! Code three!
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!
Harry! Help me! Harry!
Out, am I?
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!
Hello, my dear.
It's Spiderman!
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!
Somebody help him!
No!
Mommy!
- Hold it right there!
- I surrender.
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!
Impressive.
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!
Hold on!
Watch out!
We'll meet again, Spiderman!
Hold on Mary Jane!
Well, beats taking the subway.
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.
Wait.
Who are you?
- You know who I am.
- I do?
Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'm going to come over.
No, I'm gonna come...
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?
And we'll go and have breakfast and...
...I want to buy you something.
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs...
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.
You're right.
I didn't.
I'm gonna get some rest.
I'm gonna stay up for a while.
What was that thing?
I don't know.
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.
Somebody there?
Somebody.
Somebody.
Who said that?
Don't play the innocent with me.
You've known all along.
Where are you?
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.
I'm right here.
I don't understand.
Did you think it was coincidence?
So many good things,
all happening for you.
All for you. Norman.
What do you want?
To say what you won't.
To do what you can't.
To remove those in your way.
The board members.
You killed them.
We killed them.
We?
Remember?
Your little accident
in the laboratory.
The performance enhancers.
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:
Power beyond your wildest dreams.
And it's only the beginning.
There's only one who can stop us.
Or imagine if he joined us.
Spiderman. And the Green Goblin.
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.
- These weirdo's all gotta have a name now.
- Mr. Jameson Spiderman...
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?
Call the patent office, copyright the name Green Goblin,
I want a quarter every time somebody says it.
How about "Green Meanie"?
Spiderman wasn't attacking the city he was
trying to save it. That's slander.
It is not. I resent that.
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.
You don't trust anybody, that's your problem.
I trust my barber.
What are you his lawyer? Get out of here!
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...
Jameson, you slime.
Who's the photographer who takes the
pictures of Spiderman?
- I don't know who he is. His stuff comes in the mail.
- Liar!
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.
Set him down, tough guy.
- Speak of the devil.
- Spiderman! I knew you two were in this together.
Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?.
Sleep...
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.
No, you're not dead yet.
Just paralyzed...
...temporarily.
You're an amazing creature,
Spiderman.
You and I are not so different.
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.
Well, to each his own.
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.
Why bother?
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.
There are eight million people
in this city.
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.
You, me...
...we're exceptional.
I could squash you like a bug
right now.
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.
What we could create.
Or we could destroy.
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?
Think about it, hero.
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.
It's me again.
How was your audition?
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...
...told my aunt, told me.
So you just came by?
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...
So how'd it go?
They said I needed acting lessons.
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.
I'd like a cheeseburger.
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.
Come with us.
No, thanks. How's it going with...?
Never mind.
That's none of my business.
It's not?
Why so interested?
I'm not.
You're not?
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.
Why would you be?
I, that's a...
I don't know.
Sorry you won't come with us.
I'd better run, tiger.
Hey, check it out, man.
Come on, man.
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!
Get off me!
Wait!
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.
I was in the neighborhood.
You are amazing.
Some people don't think so.
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.
Do I get to say thank you this time?
Wait.
I have to get in there! My baby's in there!
My baby's in there!
- Let me go!
- I can't let you in there, the roof's about to collapse.
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!
Look! Up there!
Save my baby, please!
No!
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!
God bless you, Spiderman.
Bless you.
Don't let him get away!
Hold it right there! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!
I'm going.
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back chief.
Go! Go!
Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out of here!
It's okay.
You're pathetically predictable.
Like a moth to the flame.
What about my generous proposal?
Are you in or are you out?
- It's you who's out Gobby. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.
Oh, great.
No one says no to me!
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.
He's here.
Are you ready?
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.
Who is this lovely young lady?
I'd like you to meet my father Norman Osborn.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
How do you do?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.
Peter?
Is that you?
How strange. There's nobody here.
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!
Sorry I'm late.
It's a jungle out there.
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...
...and we can say grace.
Here we go.
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.
Will you do the honors?
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
Oh, yeah, I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.
Well, let me see.
Oh, my goodness.
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving in this apartment
and we are going to do things properly.
How did you say that happened?
Bike messenger.
Knocked me down.
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.
- Why?
Something has come to my attention.
Are you all right?
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!
Dad, what are you doing?
I plan this whole thing so you can meet MJ
and now you've got to leave?
I've got to go.
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.
Do you think a woman like that is sniffing
around because she likes your personality?
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.
They're all beautiful until they're snarling after
your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
You're wrong about her Dad.
A word to the not so wise about your little girlfriend,
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.
That creep is my father, all right
If I'm lucky I'll become half of what he is
so just keep your mouth shut
about stuff you don't understand.
Harry Osborn!
I'm sorry, Aunt May.
Spiderman is all but invincible.
But Parker, we can destroy him.
I can't.
Betrayal must not be countenanced.
Parker must be educated.
What do I do?
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.
Yes?
And then grant his wish.
But how?
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.
Tell me how!
The heart, Osborn.
First, we attack his heart.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...
Deliver us!
Finish it!
- Finish it!
- From evil!
Two milligrams IV.
Get the BP.
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?
Yes she's going to be ok.
Look you're going to have to leave right now.
- What happened?
- Those eyes!
Those horrible yellow eyes!
He knows who I am.
I'm sorry.
- Will she be okay?
- She's going to be fine.
She's been sleeping all day.
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.
How are you?
You okay about the other night?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.
I haven't called him back.
The fact is...
...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?
At least I think I am.
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.
Would I know his name, this guy?
You'll think I'm a stupid little
girl with a crush.
Trust me.
It's funny.
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say about him?
No, no, not Spiderman,
not a chance in the world.
I know him a little bit.
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.
What'd he say?
I said...
He asked me what I thought about you.
And what did you say?
I said, "Spiderman."
I said, "The great thing about M. J...
...is...
...when you look in her eyes...
...and she's looking back in yours...
...everything feels...
...not quite normal.
Because you feel...
...stronger...
...and weaker at the same time.
You feel excited...
...and at the same time...
...terrified.
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.
It's as if you've...
...reached the unreachable...
...and you weren't ready for it."
You said that?
Well, something like that.
Dad?
Dad, is that you?
What is it?
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.
She's in love with Peter.
- Parker?
- Yeah.
And how does he feel about her?
He's loved her since the 4th grade.
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.
I'm so sorry.
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.
That's no excuse.
I'm proud of you.
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you, Harry.
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.
Wake up, little spider.
Wake up.
Go home, dear.
You look awful.
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.
A smile. Finally.
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.
Hey, you were supposed to be asleep.
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J. 's family moved in next door.
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, aunt May, is that an angel?"
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.
Well, Harry's in love with her.
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.
You're so mysterious all the time.
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?
Everybody else knows.
I'll be right back.
But...
Come on, pick up.
- Hey M.J.
-Hi. Sing your song at the beep.
M.J., it's Peter. You there?
Hello? You there?
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?
All right, well...
Don't...
Don't go up any dark alleys.
Hello?
Can Spiderman come out to play?
Where is she?
- What is that?
- That's cool!
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out
Goblin, what have you done?
Spiderman!
This is why only fools are heroes.
Because you never know...
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:
Let die the woman you love...
...or suffer the little children.
- Spiderman!
- Save us!
Save us!
Make your choice, Spiderman...
...and see how a hero is rewarded.
Don't do it, Goblin!
We are who we choose to be.
- Now, choose!
- No!
Everybody stay still!
Ahoy up there!
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!
M.J., you can do it. You have to.
Trust me.
Hold on tight and go quickly.
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.
Hang on, Mary Jane!
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!
It's time to die.
Come on up here dumb gu
I got a little something for ya.
Leave Spiderman alone.
You gonna pick on a guy trying to save a bunch of kids?
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!
Spiderman, watch out!
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.
I offered you friendship...
...and you spat in my face.
You've spun your last web, Spiderman.
Had you not been so selfish, your little
girlfriend's death
...would have been quick and painless.
But now that you've really
pissed me off...
...l'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.
M.J. and I...
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.
Peter, stop!
Stop! It's me.
Mr. Osborn.
Peter, thank God for you.
You killed those people
on that balcony.
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!
Don't let him take me again.
I beg you. Protect me.
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.
But not you.
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.
I would never hurt you.
I knew from the beginning...
...if anything ever happened to me...
...it was you I could count on.
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.
Thank God for you.
Give me your hand.
Believe in me
as I believed in you.
I've been like a father to you.
Be a son to me now.
I have a father.
His name was Ben Parker.
Godspeed, Spiderman.
Peter.
Don't tell Harry.
What have you done?
What have you done?!
I'm so sorry, Harry.
I know what it's like
to lose a father.
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.
One day Spiderman will pay.
I swear on my father's grave,
Spiderman will pay.
Thank God for you, Peter.
You're the only family I have.
No matter what I do...
... no matter how hard I try...
... the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.
You must miss him so much.
It's been so hard without him.
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.
When I was up there...
...and I thought I was gonna die...
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
It was you, Pete.
I kept thinking:
"I hope I make it through this...
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."
Really?
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...
...who makes me feel...
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.
That I'm just...
...me.
And that's okay.
The truth is...
...I love you.
I love you so much, Peter.
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.
I can't...
You can't what?
Tell you...
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.
Yeah. There's so much to tell.
I want you to know...
...that I will always be there
for you.
I will always be there
to take care of you.
I promise you that.
I will always be your friend.
Only a friend...
...Peter Parker?
That's all I have to give.
Whatever life holds in store for me...
I will never forget these words,
"With great power
comes great responsibility. "
This is my gift.
My curse.
Who am I?
I'm Spiderman.

She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.
Parker. Parker!
No, no, no, stop! Stop!
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep- dish pizzas.
I told you,
I don't understand that language.
- Speak English.
- You can't make pizza.
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.
- Why didn't you send Saleem?
- Saleem was deported yesterday.
- Look... Smiley.
- What about my cheese pizza?
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7,5 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
Hey, what, are you stupid?
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.
Yes, Mr. Spider- Man.
See you.
Way to go, Spidey!
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
Elevator.
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.
You're fired.
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
- Boss.
- Not now.
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho
Spider- Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take
any more pictures.
You turned the whole city
against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
- It's your wife, she lost her chequebook.
- Thanks for the good news.
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.
All right, Mr. Jameson.
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."
I told you, he's not a menace.
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.
That's outrageous.
Done. Give this to the girl.
Thank you. Bye- bye.
Hi.
Hey, Pete.
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.
- Right.
- Sorry.
Hey.
Chin up, okay?
Watch it, jerk!
Dr. Connors. Sorry.
Where were you headed, Parker?
To your class.
My class is over.
See me standing here?
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.
Then be here.
Look at you, Peter.
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.
You always appear exhausted.
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.
Planning is not a major
at this university.
Octavius is a friend of mine.
Better do your research, Parker.
Get it done, or I'm failing you.
Surprise!
Well, say something.
What's the occasion?
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!
Whether you want
to remember it or not.
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Long time, no see.
So how's the play?
I read a great review.
It's going fine. It's going good.
She's brilliant in it.
Harry sent me roses.
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider- Man?
How's the bug these days?
The less you see of that man,
the better.
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.
Thank you.
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.
M.J., could you give me a hand?
She's waiting for you, pal.
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
Why, are you dead?
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
Could we get off that subject?
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?
Peter, don't you understand
how I feel?
I want this guy dead.
The same way you want the guy
who killed your Uncle Ben dead.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
rag on you on your birthday.
You're my buddy, you know that.
You're family, Pete.
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.
Thank you, Harry.
May.
Oh, what, Ben?
Wait.
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.
Everybody's gone, aren't they?
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
Oh, my. You did?
Oh, well.
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!
You can take this money from me.
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!
And don't you dare leave it here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?
I think to myself at times...
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.
Now...
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey. You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.
The photographer liked my face.
I was only supposed to be
in the catalogue.
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.
Your dream came true.
How about yours?
I'm fine.
I wish you'd come see the play.
You're the one who
always encouraged me.
I plan to.
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.
Oh, boy, yeah.
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was...
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
What?
Happy birthday.
I'm seeing somebody now.
- Therapy.
- No.
A person, a man.
You mean, like a boyfriend?
Well, like I like him.
What?
Nothing.
That's good, you know?
Companionship...
May be more than that.
More?
I don't know.
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.
Don't disappoint me.
I won't.
Rent.
- Hi.
- Hi. What's " hi"?
Can I spend it?
I have a paycheque due this week
and...
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.
Hello?
Rent?
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.
It's not about the prizes, Harry.
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.
Who do we have here?
This is my good friend
I called you about.
He got me through
high-school science.
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...
I know what you're doing here...
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!
Interesting fellow, your friend.
I won't take much of your time.
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.
He also tells me you're lazy.
I'm trying to do better.
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.
And you use it
for the good of mankind.
Otto, your lunch is ready.
- This is my wife, Rosie.
- Hello.
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.
I always fell asleep in physics class.
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- Good to meet you.
Excuse me.
Is that it?
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.
Sympathetic frequencies.
Harmonic reinforcement?
Go on.
An exponential increase
in energy output.
A huge amount of energy.
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.
It's all so amazing. If it works,
it could change the way we live.
It is amazing, and it will work.
Are you sure you could stabilise
the fusion reaction?
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?
This is my life's work.
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.
You can sleep soundly tonight.
Otto's done his homework.
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?
Rosie, I love this boy.
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well...
I don't really know.
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.
Love should never be a secret.
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...
...gonna make you sick.
I finally got lucky in love.
We both did.
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.
Time present and time past
- Are both perhaps present
- Perhaps present
- In time future
- In time future
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.
Poetry.
Never fails.
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie
Brightest green were all her garments
And her hair was lik e the sunshine
Day by day he gazed upon her
Rent!
Where is my money?!
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
Work out, plenty of rest.
You know, eat your green vegetables.
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on. Go.
Keep it steady.
It's a web.
Go, Spidey, go!
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should
forgive them?
Yes.
I mean, no.
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.
It helps maintain the illusion.
I understand.
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.
But not to come late.
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...
Listen, can't you...?
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man
A-does whatever a spider can
A-spins a web, any size
Catches thieves a-just lik e flies
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?
Yeah, I'm sure.
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?
What are you doing here?
You hungry?
Starved.
What was that?
Okay.
How you doing?
Good.
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.
- Think it's great.
- Thanks.
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols & Knudsen...
...PR firm in the building...
...and I just wanna say I think
the image you have is fantastic.
It's really put together.
The costume. The... this thing.
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.
I think you could do more
than print though.
I think you might wanna try some TV,
you know?
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?
How about a children's book?
You could...
Like Charlotte's Web,
but without the pig. That kind of thing.
How about a line of hammocks?
Because it's kind of a web thing.
You could do a men's cologne
called Thwip.
Let me give you a card.
I don't have any pockets.
Yeah.
Well, we're right in the building.
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.
- Slow elevator.
- Yeah.
Thus, the second-order term...
...in the expansion of
the exact order...
...is identical to the second order...
...calculated from first-order
perturbation energy.
Since we are free to choose
an arbitrary origin for our energy...
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.
Hi, M.J..
This is Peter.
I was on my way to your show and...
Well, I was on my bike...
Are you there?
I really was planning on it all day.
And...
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.
Bingo.
It's amazing, isn't it?
How complicated a simple thing...
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.
Your time has expired.
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.
I wanna tell you the truth.
Here it is.
I'm Spider- Man.
Weird, huh?
Now you know
why I can't be with you.
If my enemies found out about you...
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.
But first, before we start...
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?
Because we found the rubber band.
It's a terrible joke.
But thank you for coming.
Today...
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.
And now let me introduce
my assistants.
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...
...is as advanced as you suggest...
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?
How right you are.
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...
...to protect
my higher brain function.
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.
And now on to the main event.
Give me the blue light, Rosie.
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...fasten your seat belts.
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.
Thank you.
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.
The power of the sun...
...in the palm of my hand.
Keep calm! It's only a spike!
It'll soon stabilise!
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.
We have a containment breach!
Otto, please get back!
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!
It will stabilise! It's under control!
I'm in charge here!
It's my money! I'm in con...
This doesn't change anything.
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.
No!
Rosie!
Watch it.
That was too close.
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.
I'm ruined.
I have nothing left,
except Spider- Man.
He saved your life, sir.
He humiliated me by touching me.
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.
What was he doing here anyway?
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.
We're ready, doctor.
Anybody here take shop class?
No! No! No!
Help me! Help me!
No!
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumours.
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?
Hoffman!
What are we gonna call this guy?
- "Dr. Octopus".
- That's crap.
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!
- "Dr. Strange".
- That's pretty good.
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus".
- I like it.
- Of course you do.
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
" Doc Ock".
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?
Get out.
Chief, I found Parker.
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!
I heard Spider- Man was there.
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.
Chief, the planetarium party.
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.
What do you know
about high society?
- Oh. Well, I...
- Don't answer that.
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.
Could you pay me in advance?
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.
My Rosie's dead.
My dream is dead.
And these...
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...
...along with me.
Something...
...in my head.
Something talking.
The inhibitor chip!
Gone.
Rebuild.
No.
Peter was right.
I miscalculated.
I couldn't have miscalculated.
It was working, wasn't it?
Yes.
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.
But we need money.
Steal it?
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.
That's right.
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.
We'll do it here.
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.
Nothing will stand in our way.
Nothing!
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.
My uncle Ben's life insurance.
Yes, but I'm afraid...
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.
You are?
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...
...a new supersaver account
with us today.
But the fact is...
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.
Well...
At least we get the toaster.
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.
Oh, yes, I see.
Okay.
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
Peter?
Don't leave me.
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.
Hold it!
Put your arms up! All of them!
Here's your change!
Oh, no. Come on!
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.
Not anymore.
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.
Wait a second.
- Hand her over.
- Of course.
Easy, now.
Butterfingers.
Look out!
Help me!
- Help me!
- I'm coming!
Hang on!
Help!
Thank you.
Aunt May.
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.
Come on.
Shame on you.
There you go.
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.
We sure showed him.
What do you mean, "we"?
- Take me with you, Spider- Man.
- Take me.
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Penny! Over here!
Leave it.
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.
Why? It's a party.
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?
Not to mention your friend the bug.
Not tonight, Harry.
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.
Parker!
Parker!
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.
Beautiful tie.
Get a shot of us with the DA.
Beautiful dress.
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.
Wife.
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...
...is pleased to present
our guest of honour.
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...
...Captain John Jameson.
Hi.
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.
But there was a disturbance.
I don't know you.
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.
I've been reading poetry lately.
Whatever that means.
Day by day he gazed upon her
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...
Don't start.
Can I get you a drink?
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.
John.
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.
Even my father.
He came backstage to borrow cash.
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.
After all these years...
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider- Man and not to your best friend.
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.
Don't act like you're my friend.
You stole M.J. from me.
You stole my father's love.
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?
Huh? Isn't that right?
Huh, brother?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.
What a surprise.
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!
Oh, no. No!
Why is this happening to me?
You told him yes? Just that fast?
It felt right.
Well, you might congratulate me.
Congratulations.
Good luck in the world.
John loves me.
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.
No man will ever want you."
So, what, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...
...trying to prove something
to your father?
Do you really love this guy?
- Very much.
- "Very much"?
That just doesn't fly.
I mean, if you really love the guy,
then the answer is:
"Do I love him? I adore him.
He's my comfortable afghan.
He's all I can think about.
Everything he is, everything he says,
everything he does...
...to me, for me, with me,
is sweet kisses.
He makes up for all the grief
and pain I've ever had...
...and in the dark of the night,
he is there."
That's the answer I need.
Not just "I love him very much".
You read too many love stories.
What about that perfect kiss
you said you had once?
- The guy you believed in?
- That was a fantasy.
That's all he is.
But what's wrong with believing
in love stories?
You seem very okay to me.
My diagnosis?
It's up here.
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?
There is one dream where...
...in my dream...
...I'm Spider- Man.
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.
So you're Spider- Man.
In my dream.
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.
So it's somebody else's dream.
- What's your major? Theatre Arts?
- Science.
Connors?
He flunking you?
He says he might.
There you go.
What about this friend?
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.
I've been there. Who was I?
Identity. Big one.
Me, I go to my shrink.
What does he tell you?
She tells me I need some
strong focus on what I want.
And I have to find out
who won't let me have it, why...
...and then I have to tackle that guy,
let him hear me...
And one more thing. I have to
make sure I'm right about what I want.
Listen...
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider- Man climbing those walls.
That's why you keep falling.
You always have a choice, Peter.
I have a choice.
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...
...make me sad.
Can't you understand?
I'm in love with Mary Jane.
You know I understand.
But I thought you'd learned
the meaning of responsibility.
Oh, you don't know how it feels.
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...
...fairness, justice...
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...
...to take those dreams
out into the world.
I can't live your dreams anymore.
I want a life of my own.
You've been given a gift, Peter.
With great power
comes great responsibility.
Take my hand, son.
No, Uncle Ben.
I'm just Peter Parker.
I'm Spider-Man...
...no more.
No more.
No more.
- You punk!
- Sorry.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Hurry up!
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are?
Someone, please?
.23 electron volts.
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...
...in a very inexcusable manner.
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.
That would be hypocrisy.
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.
" I am glad."
" I am glad."
" I am glad."
Are you glad to hear it?
I am glad...
...to hear it.
In fact, now you mention
the subject...
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.
You could've told me
you were coming.
I was afraid you'd say,
" Don't come."
You look different.
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.
I do my homework now.
You wanna get some chow mein?
Peter...
...l'm getting married.
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.
And who's the groom?
You hadn't decided yet.
You think just because
you saw my play...
...you can talk me out
of getting married?
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.
You're too late.
Will you think about it?
Think about what?
Picking up where we left off.
Where was that?
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.
I don't think it's that simple.
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.
You don't understand.
I'm not an empty seat anymore.
I'm different.
Punch me, I bleed.
I have to go.
I'm getting married in a church.
You are different.
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.
Where the hell did you get that?
In the garbage.
In the garbage?
He must've given up.
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.
Your wife is still on that line.
Flowers? How much?
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.
Get plastic.
Gotta go, big story.
Spider-Man
Spider-Man
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?
Come on, man. Get the money.
Come on, come on.
Help!
Come on!
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.
He was a peaceful man.
And it was all my doing.
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.
Oh, I know I shouldn't.
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...
...and he wanted to drive you.
If only I had stopped him.
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.
I'm responsible.
For what?
For what happened to Uncle Ben.
But you were at the library.
You were doing your homework.
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.
What do you mean?
I went someplace else.
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...
...to buy a car, because I wanted...
...to impress Mary Jane.
It happened so fast.
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.
The thief...
...was running towards me.
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...
...revenge.
I let him go.
I let him get away.
He wanted a car.
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.
Uncle Ben said no...
...and then he shot him.
Uncle Ben was killed that night...
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.
And I...
I held his hand...
...when he died.
I've tried to tell you so many times.
Just one more little chore.
Where are you?
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.
Your father only obsessed
over his work.
Good night, Bernard.
Hello, Harry.
Otto. What do you want?
That precious tritium.
But I need more of it this time.
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!
Hey! Hey!
Stop! Stop! All right!
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.
Kill Spider- Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.
How do I find him?
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?
He takes pictures of Spider- Man
for the Bugle.
Make him tell you where he is.
Have it ready.
Don't hurt Peter!
Somebody, help!
Fire!
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.
Hey, where you going?!
I'm coming!
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Come on. Come on.
Mama.
You got some guts, kid.
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.
Oh, man.
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?
What I need?
What am I supposed to do?
I shouldn't have without...
...knocking.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?
Okay.
And a glass of milk?
That would be nice.
Okay.
Thank you.
You got a message.
It's your aunt.
Thanks.
What's going on?
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...
...and I'm giving him $5.
That's Henry Jackson?
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.
Nine years old, has great ambitions.
Listen, about my last visit...
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.
And I'm proud of you.
And I thank you, and I...
I love you, Peter.
So very, very much.
Hey. Where are all my comic books?
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.
You're getting tall.
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.
Okay. You take
Spider- Man's pictures, right?
I used to.
Where is he?
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.
He...
...quit.
- Why?
Wanted to try other things.
He'll be back, right?
I don't know.
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.
Spider- Man.
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...
...saving old girls like me.
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...
...setting examples for all of us.
Everybody loves a hero.
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...
...just to get a glimpse of the one...
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.
I believe there's a hero in all of us...
...that keeps us honest...
...gives us strength...
...makes us noble...
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...
...and give up the thing
we want the most.
Even our dreams.
Spider- Man did that for Henry...
...and he wonders where he's gone.
He needs him.
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?
But don't strain yourself.
Okay.
Strong focus on what I want.
I'm back!
I'm back!
My back.
My back.
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?
Peter Parker?
Positive.
Thought he was your pal.
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.
He's just a great big jerk.
The world's full of great big jerks.
You're adorable.
It's just the uniform.
Lean your head back for me.
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.
Just put my head back?
Okay.
Wow.
I'm back on the moon.
You up there with me?
- Hiya.
- Surprised?
Very.
Thanks for coming.
Everything okay?
You might say so.
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.
I was afraid to trust you.
But I've been thinking about it...
Listen, there's more for me to say.
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?
I'm saying...
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...
...but I can't.
My mind was playing tricks too.
Do you love me, or not?
I...
...don't.
You don't.
Kiss me.
Kiss you?
I need to know something.
Just one kiss.
What's happening?
Peter Parker...
...and the girlfriend.
What do you want?
I want you to find your friend
Spider- Man.
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.
I don't know where he is.
Find him.
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.
If you lay one finger on her...
You'll do what?
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiance.
Sorry, Jonah.
It's all my fault.
I drove Spider- Man away.
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.
Yes.
Spider- Man was a hero.
I just couldn't see it.
He was a...
A thief! A criminal!
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!
I want him strung up by his web!
I want Spider- Man!
Where is she?
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.
What the hell?
You have a train to catch.
Help!
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!
- It's Spider- Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!
Tell everyone to hang on!
Brace yourselves!
Any more bright ideas?
I got a few, yeah!
Whoa, watch out!
We're slowing down.
Nice and easy, we'll go down.
Slower. Gently.
Is he alive?
He's...
...just a kid.
No older than my son.
It's all right.
We found something.
We won't tell nobody.
It's good to have you back,
Spider- Man.
He's mine!
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.
And me.
Me too.
Very well.
Where do you want him?
And the tritium?
Yes.
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.
First we'll see who's behind the mask.
I can look into your eyes as you die.
Pete.
No.
It can't be.
Harry.
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.
Tritium?
He's making the machine again.
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...
...you killed my father.
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.
Hey!
Hey!
I'm talking to you!
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider- Man's dead.
He's not dead.
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.
Surprise.
As soon as you get free...
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.
Well, I'm not.
Hang on, Mary Jane!
Run!
Let's see you scurry out of this.
Now what?
Dr. Octavius.
We have to shut it down.
Please tell me how.
Peter Parker?
" Brilliant but lazy."
Look at what's happening.
We must destroy it.
I can't destroy it.
I won't.
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.
A privilege.
These things have turned you
into something you're not.
Don't listen to them.
It was my dream.
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...
...and give up the thing
we want the most.
Even our dreams.
You're right.
He's right.
Listen.
Listen to me now.
Listen to me now.
Now, tell me how to stop it.
It can't be stopped.
It's self-sustaining now.
- Think!
- Unless...
The river.
Drown it.
I'll do it.
No!
Hi.
Hi.
This is really heavy.
M.J.
In case we die...
You do love me.
I do.
Even though you said you didn't.
I will not die a monster.
I think I always knew...
...all this time...
...who you really were.
Then you know
why we can't be together.
Spider- Man will always have enemies.
I can't let you take that risk.
I will...
...always be Spider- Man.
You and I can never be.
Mary Jane!
Hello?
Who's that?
Son.
I'm here.
Dad?
- I thought you were...
- No.
I'm alive in you, Harry.
Now it's your turn.
You swore to make Spider- Man pay.
Now make him pay.
But Pete's my best friend.
And I'm your father.
You're weak.
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.
Now you know the truth about Peter.
Be strong, Harry.
Avenge me.
- Avenge me!
- No!
Call Deborah.
The caterer?
Tell her not to open the caviar.
Had to do what I had to do.
Mary Jane.
Peter.
I can't survive without you.
You shouldn't be here.
I know you think we can't be together.
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?
I know there'll be risks.
But I want to face them with you.
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...
...half of ourselves.
I love you.
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.
I've always been
standing in your doorway.
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?
Well, say something.
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.
Go get them, tiger.

I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.
You're here because I need you.
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?
No. This one's special.
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?
Yeah, the brochure is great.
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?
- Illness?
- John.
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.
Of course.
Jean, can you come down, dear?
We'll leave you, then.
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.
Really? I doubt that.
Oh, Charles.
I like this one.
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.
The question is, will you control that power?
Or let it control you?
Warren? Son, is everything all right?
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.
Open the door. Warren.
One second!
Open this door.
Warren.
Let me in there right now. Open the door.
Oh, God.
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.
Bobby!
Thanks, Kitty.
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.
That was my last cigar.
Logan.
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.
Class dismissed.
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.
Simulation complete.
- What was that?
- Danger room session.
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.
- Scott!
- Jean.
Scott. Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.
No, you didn't. The professor did.
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.
Hey, look.
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.
Maybe it's time for us to move on.
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.
Mr. President.
Have a seat, Hank.
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.
Yes, sir. She can do that.
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.
Where is Magneto?
Raven?
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?
In here with us.
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.
You don't want to play games with me?
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?
You wanna know where he is?
Homo sapien.
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.
It's what she stole from the FDA.
Dear Lord.
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.
When an individual acquires great power,
the use or misuse of that power is everything.
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.
Why? Because we are mutants.
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern
without any superhuman authority behind it.
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,
say a father of four with terminal cancer,
into the body of this man?
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...
Professor?
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.
The forecast was for sunny skies.
I'm sorry.
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.
Yes, but we can't be students forever.
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.
He took Jean's death so hard.
Yes, things are better out there,
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.
There's something you're not telling us.
Hank?
Ororo. Charles.
I love what you've done with your hair.
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.
- Suppress?
- Permanently.
They're calling it a cure.
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?
Storm.
They're announcing it now.
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I proudly present the answer to mutation.
Finally, we have a cure.
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?
Not all of us can fit in so easily.
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.
No. Professor.
They can't cure us.
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.
Or any of us, for that matter.
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.
Nobody is talking about extermination.
No one ever talks about it.
They just do it.
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,
the extermination has already begun.
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.
They will force their cure upon us.
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?
Who will you stand with? The humans?
Or us?
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.
Back off.
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.
You know who you're talking to?
Do you?
And what can you do?
So you have talents?
That and more. I know you control metal.
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.
Other than you two.
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?
Could you locate one for me?
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.
Oh, Mr. President.
Shut up.
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.
Please.
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.
Yeah, right.
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.
And his power? What is its range?
You'll see.
Jimmy.
There's someone I would like you to meet.
Hello there, son.
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.
Extraordinary, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.
Stop!
Jean?
Scott.
How?
I don't know.
I wanna see your eyes.
- Take these off.
- No.
No.
Trust me. I can control it now.
Open them. You can't hurt me.
- What happened?
- No clue.
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?
I can't see a damn thing.
I can take care of that.
What the...
Logan!
She's alive.
Jean.
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.
The only explanation of Jean's survival
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.
Is she gonna be OK?
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.
What have you done to her?
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.
History will be made here today.
For the first time,
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.
Good. Bring him in.
Are you sure you want to start with him?
I think it's important. Yes.
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.
You ready?
The transformation can be a little jarring.
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.
It'll all be over soon.
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.
Warren, calm down.
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.
Warren, it's a better life.
- It's what we all want.
- No.
It's what you want.
Warren, no!
Told you so.
About time.
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.
Without him, they have nothing.
Read off the guest list.
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."
This one robbed seven banks.
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."
How fascinating.
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.
No!
You saved me.
Eric.
I'm sorry, my dear.
You're not one of us any more.
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?
I have.
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.
As do I.
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.
Jean.
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
More than OK.
Logan, you're making me blush.
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.
It's OK.
It's OK.
- Wait.
- No.
Jean.
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.
The professor said you might be different.
He would know, wouldn't he?
What? You think he's not in your head too?
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.
Where's Scott?
Jean?
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.
Jean, tell me what happened to him.
Oh, God.
Look at me.
Stay with me. Talk to me.
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.
Focus. Focus, Jean.
Kill me.
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.
- Don't say that.
- Please.
- Stop it.
- Kill me.
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.
It'll be all right. We can help you.
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.
I don't want to fix it.
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.
I told you they would draw first blood.
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.
Come. We have an army to build.
I picked something up.
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.
It's a mutant.
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.
More powerful than you.
Where is she?
Logan.
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?
What have you done?
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.
It may be too late.
- Wait for me here.
- What?
I need to see Jean alone.
You were right, Charles.
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.
So, shall we go inside?
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.
Funny, you sound just like her parents.
Nobody gets inside.
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.
- So you want to control me?
- He does.
No. I want to help you.
Help me? What's wrong with me?
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.
For your own good, Jean.
Stay out of my head.
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.
Get out of my head.
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.
No! Stop it!
That's it.
Jean, let me in.
No, Jean.
Jean!
Don't let it control you.
Charles.
My dear. Come with me.
No.
God!
We live in an age of darkness.
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.
A world he tried to heal.
A mission he never saw accomplished.
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.
And that's a vision of a world united.
Kitty.
Bobby.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
It's just... Xavier came to my house.
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.
Yeah, me too.
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.
You have Rogue and I have...
You know, I just miss home.
The first snow and all that.
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.
Don't worry. We won't get caught.
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.
Come on.
This place can be home too.
Thank you for this, Bobby.
You need a lift, kid?
No.
Where are you going?
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.
Yeah, I do.
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.
A hug. A handshake.
A kiss.
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.
Look, if you wanna go, then go.
Just be sure it's what you want.
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?
To go upstairs and unpack?
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.
Just think about what I said, Rogue.
Marie.
Marie.
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"
I can manipulate the metal in this,
but you, you can do anything.
Anything you can think of.
Jean.
Enough.
Enough.
You sound just like him.
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.
As nature intended.
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.
And that fight begins now.
She shouldn't be here with us.
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.
So what now? What do we do?
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.
It was, son.
And it still is. We'll find you a room.
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.
Rogue.
Hey, Rogue.
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.
Logan.
Logan.
- Logan.
- Jean?
Logan. Where am I? Logan.
Logan. Logan.
- Logan.
- Stop.
Logan. Logan. Logan.
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.
She killed the professor.
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.
Listen, why can't you see the truth?
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...
Because you love her.
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.
So if you're with us, then be with us.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?
I'm looking for someone.
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.
Come on, Iceman.
Make a move.
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.
Today's attack was only our first salvo.
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...
Join us or stay out of our way.
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.
Let's go. Keep it moving.
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.
Absolutely no metal.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.
They have their weapons.
We have ours.
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,
take control of the cure,
and destroy its source.
And then nothing can stop us.
Jean.
I know the smell of your domatium
from a mile away.
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.
And you stood there and let him die?
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.
OK.
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
Approaching target dead ahead.
Set for 360-degree incursion.
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.
OK, send them in.
OK.
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!
OK. I give up.
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.
Leave that to me.
Storm. Storm.
What are you doing back here?
I need help.
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.
Let's suit up.
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.
Yeah. We're outnumbered.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
But we lost Scott.
We lost the professor.
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Are you?
Then we stand together.
X-Men.
All of us.
We're in.
Let's go.
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?
Dad, what's going on?
It's an earthquake.
We're trapped.
Charles always wanted to build bridges.
My God.
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!
In chess, the pawns go first.
Humans and their guns.
Plastic. They've learned.
That's why the pawns go first.
Target the bridge.
Fire!
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.
Then God help us.
They're coming for him.
Don't ever do that again.
You men cover the doors!
Everybody get together! And hold this line!
Traitors to their own cause.
Finish them!
Not yet.
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.
With pleasure.
Hold it!
He's going for the boy!
Not if I get there first.
Kitty!
Come on.
Grow those back.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.
Going somewhere?
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?
Yes, I am.
Girls.
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.
Calm down. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be OK.
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."
Oh, you get the point.
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.
No.
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.
This way.
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.
Who's hiding, dickhead?
Don't. No.
Don't.
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.
Do we look like we need your help?
It's time to end this war.
Take cover.
Get out of the way.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.
Go! Go! Go!
We work as a team.
Best defense is a good offence.
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?
Go ahead.
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.
Right.
You're in over your head, Bobby.
Maybe you should go back to school.
You never should have left.
This is it.
Hey.
Make it a strike.
You never learn, do you?
Actually, I do.
I'm...
One of them?
This is what they want for all of us.
It's over, Jean.
It's over.
No! Don't shoot!
No!
Everybody get out of there!
Bobby!
What have I done?
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.
Go.
Jean!
Jean!
I know you're still there!
You would die for them?
No, not for them.
For you.
For you.
Save me.
I love you.
You're back.
I'm sorry.
I had to.
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.
It's what I want.
Hey.
Good to see you, buddy.
With the thanks of a grateful nation
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,
human and mutant alike,
Dr. Hank McCoy.
Way to go, fur ball.
Morning.
Hello, Moira.
Charles.

It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood... you know.
I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider.
Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me.
Now...
- Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!
people really like me.
Hey, stick around! It's gonna start again in a couple minutes.
- Yeah... - That's OK.
The city is safe and sound.
Guess I've had something to do with that.
My uncle Ben would be proud.
I still go to school,
top of my class.
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us
that the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field.
From the form of this matrix,
we can see...?
Miss Stacey?
- That only the m=0 quantum states are affected.
Correct! Good work, Miss Stacey.
Parker.
You got something to add?
No, sir.
And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.
Hi. Um, Miss Watson left a ticket for me?
Peter Parker.
Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you.
It's my girlfriend!
Harry!
I need to talk to you.
Explain things.
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.
MJ.
Peter.
Was I good?
- Good?
You were great. You were...
- You say great?
I love my flowers. They're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.
Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.
What's with you guys anyway?
It's complicated.
Tell me again, was I really good?
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.
Your knees were fine.
- The applause was not very loud.
Yes, it was.
It's the acoustics.
It's all about diffusion.
It keeps the sound waves from grouping.
You see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it's like an...
- You are such a nerd.
Did you see that one?
You know what?
I'd like to sing on stage for the rest of my life
with you in the first row.
I'll be there.
Tell me you love me.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I always have.
You can't hide here, Flint.
I'm just here to see my daughter.
You are an escaped convict.
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.
You're nothing but a common thief.
You maybe even killed a man.
It wasn't even like that.
Wasn't.
I had good reason for what I was doing.
And that's the truth.
You and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together.
I live in a prison. It's a great truth.
And that is the truth that you left behind.
Right there in that bedrooom.
I missed you.
I missed you too, Daddy.
I promise
I'll make you healthy again.
Whatever it takes.
I'll get the money.
- You get out of here.
Now.
I'm not a bad person.
Just had bad luck.
Peter, what is it?
It's MJ...
I'm gonna ask her to marry me!
Oh, Peter! Oh!
The day that uncle Ben asked me to marry him,
he was so scared and excited.
And very young.
And I loved him so fiercely.
Then you said yes, right?
No. I wanted to say yes, but I said no.
I wasn't ready,
neither was he.
So we took our time.
Looked forward to it.
Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love.
A man has to be understanding
and put his wife before himself.
Can you do that, Peter?
Yeah. I think I can.
Then you have my blessing.
I hope you've considered a proper proposal.
Your uncle had it all planned.
He took me to the beach one Sunday.
He was a knockout in his bathing suit.
And I, I didn't look too bad myself.
We were very good swimmers.
It was a beautiful day,
and he said: "Let's swim to the island."
And at the island,
we found a perfect spot by an old tree,
and we lay down and looked up at the sky.
And then he said, "Close your eyes, May."
And I did. And then he said, "Open them."
And I did.
And he was holding this ring.
Dazzling, in front of me.
I thought it was the sun.
We'd be married 50 years
come August... if...
So.
I hope you make it very special
for Mary Jane.
Do something she'll never forget.
Give her this.
Come on.
Take it.
Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.
Listen to me! I didn't kill your father!
He was trying to kill me. He killed himself.
Shut up!
I'm still here, Peter!
Hate those things.
Harry.
Harry.
Harry!
Oh my God.
Harry!
Come on!
God!
- And clear!
No response.
- Recharge. Let's go again.
Clear!
No response.
We charge it one more time. And clear!
Captain Stacey.
What's this?
- Flint Marko, the guy we tied to the Ben Paker homicide.
What about him?
- He just broke out of Rikers.
And?
- He's on the run.
He's in the marshlands. I think we got him.
There he is!
"DANGER
PARTICLE PHYSICS TEST FACILITY
KEEP OUT"
Euton, take the west side. Tommy, take the east.
Where'd he go?
That's it. It's charged.
- Right.
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on 1.
There's a change in the silicon mass.
It's probably a bird. It'll fly away when we fire it up.
Initiating demoleculisation.
How is he?
- He's gonna be OK.
But there's been some memory impairment.
Particularly his short-term memory.
Right now, he can't remember the accident
or anything that happened to him recently.
Is it permanent?
It could be.
Only time will tell.
He's awake if you want to see him.
Uh-- maybe I should wait.
Nah, it's fine. Just keep it brief. Allow him to rest.
Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Hit my head.
Yeah.
Doctor said I was in an accident. Hit and run.
I don't remember much of anything.
My father--
he died, right?
This is all so weird.
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.
I know that face.
How are you doing?
I don't know.
Last thing I remember, I was falling...
somewhere.
You're still fine.
We love you, Harry.
It feels like
somehow I've been gone for a really long time.
Now I'm back home.
It's good to have you back.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to scoot, OK?
OK.
- All right, thank you.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, great.
I think he's gonna be fine.
Think so.
And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.
You have lovely friends.
My best friends.
I'd give my life for them.
Yeah?
- It's me.
- Oh! Hey!
You know I can't open the door.
It's stuck again?
Come on and help me.
I'm coming.
The review.
- Oh!
The hated it. They hated me.
Well, they can't hate you.
"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl.
"Easy on the eyes, but not on the ears.
"Her small voice didn't carry past the first row."
That's ridiculous. I was right there.
You were in the first row.
Yeah, but that's...
Listen. You were great.
That's a critic.
This is something you're gonna have to get used to.
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.
- This isn't about you.
It's about me.
It's about my career.
- I know, and I'm just saying,
you can't let it bring you down.
You just gotta believe in yourself.
You pull yourself together,
and you get right back on the horse.
- Don't give me the horse thing.
Try to understand how I feel.
It's just...
I look at these words,
and it's like my father wrote them.
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of 54th and 6th Ave, please report. Crane out of control. Approach with caution.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Sorry.
Oh my God.
Seven Atom to central. That crane .
It's bigger than we thought. We're gonna need a major mobilization right away.
Just gotta douse the accelerator! Now!
OK, Gwen.
I've got a secret. It's my call for ya.
What is that thing doing in my background?
Captain Stacey, the guys look out of shot of it.
They can't shut down the crane.
Get Edison on the phone.
Have them kill the power of the whole block.
Are you all right?
It's coming back!
Oh my God. It's Gwen!
What?
What's she doing up there?
I don't know. I just saw her last night. She said she had a modeling gig.
Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir.
Eddie Brock, jr.
I work at the Daily Bugle.
And I'm dating your daughter.
You OK?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Hey, Spidey, hold on. Bugle needs a photo.
Thank God you're OK.
- Daddy!
Hey. I'm the new guy.
- New guy?
From now on, I'm gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle.
So-- smile! Are you smiling?
Where's the other guy?
- Peter Parker?
Yeah, um, look, between you and me--
The guy's kind of an amateur.
Have you noticed, his stuff makes you look a little... bloated.
Just a little chunky.
- OK...
Don't have to worry about that anymore, buddy.
Dazzeling.
Just a little something the boys in the ad department and I whipped up.
As you know, circulation of the Bugle has been pretty good.
Though not as good as the New York Times
or the Daily News
or the Post or several other smaller...
- Get on with it, moron!
What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr Jameson.
Your wife told me to tell you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...
Thank you.
So, I propose this campaign:
"DAILY BUGLE" -- that's obvious.
"IT'S HIP, IT'S NOW" -- I came up with that one.
"IT'S WOW" -- that's actually Eric's.
"AND HOW!" -- that's me again.
Time to take your pill.
Not that one.
Not that one.
Drink plenty of water.
Thank you.
Continue.
He's busy.
Oh, no, I'm just here to talk to you, babe.
(- What's that smell?)
That's a little something called
"Nice 'n' Easy".
What's on you?
- It's called "Go Away".
That is the dumbest idea you've ever had. You have had some daunting...
- Blood pressure.
Hey, where are you going?
Who are you?
- You hired him last week.
Freelance.
- I did? What's that smell?
Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.
Wow, I really like that shirt.
Here. It's a crane accident. Check out the light source.
He likes my shirt.
Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete. You better get in there.
A new guy. He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.
Uh. Thanks.
Parker! You're late! Maybe too late. Bruckner here beat ya to it.
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.
- I got you this.
But he got me this.
Wait. How'd you get that? I didn't see you.
- How'd you get that high?
Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
A flagpole?
Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.
It's better.
- Cheaper, too.
Congratulations, son. We'll use your shot and pay you 50 bucks.
Uh-- all right, JJ. I'm your man.
I know more about what makes a good picture
than any photographer in this town.
See, photography, it's not just about
-- no offense -- flagpoles. Whatever.
It's about lighting. Composition. Drama.
I want a staff job, sir.
I have a girl that I intend to marry, and--
I have this stupid little dream of-- working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time.
J. Jonah Jameson.
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?
- You fired him.
- Whatever.
Wait a minute. I know what makes a good picture,
and I've been here for a long time. If there's a staff job,
Mr Jameson, I think I deserve it.
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us for years.
He's done a great job.
You want a staff job, and you want a staff job.
Anybody care about what I want?
I do.
- Shut up. Get out.
I want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is.
He's a fake. He's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.
"Spider-Man with his hand in the cookie jar".
Whoever brings me that photo gets the job.
What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go!
I'm on it, boss.
You'll never get that shot.
We'll see.
You know,
I guess one person can make a difference.
'Nuff said.
Welcome home, Harry.
Thank God you're all right.
Thanks, Bernard.
Aperitif?
- Sure.
Got you a little homecoming present.
Wha-- It's your old ball!
- Yeah.
Thanks, buddy.
We were pretty good in the backyard, weren't we?
We were terrible. And we tried out for the varsity team.
Yeah, for the cheerleaders.
- Right.
Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
I don't know.
- You don't?
Hey Bernard, do I have any girlfriends?
- Not that I know of, sir.
That's a pretty cool pass, huh?
It's OK.
Looks like I'm not worrying for money.
No.
Well, I bet I can turn this little girlfriend thing around.
You know,
he always appreciated how you helped me through high school.
I just wish I could remember more about him.
He loved you.
That's the main thing.
Hey, let's watch the game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.
- OK.
Whoa, catch that!
Did you see that?
Still got the moves.
Yeah!
Why are you stopping?
What is she doing here?
Gary, you were supposed to call her agent.
Hi, honey.
We tried to reach you.
I'm sorry.
One critic?
- No, all the papers, dear.
Mary Jane, honey. Sit down. Let's explain it to you.
- If you like, we could say you became ill.
That was so poorly handled.
- Yeah. Let's just rehearse.
All right, Spidey!
Excuse me, miss. Let me see that gorgeous smile.
Hi, Eddie.
You're so beautiful.
This is front page stuff.
I've got to practice. I'll see you later, OK?
How about tonight?
- Not tonight.
Why not?
Think of that amazing-- night that we had.
We had a coffee, Eddie.
Hey, beautiful.
One more.
Everything OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
You're not still mad at me, are you?
No, Peter. I'm proud of you.
Hey. I'm gonna be swingin' it from over there.
So you know where to look.
Give 'em a good show.
Don't worry about that review.
We're gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night.
Promise.
- Yeah.
Isn't that that guy from that prison break?
He fits.
Hey you! Halt!
Cover the back!
Fire!
People of the city of New York, I am here today
because I fell 62 storeys
and someone caught me.
Someone who never asks for anything in return.
Someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is.
Hey, MJ.
- Harry.
Where is Pete?
Um-- taking somebody's picture, I guess.
I'm so happy to see you. You look so good.
I've never felt better.
It's a weird feeling, not knowing New York.
Bump on the head, I'm just free as a bird.
Will you bump me on the head?
- Bop.
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.
You came. You sent me flowers.
I did?
I'll come again tonight.
You can't.
I--I was let go.
What happened.
I wasn't very good.
You know, this is embarrassing, but...
I once wrote you a play in high school.
You wrote me a play?
Yeah.
- Harry, that's the sweetest thing.
I ask you: When you're dropping without a parachute
or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire,
who is it that brakes your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children?
Spider-Man!
They love me!
Then let's hear it! For your one and only friendly neighborhood...
Spider-Man!
Kiss him!
Kiss him!
Go ahead, lay it right on me.
Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.
Kiss him! Kiss him!
- No, Spider-Man, no!
Right...
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.
Hey, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Jig's up, pal.
I don't want to hurt you.
Leave now.
- I guess you haven't heard?
I'm the sheriff 'round these parts.
OK.
Where do all these guys come from?
Bonsoir. Le monsieur a-t-il un "reservation"?
I'm sorry, I don't speak...
- But this is a French restaurant, non?
Oui.
Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.
Ah. Here we are.
Table for two. Pekar.
Parker.
- That is what I said.
Pekar.
Um, I have a request.
My girlfriend will be coming,
and I have this ring.
Ah. All.
Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, hein?
Yes, and I want to do something very special.
I love it.
Romance.
I am French.
When I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring...
In ze bottom of her glass?
Perfect.
- Magnifique.
Also I thought, at the same time
could the musicians
play this song?
Their favorite.
And take good care of the ring.
Ah oui, with my life, monsieur.
- S'il vous plat.
- Oui.
I like you.
Thank you.
"Bon" chance.
Bonne chance.
OK, so... How would you like some champagne?
How'd that get in there?
Aw, don't cry.
Look at you, wow! Beautiful.
- Thanks.
Is this place in your budget?
Oh, it's a special occasion.
You're on Broadway.
I don't feel like much of a star tonight.
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.
Peter, you have no idea how I feel right now.
Oh no, I know exactly how you feel.
Listen.
I have been through this.
Happens to me all the time.
I see Spider-Man posters in the window.
Kids running around with me on their sweaters.
Big Hallowe'en item.
I don't know, I guess I've become something of an icon.
Like yesterday.
They keep screaming: "Spider-Man! Spider-Man!"
I don't know, I mean,
I'm thinking to myself,
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?"
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
Hi. My parents and I are just having dinner here.
Hello.
I'm Gwen Stacey.
This is Mary Jane Watson.
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time.
Gwen is my lab partner in Dr Connor's class.
Pete's something of a genius. I'd be completely lost without him.
Which actually reminds me--
Pete, if you got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man,
could you bring it to class?
I'd really love it.
For my portfolio.
After all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?
I can't imagine.
Well, it was lovely to meet you.
Good night.
- Good night.
Uh, she's in my science class. It's not her best subject.
What?
How come you never mentioned her?
She's your lab partner,
you saved her life,
she thinks you're a genius and she had her polished fingernails all over you?
Or didn't you notice?
And she gave Spider-Man the key to the city.
I'll never forget that.
She's just a girl in my class.
- Let me ask you something.
When you kissed her,
who was kissing her?
Spider-Man or Peter?
What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.
That was our kiss.
Why would you do that?
You must have known how it made me feel.
Do you want to push me away?
Push you away?
Why would I want to push you away? I love you.
You're my girlfriend. She's a girl in my class, MJ.
I don't feel very well. I'm sorry. I have to go.
Where are you going?
- Please don't follow me.
Here we are.
Hi, it's MJ. Sing a song at the beep. Beep!
Hello. Uh...
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on.
I don't know if you got the messages, or what.
But...
I just want to talk to you.
OK. Call me, all right?
Hallo?
- Mr Parker?
Yeah?
- This is Detective Neil Garettfrom the 2nd precinct.
I'm calling on behalf of Captain Stacey.
He would like you to come down to the station to speak with him.
Originally we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine,
was your husband's killer.
We were wrong.
What?
- Turns out Mr Carradine was only an accomplice.
The actual killer is still at large.
What are you talking about?
This is the man who killed your husband.
His name is Flint Marko.
He's a small-time crook who's been in and out of prison.
You got this wrong.
Two days ago, he escaped.
Evidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate.
And we have a couple of witnesses who corroborate the story.
No, wait, sir. You don't want to do this.
Get in! What are you doing?
Would you put these photos away, please?
I'm sorry, Mrs Parker. I know this isn't easy,
but please be patient with us.
We're doing our job. We will catch him.
No, you're not doing your job.
I watched my uncle die.
We chased down the wrong man.
Now you're telling me there's suspicions for two years? Witnesses?
Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down, sir.
No, I have no intention of settling down!
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!
L-20 Parkway, all officers in the vicinity please report.
We have an abandoned vehicle and an abandoned man in the middle of the street.
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.
Peter, it's MJ.
I'm not here about what happened at dinner. Just please open up.
Aunt May called me. She told me about what happened.
She's worried about you.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be. I'm fine.
I don't want you to do something stupid.
Like try to find my uncle's killer?
And do something you'll regret.
Like...
with that other guy.
He had a gun on me.
I made a move, and he fell. I told you that.
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
C-22, auto at 566, 9th Avenue...
- Will you turn that thing off?
Peter, I'm here because I care about you.
And I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty, but--
I want to be here for you.
- OK.
I get it. Thank you.
But, uh, I'm fine.
I don't need your help.
Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter.
Even Spider-Man.

Don't hurt me! Just give me a chance!
- What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?
Did you?
Where am I?
What is this?
I feel...
Wow.
This feels good.
This is something else.
What do you think?
I've never seen anything like it.
I'm a physicist, not a biologist, but...
I'll look at it in the morning, run some tests.
- Can we do that now?
It seems to like you.
Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?
It has the characteristics of a symbiote,
which needs to bond to a host to survive.
And sometimes, these things in nature, when they bind,
they can be hard to unbind.

Another sand storm is reported in the vicinity. All cars, proceed with caution.
Marko.
Buddy, love the new outfit.
This is exactly what I need to scoop, partner. Give me some of that web action.
See you, chum.
What the hell?
Flint Marko?
What do you want from me?
Remember Ben Parker?
The old man you shot down in cold blood?
What does it matter to you anyway?
Everything!
It's time to pay, Marko.
Good riddance.
Re-ent!
Not now.
This is a free country. It's not a rent-free country.
Leave me alone.
Give me rent.
You'll get your rent when you fix this damn door!
That wasn't cool.
He is good boy.
He must be in some kind of trouble.
Flint Marko, the man who killed uncle Ben--
he was killed last night.
O my--
What happened?
Spider-Man killed him.
Spider-Man?
I don't understand.
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.
What happened?
I... He was...
I thought that you'd feel...
He deserved it, didn't he?
I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die.
Aunt May, he killed uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.
But he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts.
It's like a poison.
It can take you over.
Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.
Hello.
Hey, Harry, it's MJ.
Hi.
- I need some company.
Are you doing anything? Can I stop by?
Yeah, sure. Come on over.
OK. Are you sure it's OK?
I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.
OK, I'll see you soon.
Great.
- Bye.
Bernard?
- Yes, Mr Osborn?
We're having a guest. Can you get some food?
A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.
A guest guest?
Will you just get some food?
Rightaway, sir.
Hey, Mr Ditkovitch.
An orange?
No, thanks.
Listen--
I'm really sorry for what happened earlier.
I shouldn't have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about.
Ah, it's not big deal.
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza some time.
Today's good.
OK.
Have problem with the phone?
No, no, I was just-- was trying to figure out what to say.
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say: "You're a good woman,
"I'm good man."
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
He's calling a woman.
- Are you calling Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...
- It's none of your business.
Go! Go.
Give her a call.
- Thanks.
Bye.
- Bye.
You hungry?
Yeah.
Come in.
Hope you like peppers.
I love 'em.
Oh, the butter!
Well, we can use that part.
"You've been dreaming."
"Nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night."
All right.
- When did you write that?
- It's intense.
So, do you want the part?
I'd love to be in your play.
- Cheers.
You know, there's not even a scar.
Barely.
Sorry.
- Me too.
I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's OK. Please.
Forgive me.
Mary Jane.
Mary Jane.
Mary Jane, please!
- I'm sorry.
You've taken your eye off the ball.
What have you done?
Avenge me!
My father-- he died, right?
Yeah.
Just wish that I could remember more about him.
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.
I swear on my father's grave: Spider-Man will pay.
Harry.
Remember me?
Yes, father.
I remember.
I was right about her,
about Peter,
about everything.
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer. Make him wish he were dead.
First we attack his heart.
Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep.
Hey, MJ.
It's Peter.
I want to talk to you about last night.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I know you were just there to help, and--
I, uh-- I don't know, I want to see you.
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.
Yeah?
- It's Ursula.
Come in.
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
There's a phone call for you.
It's Mary Jane, she called back!
Really?
- Yeah!
I put the phone on top of the thing.
Thanks. OK.
Hey.
- Hi.
I was so glad you called.
I've been-- trying to--
- Can you meet me?
You bet.
- Now?
OK. Where?
At the bridge, in the park.
On my way.
Hey. I love you.
You look beautiful.
Peonies.
You OK?
No.
There's something I have to tell you, Pete.
- OK.
It's not working.
You and me.
What?
I don't want to see you anymore.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
I'm lonely.
You aren't there for me.
I can't do this.
It's over.
- No. Please.
Please don't say that.
I know, I've been selfish.
But I can do better. I can change.
- It's not that simple.
We love each other! I love you!
And we have problems. When people have problems, they work it out.
They talk to each other.
Look, you see?
You know what this is?
You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.
I've fallen in love with someone else.
She says that she's lonely,
and that I'm not there for her.
There's another guy.
How are you holding up?
Not good.
Harry, I was going to propose to her.
Really?
She's been going through a tough time lately.
Career.
I mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club--
that's not exactly what she had in mind for herself.
A singing waitress? What are you talking about?
She was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?
She was fired?
She was fired and she told you?
She didn't tell me?
That's why I asked you here, Pete.
I'm the other guy.
What?
Look, she came to me one afternoon, troubled.
She needed someone, and I was there for her.
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.
It just...
started.
I don't believe this.
I don't believe you.
I'm really sorry.
I just thought you should know.
Can I warm you up?
Yes, please.
How's the pie?
So good.
Would you like a drink?
I'm sorry.
What was I thinking? Bad for the public image, right, Mr Key-to-the-city?
What did you do to her?
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.
Mary Jane and I, we understand each other.
She doesn't know what you are.
Peter. She knows me very well.
And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.
That taste.
Strawberries.
How d'ya like that, Spidey?
That all you got?
Stinks, doesn't it?
I protected you in high school. Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.
You gonna kill me like you killed my father?
I'm done trying to convince you.
You took him from me.
He loved me.
No:
he despised you.
You were an embarrassment for him.
Look at that little Goblin junior.
Gonna cry?
"THIEF! Spider-Man shows his true colors"
- Spider-Man used to make me feel safe.
Now I'm afraid to walk home from work.
My son thought the world of this guy.
I have a 9 year old daughter, loves Spider-Man.
Who's she supposed to look up to now?
This is the guy they gave the key to the city to?
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.
Cheers! New staff photographer!
- I just got lucky.
This is so wonderful for you.
Well, you might wanna tell JJ to make a little more wall space.
Good morning.
- It's a beautiful day, huh?
What was it you said, I'll never get that picture?
There's your hero.
I never thought he'd really do that.
See? Right there,
you made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.
It's funny you should say that,
'cause I was looking through some old photos, and
looks very, uh-- similar.
OK-- Well, I gotta get back to work.
You're trash, Brock.
Excuse me?
Your picture is a fake.
Parker, you are such a boy scout.
When are you gonna give a guy a break?
You want forgiveness?
Get religion.
What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?
Yeah, no, we're just horsin' around.
Look, I'm begging you. If you do this,
I will lose everything.
There's not a paper in town that will hire me.
You should've thought of that earlier.
What are you doing, Peter?
Show this to the editor. Tell him to check his source next time.
It's a fake!
Empire State Photographic Department confirms it.
Pack your things. Get out of my building.
I was just...
- You're fired!
You know we're gonna have to print a retraction now.
Haven't printed a retraction in 20 years!
"SORRY SPIDEY
Bugle drops charges"
Shalom?
- Mr Parker?
Dr Connors here.
- Oh, Dr Connors!
How are you?
Quite a specimen you left me, Parker.
Its chemistry is not unlike the meteorites of the 70s.
Thanks. It's good.
You know what, Parker?
Parker?
Give me some milk.
It amplifies characteristics of its host.
Hey, give me another cookie.
Specially aggression.
This can be dangerous.
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?
You got any with nuts?
Um-- I have some nuts, I could make some.
Go make me some.
Peter?
- No, no. Of course not.
Your shots are so good.
I'd love to shoot you sometime.
Peter Parker! Peter...
Parker!
Miss Brent, that's not the position I hired you for!
Black suit Spider-Man!
Peter, these are incredible!
We gotta have these, Jonah.
I'll pay you the usual rate.
If you want the shots, I'll take the staff job. Double the money.
You are really gonna dig this joint.
Do you think I'm dressed all right?
Too fancy or...
You're looking fine, babe.
Thank you.
Love that little giggle.
Oh, this is so cool!
I have never been to a jazz club before.
I hope we can get a table.
Find us some shade.
Thanks, .
Right this way, sir.
"RESERVED"
Thank you.
I'm so loving this.
- Oh, me too.
Isn't that your old girlfriend?
Yeah.
Do you want to go someplace else?
No, no. I'll be OK.
Mary Jane, show us what you got.
I'll be right back.
- Right.
Peter?
This is for you.
Double time!
Thanks.
Now dig all this.
That was all for her?
I'm so sorry.
You all right, Mary Jane?
I'm fine.
- OK.
Hey.
What's wrong with you?
You.
Can I help you, sir?
No.
- Is everything OK here, Paul?
Yeah, is everything OK here, Paul?
Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.
Take your hand offa me. Now.
Peter, stop!
Who are you?
I don't know.
It's Brock, Sir.
Edward Brock junior.
I come before you today
humbled
and humiliated
to ask you for one thing.
I want you to kill Peter Parker.
Parker?
Hi, Peter.
- Hi.
You don't seem to have changed the room around very much.
Of course, there's not much you can do,
is there?
When we spoke on the phone,
I sensed something was bothering you,
so I thought I'd just come by.
How's Mary Jane?
I don't know.
I never heard from you.
Did you ever propose?
You said
a husband's gotta put a wife before himself.
I'm not ready.
But what happened?
You seemed so sure.
Yeah. I...
I heard her, aunt May.
I don't know what to do.
You start by doing the hardest thing.
You forgive yourself.
I believe in you, Peter.
You're a good person.
And I know you will find a way to put it right.
In time.
I don't like Spider-Man.
I want him dead too, Flint.
That's why I've been looking for you.
Oh yeah. I know all about you.
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.
It's just-- It doesn't seem right to me.
Look.
I wanna kill the Spider.
You wanna kill the Spider.
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.
Interested?
Yeah.
So--
where to?
"BREAKING NEWS: City in crisis"
- All New York is holding its breath
as a hostage crisis continues to unfold.
Just thirty minutes ago, police came across this startling sight:
A young woman held hostage in a taxi
suspended 80 storeys above the ground
in what appears to be a giant web.
Every attempt by the police to rescue the hostage
has been flaunted by the Sandman.
Compounding the danger is the appearance of a strange black-suited figure.
Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man. But he is now been identified
as something entirely different.
The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson,
an actrice recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway.
We're now going to take you live to the scene with Jennifer Dugan.
Jennifer?
- We're only about 100 feet away now, Hal, and--
Wait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web.
It seems to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering.
"SPIDER-MAN, STOP US IF YOU CAN"
Apparently, Spider-Man is being challenged to some sort of confrontation.
And that raises serious questions about what kind of chance he'd stand
against such overwhelming...
Harry.
I need your help.
Can't take them both. Not by myself.
You don't deserve my help.
Harry,
she needs us.
Get out.
If I may, Sir.
I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.
What are you trying to tell me?
The night your father died
I cleaned his wound.
The blade that pierced his body
came from his glider.
I know
you're trying to defend your father's honor,
but there's no question
that he died by his own hand.
I loved your father.
As I have loved you, Harry.
As your friends love you.
Look!
He seems to have come out of nowhere to answer the prayers of the city,
just when all hope seemed to be lost.
Peter?
They're gonna kill us both.
I'm gonna get you out of this.
Watch out!
Hey, Parker.
My God. Eddie?
Oh, my spider-sense is tickling.
If you know what I'm talking about.
We can find a way to settle this.
You're so right.
I'm thinking-- humiliation.
Kinda like you humiliated me.
Do you remember?
Do you remember what you did to me?
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.
How's that sound, tiger?
Hold on, Mary Jane!
Mary Jane.
It's hard to believe what's happening.
The brutality of it.
I don't know how he can take any more.
This can be a tragic day
for the people of New York.
It could be the end of Spider-Man.
Awesome!
- Wicked cool!
You came.
Looks like just in the nick of time.
A couple of minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either.
What're you gonna do.
I'm needing some help over here.
I'm a little busy right now.
Give me your hand!
Parker!
Parker, where...
I need a photographer!
Hey, kid. You want a job?
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.
All right, how much for the camera?
One hundred bucks.
- A hundred bucks?
All right, you little prick. Here.
Film's extra.
Gotcha.
Pete, watch out!
You still got any more?
- Hang on!
To what?
Go, buddy!
- Got her!
You OK?
Yeah.
Good.
Hey, Pete.
Am I interrupting?
Never wound
what you can't kill.
Eddie-- this suit-- you gotta take it off!
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
I know what it feels like.
It feels good.
The power. Everything.
But you'll lose yourself.
Let it go.
I like being bad.
It makes me happy.
Harry!
Peter, what are you doing?
No!
Eddie!
Harry?
- Mary Jane.
I'm going to get help.
Stay.
I didn't want this.
But I had no choice.
We always have a choice.
You had a choice when you killed my uncle.
My daughter was dying.
I needed money.
I was scared.
I told your uncle all I wanted was the car.
What is it?
- I need your car.
He said to me:
"Why don't you just put down the gun and go home?"
I realize now he was just trying to help me.
Then I saw my partner running over with the cash,
and the gun was in my hand.
Did a terrible thing to you.
I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back.
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I just want you to understand.
I've done terrible things too.
You didn't choose to be this.
The only thing left to me now
is my daughter.
I forgive you.
Hey, pal. How are you doing?
Been better.
We'll get you through this.
No.
You should never forgive...
...said those things.
None of that matters, Peter.
You're my friend.
Best friend.
Whatever comes our way.
Whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice.
My friend Harry taught me that.
He chose to be the best of himself.
It's the choices that make us who we are,
and we can always choose to do what's right.
I'm through with love
I'll never fall again
Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you
Or no one
And so I'm through with love
I've locked my heart
I'll keep my feelings there
I have stocked my heart
With icy frigid air
And I mean to care
For no one...

I feel like you're driving me to
court martial. This is crazy.
What did I do? I feel like you're
gonna pull over and snuff me.
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forest...
- We can talk, sir.
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
No, you intimidate them.
Dear God, you're a woman!
I honestly, I couldn't have called that.
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?
I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.
Well you have actually excellent
bone structure there. I'm kinda...
having a hard time not looking
at you now. Is that weird?
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.
It is true you went 12-for-12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no. March and I
had a scheduling conflict,
but fortunately the Christmas
cover was twins. Anything else?
You're kidding me
with a hand up, right?
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?
Yes, it's very cool.
I don't wanna see this
on your MySpace page.
Please, no gang signs.
No, throw it up, I'm kidding.
Yeah, peace! I love peace.
I'd be outta job with peace.
C'mon! Just click it, don't change
the settings, just click it.
What's going on?
Jimmy, stay with Stark!
Lie down!
Son of a bitch!
- Wait, wait, give me a gun!
- Stay here!
Tony Stark.
LAS VEGAS, 36 HOURS EARLIER
Visionary. Genius.
American patriot.
Even from an early age,
the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.
At age four, he built
his first circuit board.
At age six, his first engine.
And at seventeen, he graduated
Summa Cum Laude from MIT.
Then, the passing of a titan.
Howard Stark's life long friend
and ally Obadiah Stane,
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder.
Untill at age 21,
the prodigal son returns,
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.
With the keys to the kingdom,
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics,
satellite targeting.
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry,
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America and
her interests around the globe.
As liaison to Stark Industries,
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.
He is my friend and
he is my great mentor.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark!
Tony?
Thank you, Colonel.
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
This is wonderful.
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.
But if I were Tony...
...I would tell you
how honored I feel,
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.
Tony, you know,
the best thing about Tony...
...is also the worst thing -
he's always working.
C'mon!
We should just stay
till the morning.
- You are unbelievable!
- Oh, no. They roped you into this?
Nobody roped me into anything.
But they told me...
that if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you!
That's great. So when do we do it?
One more round. - There you go.
There it is. That was easy.
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK.
Wow, would you look at that?
That's... that's something else.
I don't have any of those
swooping around. All right, ride!
Give me a hand, will you?
OK, you too.
I don't blow on man's hands.
There it is! It's the Lieutenant
Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened,
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?
- This is where I exit.
- Tomorrow don't be late.
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know.
Render unto Caesar that which
is Caesar's. There you go.
Mr. Stark! Excuse me!
Mr. Stark!
Christine Everheart,
Vanity Fair magazine.
Can I ask you a couple of
questions? - She's cute.
- She's alright? Hi.
- Hi.
Yeah. Okay, go.
You've been called the Da Vinci of
our time. What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't paint.
And what do you say to your other
nickname, the Merchant of Death?
That's not bad.
Let me guess... Berkeley?
Brown, actually.
Well, Ms. Brown.
It's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.
I guarantee you the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,
we'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.
Rehearse that much?
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand.
All I want is the serious answer.
Okay, here is serious.
My old man had a philosophy:
"Peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy."
That's a great line, coming
from a guy selling the sticks.
My father helped defeat Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,
would call that being a hero.
And a lot of people would
also call that war-profiteering.
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved by
advancing medical technology?
Or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?
All those breakthroughs:
military funding, honey.
Wow, did you ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.
Good morning. It's 7 a.m.
The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.
The surf conditions are fair
with waist to sholder highlines,
high tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA
Tony? Hey, Tony!
You are not authorized to
access this area. - Jesus!
That's Jarvis, he runs the house.
I've got your clothes here, they've
been dry cleaned and pressed.
And there's a car
waiting for you outside
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.
You must be the famous
Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry cleaning?
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires.
Including occasionally taking out
the trash. Would that be all?
Give me the exploded view.
The compression in cylinder 3
appears to be low.
Note that.
- I'll try again later...
- Please don't turn down my music.
I'll keep you posted.
You are supposed to be half way
around the world right now.
- How did she take it?
- Like a champ.
Might've tried to
hustle me out of here.
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.
That's funny... I thought with
it being my plane and all,
that it would just wait
for me to get there.
I need to speak to you about couple of
things before I get you outta the door.
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the
purpose of having your own plane
if it departs before you arrive?
Larry called, he's got another
buyer for the Jackson Pollock
in the wings, do you
want it, yes or no?
Is it a good representation
of his Spring Period?
No the "Springs" is actually the
neighborhood in East Hampton,
where he lived and worked,
not "spring" like the season.
I think it's a fair example...
I think it's incredibly overpriced.
I need it. Buy it, store it.
Okay... the MI commencement speech.
Is in June... please, don't
harange me about that stuff.
Well, they are haragning me,
so I'm gonna say yes...
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.
It's your birthday. - Yes.
- I knew that. Already?
Yeah, isn't that strange,
it's the same day as last year.
Well, get yourself something
nice from me. - I already did.
- And?
- Oh, it was very nice.
Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
You're welcome, Ms. Potts.
You're good! I thought
I've lost you back there.
You did, sir.
I took it across Mojave.
- Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
What's wrong with you?
- What?
Three hours! - I got caught
doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
Three hours. For three hours,
you got me standing here.
I'm waiting on you now.
Lets go. C'mon.
Wheels up! Rock and roll!
What're you reading?
- Nothing.
C'mon, sourpatch,
don't be mad.
I told you I'm not mad,
I'm indifferent, okay?
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.
- No need to apologize.
- I told him I was sorry but he...
I'm just indifferent right now.
You don't respect yourself,
so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.
- I'm just your babysitter,
and so, when you need your
diaper changed, thank you...
let me know and I'll
get you a bottle, okay?
Hey, heat up the sake, will you?
Thanks for reminding me.
I'm not talking... we're not drinking,
we're working right now.
And you are constitutionally
incapable of being responsible.
It would be irresponsible
not to drink.
I'm just talking about
the night cup. - Hot sake?
- Yes, two please.
- No, just...
I'm not drinking,
I don't want any.
That's what I'm talking about.
When I get up in the morning,
and I'm putting on my uniform,
you know what I recognize?
I see in that mirror that every
person that's got this uniform
will get my back! - Here we
go again. I'm not like you.
No, you don't have to be like me.
But you're more than... yes you are.
Will you excuse me,
I'm a little bit distracted here.
No, you can't be distracted
right now. Listen to me!
BAGRAM AIR BASE,
AFGHANISTAN
General.
Welcome, Mr. Stark.
We look forward to your
weapons presentation.
Is it better to be feared
or respected?
And I say, is it too much
to ask for both?
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel
of Stark Industries freedom line.
It's the first missile system
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.
They say the best weapon is
one you never have to fire.
I respectfully disagree.
I prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.
That's how dad did it,
that's how America does it...
and it's worked out
pretty well so far.
Find an excuse to let
one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.
For your consideration,
the Jericho.
We throw one of these in with every
purchase of 500 million or more.
To peace!
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How did it go?
Went great, looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.
Hey, way to go, my boy.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
Why aren't you wearing
those pyjamas I got you?
Good night, Tony.
Hey Tony!
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee.
The hum-drum-vee is back there.
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
What the hell did you do to me?
What I did?
What I did is to save your life.
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.
Here, wanna see?
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.
We call them the walking dead.
Because in takes about a week for
the balls to reach the vital organs.
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet.
Hooked up to a car battery.
And it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.
That's right. Smile!
We met once, you know.
At the technical
conference in Bern.
- Don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.
Where are we?
Come on, stand up.
Stand up.
Do as I do.
C'mon, put your hands up.
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer
in the history of America."
He is honored.
He wants you to build a missile.
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.
This one.
I refuse.
Tony!
He wants to know
what you think.
I think he got a lot
of my weapons.
He says they have everything you
need to build a Jericho missile.
He wants you to make
the list of materials.
He says for you to start
working immediately,
and when you're done,
he will set you free.
No, I won't.
No, he won't.
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.
But they will never find
you in these mountains.
Look...
What you just saw...
that is your legacy, Stark.
Your life's work in the
hands of those murderers.
Is that how you want to go out?
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?
Or are you going to do
something about it?
Why should I do anything?
They're gonna kill me, you...
Either way, if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.
Well then... this is a very
important week for you, isn't it?
If this is gonna be my workstation,
I want it well lit,
I want all of these tools.
Welding gear, I don't care if it's
acetylene or propane.
I need a soldering station,
I need helmets,
I need goggles,
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets
of precision tools.
How many languages do you speak?
A lot. But apparently
not enough for this place.
They speak arabic,
urdu, dari, pashto,
mongolian, farsi, russian.
Who are these people?
They are your loyal
customers, sir.
They call themselves
The Ten Rings.
You know, we might
be more productive
if you include me in the
planning proces? - Aha.
Okay. We don't need this.
What is that?
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.
We need at least 1.6,
so why don't you go break
down the other eleven.
What are they doing?
Working.
Careful. Careful, we only
get one shot at this.
Relax, I've steady hands.
Why do you think
you're still alive, huh?
What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.
- Yinsen... nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Wow, that doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.
That's because it is a
miniaturized Arc reactor.
We got a big one powering
my factory at home.
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.
But what could it generate?
If my math is right,
and it always is...
three gigajoules per second.
That could run your heart
for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah.
Or something big for 50 minutes.
This is our ticket outta here.
- What is it?
'Flying the mountain' look.
Impressive.
Shesh Besh.
Good roll.
Good roll.
You still didn't tell me
where you're from.
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.
It's actually a nice place.
- You got a family?
- Yes.
And I will see them
when I leave here.
And you, Stark?
Nothing.
No.
So you're a man who has
everything... and nothing.
Doesn't look anything
like the photo.
Maybe he modified it.
- The tail doesn't seem right.
- Well, too bad.
Relax.
The bow and arrow once was the
pinacle of weapons technology.
It allowed the great Genghis Khan
to rule from the Pacific
to the Ukraine.
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great.
And four times the size
of the Roman empire.
But today,
whoever holds the latest
Stark weapons,
rules these lands.
And soon...
...it will be my turn.
Why did you fail me?
We're working on it.
Diligently.
I spared your life.
Is this how you repay me?
It's very complex.
We're trying hard.
On your knees.
You think I'm an idiot?
Tell me the truth.
We are working hard.
Open your mouth.
- What does he want?
- You think I'm a fool?
What is going on?
Tell me the truth.
We are working on Jericho.
What do you want,
a delivery date?
I need him.
He's a good assistant.
You have till tomorrow...
...to assemble my missile.
- Okay?
- Yes.
Can you move?
Say it again.
then 16 steps, left from
the door, four to the right.
Where is Stark?
He was here a moment ago.
Go find him!
Yinsen!
Yinsen!
Stark!
Say something.
He is speaking hungarian,
I don't...
- Speak hungarian.
- Okay...
What do you know?
- How did that work?
- Oh my goodness.
- It worked all right.
- What do I do?
- Let me finish this.
- Finish last powering sequence.
Okay.
Now! Tell me, tell me!
F 11. Tell me when you
see a progress bar.
It should be up right now.
Talk to me, tell me when
you see it. - I have it.
- Press Ctrl + I.
- Got it.
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over
here and button me up.
They are coming!
Doesn't need to look pretty,
just get it done.
They are coming.
Make sure that checkpoints are
clear before you follow me out, OK?
We need more time.
Okay.
I'm gonna go
buy you some time.
Stick to the plan!
Stick to the plan!
Yinsen!
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!
Stark.
Come on. We gotta go.
Move with me. C'mon, we got
a plan, we need to stick to it.
This was always the plan, Stark.
Come on, you're going to
go see your family again.
My family is dead.
I'm going to see them now, Stark.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I want this.
I want this.
Thank you for saving me.
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.
My turn.
Not bad.
How was the fun-vee?
Next time you ride with me, okay?
Watch it coming up here.
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.
Your eyes are red.
Few tears for your
long lost boss?
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.
Yeah, vacation's over.
Where to, sir?
Take us to the hospital, please.
- No. - No? Tony...
- You have to go to the hospital.
- I don't have to do anything.
I was in captivity for three months.
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger...
...and the other one...
- That's not going to happen.
It's not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.
Call for a press conference?
What on earth for?
Yeah, Hogan, drive.
Cheeseburger first.
Look at this!
Tony!
I thought you'll be
in a hospital.
Look at you!
Oh, burger, you had
to have a burger.
Did you get me one of those?
There was only one left,
I needed it.
Hey, look who's here!
- Ms. Potts?
- Yes.
May I speak with you
for a moment?
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.
I am not a reporter.
I'm agent Phil Coulson,
with the Strategic
Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.
We've been approached
already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...
We are a separate division.
With a more specific focus.
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.
- I'll put something in a book,
shell I? - Thank you.
Hey, would it be alright
if everyone sat down?
Will you sit down? That way
you can see me, and I can...
A little less formal...
What's up with the lovin'?
Don't look at me,
I don't know what he's up to.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
I never got to say
goodbye to dad.
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.
There's questions that
I would've asked him.
I would've asked him how he felt
about what his company did...
...if he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.
Or maybe he was every inch of a man
we all remember from the newsreels.
I saw young Americans killed...
...by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.
And I saw that I had
become part of a system
that is comfortable with
zero-accountability.
What happened over there?
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that
I have more to offer
this world than just making
things that blow up.
And that is why, effective
immediately, I'm shutting down
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International...
...untill such a time,
as I can decide
what the future of
this company will be,
what direction it should take,
the one I'm comfortable with,
and is consistant with the highest
good of this country and the world.
What we should
take away from this...
...is that Tony's back!
And he's healthier than ever.
We are gonna have a little
internal discussion
and we'll get back to
you with a follow-up.
- Where is he?
- He's inside.
That... that went well.
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?
Your head?
What about my head?
What do you think the over-under
on a stock drop is gonna be?
- Optimistically? 40 Points?
- At minimum.
Tony, we're a
weapons manufacturer.
Obie, I just... I don't want
the body count to be up...
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers, we make weapons.
My name is on facade
of the building.
What we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.
Not based on what I saw.
We're not doing a
good enough job.
We can do better, we're
gonna do something else.
Oh, like what? You want us
to make baby bottles?
I think we should take another
look into Arc Reactor technology.
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!
Tony, c'mon! We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.
The Arc was never cost-effective.
We knew that before we built it.
Arc Reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?
- Maybe.
- Am I right?
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that, in what... 30 years.
That's what they say.
Could you have a
lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?
- Never mind who told me.
- Show me.
- Rhodey or Pepper.
- I wanna see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.
It works.
Listen to me, Tony.
We are a team,
do you understand?
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,
like your father and I.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a
heads up, okay? But if I had...
Tony, no more of this
'ready - fire - aim' business.
- Do you understand me?
- That was dad's line.
You gotta let me handle this.
We're gonna have to play whole
different kind of ball now.
We're gonna have to
take a lot of heat.
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.
Stark Industries. I've got one
recommendation. Ready, ready?
Sell, sell, sell!
Abandon ship!
Does the'Hindenburg'
ring any bells?
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!
Pepper!
How big are your hands?
- What?
- How big are your hands?
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.
Hey!
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.
Let's see them.
Oh, wow, they are small.
Very petite, indeed.
I just need your
help for a sec.
Oh my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?
It was, it is now an antique.
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.
I was swapping it up
for an upgraded unit
and I just ran into a
little... speed bump.
Speed bump?
What's happening?
It's nothing,
it's just a little snag.
There's an exposed wire
under this device
and is contacting a socket wall
and is causing a little
bit of a short circuit.
What do you want me to do?
Put that on the table over
there. That is irrelevant.
I just want you to reach in...
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.
It's just like an operation,
you just don't let it
touch the socket wall.
- What's Operation?
- It's just a game, never mind.
- Just gently lift the wire.
- Okay. - Okay? Great.
You know, I don't think
that I am qualified to do this.
No, no, you're fine.
You're the most capable,
qualified and trustworthy
person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
Cause I really need your help here.
- Oh, there's pus!
- It's not pus.
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from
the device, not from my body.
- It smells!
- Yeah, it does.
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?
- I got it.
Now don't let it touch...
...the sides, that's what I was
trying to tell you before.
Okay, now make sure that
when you pull it out,
you don't pull out the magnet
and the end of it. That was it...
...that you just pulled out.
- Oh God. OK, what do I do?
- Don't put it back in!
- What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac
arrest cause you yanked out...
- What? I thought you said this
was safe! - We gotta hurry.
Take this, you gotta switch,
real quick. - Okay, okay.
Tony, it's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna make this okay.
You gotta touch
that to base plate.
And make sure you...
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?
I got it, I got it.
Nice.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.
Are you okay?
Don't ever, ever...
...ever ask me to do anything
like that ever again.
I don't have anyone but you.
Are we ready?
What do you want me
to do with this?
That? Destroy it.
Incinerate it.
You don't wanna keep it?
Pepper, I've been
called many things.
Nostalgic is not one of them.
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That would be all, Ms. Potts.
Hey butterfingers, come here.
What's all this stuff doing
on top of my desk?
That's my phone, that's
a picture of me and my dad...
Right there. In garbage.
All that stuff.
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?
I tell you, in my experience,
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,
his insight - that ability
to look into a situation
beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome.
Or pilot's judgement.
Colonel, it's... why not
a pilot without a plane?
Look who fell outta the sky!
Mr. Tony Stark.
Speaking about manned
or unmanned,
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong.
It's spring break,
just remember that.
Spring break 1987, that lovely
lady, what was his name?
Was it Ivan?
Don't do that, they'll believe it.
Don't do that.
Give us a couple
of minutes, you guys.
- I'm surprised.
- Why?
I swear I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.
I'm doing a little
better than walking.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Rhodey, I'm working
on something big.
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be part of it.
You're about to make a whole lotta
people around here real happy,
cause that little stunt at the
press conference, that was juicy.
This is not for the military.
I'm not... it's different.
What, are you humanitarian
now or something?
I need you to listen to me.
No, what you need is time
to get your mind right.
I'm serious.
It was nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks.
- Jarvis, are you up?
- For you sir, always.
I'd like to open a new
project file, index as: Mark 2.
Shell I store this on the Stark
Industries' central database?
I don't know who to trust
right now. Till further notice,
why don't we just keep everything
on my private server.
Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.
Maybe in mine it could
actually do some good.
Next.
Up.
Not the boot, Dummy, right here.
You got me?
Stay put. Nice.
And you, you're no better
at it at all. Lift... I got it.
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?
Up.
That's great, don't even move.
You... are a tragedy.
Okay, lets do this right.
Start mark, half meter
back of the center.
Dummy, look for light.
Stand back for fire safety.
You, roll it.
Activate hand controls.
We are gonna start up
nice and easy,
raising 10% thrust capacity
to achieve lift.
And 3, 2, 1.
Up two? Alright, step back.
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?
Yeah, everything's... what?
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great, I'll be right up.
I thought you said you were
done making weapons?
It isn't. This is
a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
How'd it go?
Oh, went that bad huh?
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York
doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
It would've gone better
if you were there.
You told me to lay low and
that's what I've been doing.
I lay low and you
take care of all the...
Hey, c'mon.
In public, the press...
This was a Board of
Directors meeting.
This was a Board of
Directors meeting?
The Board is claiming
a Post Traumatic Stress.
They are filing an injunction.
- A what?
They wanna lock you out.
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points?
We knew this was gonna happen.
- 56 and a half.
- It doesn't matter.
We own a controlling
interest in the company.
Tony, the Board has rights too.
They are making the case that
you and your new direction
isn't in a company's
best interest.
I'm being responsible.
That's a new direction.
For me... for the company.
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...
- Oh, this is great!
- Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!
- I'll be in the shop.
- Hey, hey, Tony, listen.
I'm trying to turn
this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.
Something to pitch them.
Let me have the engineers
analyze that, you know,
draw some specs.
- No.
No. Absolutely not.
This one stays with me.
That's it Obie.
Forget it.
Alright, well this
stays with me then.
Go on, here, you can have
a piece. Take two. - Thank you.
Do you mind if I come down there
to see what you're doing?
Good night, Obie.
Day 11, Test 37,
Configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.
Alright, nice and easy.
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.
And 3, 2, 1.
Please don't follow me around
with it either cause I feel
like I'm going to catch on fire
spontaneously. Just stand down.
If something happens,
then come in.
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%.
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be.
Not the car,
not the car.
It could be worse.
We are fine.
Okay, we are getting there.
Yeah. I can fly.
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.
Engage head up display.
Check.
Import all preferences
from home interface.
Will do, sir.
Alright, what do you say?
I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.
Start the virtual walkaround.
Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.
- Do a check on control surfaces.
- As you wish.
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.
Ah, yes... tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.
Start listening
the ground control.
Sir, there are still terabytes
of calculations needed
before an actual flight.
- Jarvis...
Sometimes you gotta run
before you can walk.
Ready? And 3, 2, 1.
It feels like a dream.
Alright, lets see what
this thing can do.
What's the SR-71's record?
The altitude record for fixed-wing
flight is 85.000 feet, sir.
Records are made
to be broken. C'mon!
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
build-up of ice occuring.
Keep going!
Higher!
We're iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps.
Jarvis?
C'mon, we gotta break the ice!
Cut power.
Note: main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.
The whole pressurization
is problematic.
I'm thinking 'icy' is
a probable factor.
A very astute observation, sir.
Perhaps if you intend to visit
other planets, we should
improve the exo systems.
Connect to the Cisco, have it
reconfigure the shell metals.
Use the gold-titanium alloy from
the Seraphim tactical satellite.
That should ensure
the fuselage integrity
while maintaining power
-to-weight ratio. Got it?
Yes. Shall I render using
proposed specifications?
Thrill me.
Tonight's red hot,
red carpeted,
right here at the
Disney Concert Hall,
where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit for
the Firefighters Family Fund
has become the place to be...
Jarvis, did we get
an invite from them?
I have no record of
the invitation, sir.
...haven't been seen in public
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.
Some claim he's suffering
from PTS and has been
bed ridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.
The render is complete.
Little ostentatious,
don't you think?
What was I thinking?
You're usually so dicsrete.
Tell you what... throw a little
hot rot red in there.
Yes, that shall help you
keep a low profile.
The render is complete.
Yeah, I like it.
Fabricate it and paint it.
Commensing an
automated assembly.
Estimated completion
time is five hours.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
The weapons manufacturing is...
only a one small part of what
Stark Industries is all about...
- Hey Tony, remember me?
- I sure don't.
You look great, Hef.
What's the world coming to when
a guy's gotta crash his own party?
Look at you!
- Hey, what a surprise!
- I'll see you inside.
Listen, take it slow, alright?
I got the Board where
I really want them.
You got it. Just cabin fever,
I'll just be a minute.
Give me a Scotch,
I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.
- Oh yeah, the guy from the...
Strategic Homeland
Intervention
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
God, you got... you need
a new name for that.
Yeah, I hear that a lot.
Listen, I know this must be
a trying time for you,
but we need to debrief you.
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,
and time can be a factor
with these things.
Lets just put something
on the books.
How about the 24th, at 7 p.m.
at Stark Industries?
Tell you what... you got it.
You're absolutely right.
Well... I'm gonna go to my
assistant and we'll make it date.
You look fantastic,
I didn't recognise you.
- What are you doing here?
- Avoiding government agents.
- Are you here by yourself?
- Where'd you get that dress?
It was a birthday present
from you, actually.
- I have great taste.
- Yes.
- You, uh, wanna dance?
- Oh, no, thank you. No.
Am I making you uncomfortable?
No, no.
I always forget to
wear a deodorant,
and dance with my boss
in front of everyone
that I work with,
in a dress with no back.
- You look great, you
smell great. - Oh, God.
But I could fire you,
if that'd take the edge off.
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.
- I'd make it a week.
Really? What's your
social security number?
- Five.
- Five?
You're missing just a
couple of digits there.
The other eight? That's why
I got you, for the other eight.
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.
- That was totally wierd.
- Totally harmless.
It was totally not harmless,
by the way.
- Nobody was watching us.
- Everybody who I work with...
I think you lost objectivity.
I think they... we just danced.
No, it was not
just the dance!
You don't understand
because you're you.
And everybody knows exactly who
you are, and how you are with girls.
And all that,
which is completely fine...
But you know, then me, you're
my boss and I'm dancing...
Because it makes me look like...
the one who's trying to...
I just think you're
overstating, that's all.
And we're here, and then I'm...
wearing this ridiculous dress...
And then we were
dancing like that and...
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it.
I would like a
vodka martini, please.
Very dry with olives,
lot of olives,
like at least three olives.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.
Make one of them dirty.
- Well... Tony Stark!
- Oh, hey!
Fancy seeing you here.
- Carrie. - Christine.
- That's right.
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.
Can I at least get
a reaction from you?
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.
I was reffering to your
company's involvement
in this latest attrocity.
- They just put my name
on the invitation,
I don't know what to tell you.
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.
I was out of town for a couple
of months, in case you didn't hear.
Is this what you call
accountability?
It's a town called Gulmira.
Heard of it?
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.
Well, I'm not my company.
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?
- What's going on? - Tony, you
can't afford to be this naive.
I was naive before,
when they said:
Here's the line, we don't cross it,
this is how we do business.
If we're double-dealing
under the table... are we?
Let's take a picture.
Come on.
Picture time!
Tony... who do you
think locked you out?
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.
It's the only way
I can protect you.
The fifteen miles hike
to the outskirts of Gulmira
can only be described
as a 'descent into Hell'.
Into a modern day
heart of darkness.
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages
have been driven
from their homes
displaced from their
lands by warlords,
emboldened by
a newfound power.
Villagers have been
forced to take shelter
in whatever ways
that they can find.
In the ruins of other villages
or here, in the remnants of
the old Soviet smelting plant.
Recent violence has been
attributed to a group
of foreign fighters, reffered to
by locals as the Ten Rings.
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.
A mission that can prove fatal to
anyone who stands in their way.
With no political will or
international pressure,
there's very little hope
for these refugees.
Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband
who was kidnapped
by insurgents.
Either forced to
join their militia...
...to anyone who will stop
a child's simple question:
"Where are my
mother and father?"
There's very little hope
for these refugees,
refugees who can only wonder
who, if anyone, will help.
Faster!
Women on the trucks!
The weapons here!
Abandon houses!
Hurry up!
Hold this rebel!
Put him with the others.
Father!
What the hell is this?
Kill this bastard!
You are incopetent!
Turn your head!
Father!
He is all yours.
AIR BASE EDWARDS,
CALIFORNIA
- What the hell was that?
- Are we clear to go in there?
No, sir. They were
using human shields.
We never got the green light.
Department of State,
they're gonna be all over this.
We got a bogey.
Is CIA on the line?
I got them on line,
they wanna know if it's us.
No, that definitely
is not us, sir.
- It wasn't navy.
- Wasn't marines.
I need answers! Can I please
get eyes on target?
Get me colonel Rhodes
from the Weapons developement
down here now!
We ran an ID check
and crossed reference
with all known databases.
We have nothing.
Any high-altitude surveillance
in the region?
We've got an AWAC and
a Global Hawk in the area.
So this things just
appeared out of nowhere?
How come it didn't
show up on the Radar?
It's got a minimum Radar
cross-section, sir.
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir. It's tiny.
We think it's an
unmanned aerial vehicle.
Colonel, what are we
dealing with here?
I'm gonna make a call.
- Hello?
- Tony?
- Who is this?
- It's Rhodes.
Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.
- Speak up, please.
- What the hell is that noise?
- I'm driving with the top down.
Yeah, well I need
your help right now.
It's funny how
that works, huh?
Yeah, speaking of funny,
we got a weapons depot
that was just blown up
a few cliques from where
you've been held captive.
- Well, that's a hot spot.
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did you job for you.
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?
- I was just jogging at the canyon.
- I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving to the
canyon where I'm gonna jog.
Are you sure you don't have
any tech in that area...
...I should know about?
- Nope.
Bogey spotted!
Okay, good, cause I'm
staring at one right now
and it's about to be
blown to kingdom come
War room, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sight.
- Whiplash One, what is it?
- I've got no idea.
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.
Then you are clear to engage.
Bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!
Incoming missile.
- Flairs!
Wait a second!
Bogey deployed flairs.
Deploy flaps!
Holly... this thing just
drove off the Radar, sir!
Satellite image has been lost.
- No way that's the U.A.V.
- What is it?
I can't see anything.
Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.
I think bogey has
been handled, sir.
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
- It's who?
I'm sorry, it IS me. You asked
what that was, and it was me.
No, see.. this isn't a game.
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.
You understand that?
It's not a piece of equipment.
I am in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Rhodey, you got anything for me?
Mark your position and
return to base. - Roger that.
On your belly!
It looks like a... man!
Shake him off!
Move, move!
I'm hit!
I'm hit!
Eject! Eject!
Whiplash One down.
- Whiplash 2, do you see a chute?
- Negative! No chute! No chute!
My chute's jammed!
Sir, I've got a visual
on a bogey.
Whiplash 2, reengage. If you
get a clear shot, you take it!
Major, we don't even know what we're
shooting at. Call off the Raptors.
That thing just took out an F-22
inside the legal no-fly zone.
Whiplash 2, if you have
a clear shot, take it.
They've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.
Keep going!
Got a chute!
Got a chute!
- Tony, are you still there?
- Hey, thanks.
Oh my God, you crazy
son of a bitch!
You owe me a plane,
you know that, right?
Yeah, well, technically
he hit me, so...
Now are you gonna come by and
see what I'm working on? - No, no.
The less I know the better.
Now what am I supposed
to tell to the press?
Training excercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?
It's not that simple.
An unfortunate
training excercise
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.
I'm pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.
As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,
it is still unclear who
or what intervened,
but I can assure you that the U.S.
government was not involved.
Oh, it isn't that bad, sir.
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.
Be gentle,
this is my first time.
I designed this to come off.
Please try not to move.
What's going on here?
Let's face it, this is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Welcome.
Compliments of Tony Stark.
If you killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.
Show me the weapon.
Come. Leave your
guards outside.
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.
So this is how he did it.
This is only a first crude effort.
Stark has perfected his design.
He has made a
masterpiece of death.
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.
And you dream of Stark's throne.
We have a common enemy.
We are still in business.
I will give you these designs...
...as a gift.
And in return...
...I hope you repay me
with a gift of iron soldiers.
This is the only gift
you will recieve.
Technology.
That's always been your Achilles
heel in this part of the world.
Don't worry. It will only
last for 15 minutes.
That's the least
of your problems.
Bring the armour
and the rest of it.
Alright, lets finish up here.
Set up Sector 16
underneath the Arc reactor.
And I want this dead and masked.
Recruit our top engineers.
I want a prototype right away.
Are you busy?
I need you to go to my office
and hack into the mainframe.
You're gonna retrieve all
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip,
this will get you in.
It's probably under
Executive Files, if not...
they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need to look
for the lowest
numeric heading.
And what do you plan to do
with this information
if I bring it back here?
- Same drill.
They've been dealing under
the table, I'm gonna stop them.
I'm gonna find my weapons
and destroy them.
Tony...
you know that I would
help you with anything,
but I can not help you if you're
gonna start all of this again.
There is nothing except this.
There's no art openings,
there's no benefit,
there's nothing to sign.
There's the next mission,
and nothing else.
Is that so?
Well, then I quit.
You stood by my side
all these years
while I reaped the
benefits of destruction.
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people
that I've put in harm's way,
your going to walk out?
You're gonna kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not gonna be a part of it.
I shouldn't be alive...
unless it was for a reason.
I'm not crazy, Pepper.
I just finally know
what I have to do.
And I know in my heart
that it's right.
You're all I have
too, you know.
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?
You did not tell us that
the target you paid us to kill
was the great Tony Stark.
As you can see,
Obadiah Stane, your deception
and lies will cost you dearly.
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.
So... what are we
gonna do about this?
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.
Ah, Tony. He always gets
the good stuff, doesn't he?
I was so happy...
when he came home. It was like
we got him back from the dead.
And now I realise...
...well, Tony never really
did come home, did he?
He left a part of himself
in that cave.
Breaks my heart.
Well...
He is a complicated person.
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be alright.
You are a very rare woman.
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.
Thank you. Thanks.
I gotta get back there.
Is that today's paper?
Yes.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.
- Of course.
Take care.
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.
Did you forget about
our appointment?
Nope. Right now,
come with me.
I'll give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.
We've been working our best.
Absolutely, we're... I'm gonna
have to call you back.
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored
what you've asked us
and it seems as though there's
a little hiccup, actually...
- A hiccup?
- Yes, to power the suit...
sir, the technology actually
doesn't exist. So it's...
Wait, wait, the technology?
William, here is
the technology.
I've asked you to simply
make it smaller.
Okay, sir, that's what
we're trying to do,
but honestly,
it's impossible.
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!
With a box of scraps!
I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.
Tony?
Tony, are you there?
Breathe.
Easy, easy...
You remember this one, right?
It's a shame the government
didn't approve.
There are so many applications
regarding short-term paralysis.
Ah, Tony.
When I ordered
the hit on you,
I was worried that I was...
...killing the golden goose.
But, you see...
it was just fate
that you survived it,
leaving one last
golden egg to give.
You really think that just
because you have an idea,
it belongs to you?
Your father, he helped to
give us the atomic bomb.
Now what kind of world
would it be today
if he was as selfish as you?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Ah, Tony...
This is your Ninth Symphony.
What a masterpiece!
Look at that.
This is your legacy.
The generation of weapons...
...with this at its heart.
The weapons that will help
stir the world back on course.
With the balance of power
in our hands.
In the right hands.
I wish you could see
my prototype.
It's not as... not as
conservative as yours.
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.
I would've prefered
that she lived.
What do you mean he paid
to have Tony killed?
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...
okay, where is Tony now?
I don't know, he's not
answering his phone.
Please go there and make
sure everything's okay.
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.
Good boy.
Tony?
Tony?
Tony?
Tony!
- Are you okay?
- Where is Pepper?
She's fine. She's with five agents
that are about to arrest Obadiah.
That's not gonna be enough.
Section 16.
Section 16...
There it is.
My key's not working,
it's not opening the door.
Wow, what is that? It's like
a little device, like a thing
that's gonna pick the lock?
-You may wanna take few steps back.
That's the coolest thing I've
ever seen. - Not bad, huh?
Let's do it.
You need me to do
anything else?
Keep the skies clear.
Damn!
Next time, baby.
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.
I thought it'll be bigger.
Take him out!
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is gonna hold up?
That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.
Keep me posted.
- Pepper.
- Tony?
- Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Obadiah, he's gone insane.
- I know. Listen!
- You better get outta there!
- He built the suit.
Get outta there, right now!
Where do you think
you're going?
Your services are
no longer required.
Stane!
- I love this suit!
- Put them down.
Collateral damage, Tony.
Defer the power
to chest piece.
Power reduced to 19%.
Lady!
For thirty years,
I've been holding you up.
I built this company
from nothing!
And nothing is gonna
stand in my way.
And least of all, you.
Impressive!
You upgraded your armour.
I've made some
upgrades of my own.
Sir, it appears that
his suit can fly.
Duly noted. Take me
to the maximum altitude.
With only 15% power, the odds
of reaching that altitude...
I know the math! Do it!
Sir, you're not gonna believe this.
That thing is back.
Get me major Allen.
Scramble the jets!
Not necessary, people,
just the training exercise.
- 13% power, sir.
- Climb!
-11%.
- Keep going!
- 7% power. - Just leave it on
the screen, stop telling me.
You had a great idea, Tony,
but my suit is more
advanced in every way!
How'd you solve
the icing problem?
Icing problem?
Might want to look into it.
We are now running on
emergency backup power.
- Potts!
- Tony!
Oh my God, are you okay?
I'm almost dead of power,
I gotta get out of this thing.
I'll be right there.
- Nice try.
Weapons status?
Repulsors are off line.
Flairs!
Very clever, Tony.
- Potts.
- Tony!
This isn't working, we're gonna
have to overload the reactor
and blast the roof.
- How are you gonna do that?
You're gonna do it.
Go to the central console,
open up bolt of circuits.
When I clear the roof
I'll let you know
and you're gonna hit
the master bypass button.
That's gonna fry
everything up here.
Okay, I am going in now.
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof, I'll buy you some time.
This looks important.
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,
but I must admit, I'm
deeply enjoying the suit.
You finally outdid
yourself, Tony.
It would've made
your father proud.
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!
Tony!
How ironic, Tony!
Trying to free
the world of weapons,
you gave it
the best one ever!
- Pepper!
- And now...
I'm gonna kill you with it!
You ripped up my
targeting system.
- Hit the button!
- You told me not to!
Hold still, you little prick.
- Just do it!
- You'll die!
Push it!
Tony!
We've all received
the official statement
of what occured at
Stark Industries last night.
There have been unconfirmed
reports that a robotic prototype
malfunctioned and caused
damage to the Arc reactor.
"Iron Man", that's kinda catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.
It's not technically accurate,
since it's a gold-titanium alloy,
but it's kinda attractive
name anyway.
Here is your alibi.
- Okay.
- You were on your yacht.
We told Pepper to put
you in Avalon all night
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.
I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me,
alone on the island.
That's what happened.
Just read it word for word.
There's nothing
about Stane here.
That's been handled.
He's on vacation.
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.
What about this whole story
that it's a body guard?
He's my body... ?
That's kinda flimsy.
This isn't my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.
Just stick to the official statement
and soon this will all be behind you.
You've got 90 seconds.
Oh, agent Coulson.
I just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
Right.
- Lets get the show on the road.
- You know, it's actually...
...not that bad... even I
don't think I'm Iron Man.
- You're not Iron Man.
- Yeah I am.
- You're not.
- Suite yourself.
If I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.
She'd be a wreck.
She'd always be worrying
that I was gonna die,
and yet proud of a man
I become. She'd be...
wildly conflicted, which
would only make her more...
crazy about me. Tell me you
never think about that night?
- What night?
- You know.
Are you talking about...
the night that we danced,
and went up to the roof...
and then...
you went downstairs
to get me a drink, and you...
left me there by myself?
Is that the night
you're talking about?
I thought so.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that'd be all, Ms. Potts.
And now Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.
He will not be taking
any questions, thank you.
It's been a while since
I was in front of you,
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.
There's been speculation that
I was involved in the events
that occured on a freeway
and the rooftop...
I'm sorry Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit,
that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that...
- I know that it's confusing...
It is one thing to question
the official story,
and another entirely
to make wild accusations
or insinuate that
I'm a superhero.
- I never said you're
a superhero. - You didn't?
Well, good, because that
would be outlandish and...
...fantastic.
I'm just not the hero type,
clearly. With this...
long list of character defects
and all the mistakes I've made,
largely in public.
- Just stick to the cards.
- Yeah, okay.
The truth is...
I am Iron Man.

Long ago that I'm
before Qty. but no evidence exists.
It has been said about my
participation on the events that occurred
- On the street ...
- Sorry, sir, but do not believe that the use
a bodyguard
be more appropriate.
Yes.
And if more
weapons in it.
One thing's have the official version and others
thing to do is point the finger
and say that I am a
kind of superhero.
You have to accept that I have
the kind of hero.
This long list of character defects
and the mistakes I made in public.
The point is ...
I am a man of iron.
- Am I wrong.
- Only some rest you will recover.
I can not go.
I'm wrong.
ARCA REACTOR
... We are in 4500 meters
we are about the area.
Nice to see them.
The late.
And I did.
I already did.
I'm not saying that the world has its
the longest period of uninterrupted peace
thanks to me.
I'm not saying I
spent in my captivity.
Something I had never
personified as good in history.
I'm not saying that our Uncle Sam is
not here anymore and rests in its mln.
Enjoying this because I
could find someone who is
Then, out and wins
my best day.
Thanks, do not talk about me.
I'm not talking about you
I'm not talking about us, talk
a legacy.
I speak of what we decided
leave for future generations.
That's why the entire year
and for the first time since 64.
The most brilliant men and women
nations and the corporate world
will pool resources and give us your
collective vision of how to build a better future.
Not for us, so as to
finish and I can tell you otherwise.
Welcomed the project.
And now I present to a client that is
special and will talk about it.
I ask for applause
for my father Howard.
Anything is possible with technology.
Better life, good health.
And for the first time in history
of humanity, the ability
world peace.
On behalf of everyone here I STARK INDUSTRY
personally presented the city's future.
The technology lets
potential for many humans.
TOXICITY 200%
Soon the technology will affect
how they live their daily lives.
Nothing more tedious, leave this
time for other activities.
And enjoy the sweet life.
That is Expo Stark welcome.
It is fully active
exhibition is the inauguration
and everyone tries to leave the scene.
If they can not come, do not worry
lasts all year.
You may be here in the halls stock with
inventions that come from all over the world.
Ready here we go.
Hello friends, thank you
for coming. That's cute.
Hello
What is this?
On one side you.
- Wow.
- Your autograph.
Good.
- EL is Aby.
- The teacher today.
Call me to talk, call me.
I will.
Hey friend, this is the best.
Many more opportunities.
- Many hands really.
- It was not so bad.
- If you came out perfect.
- What Car? It is the latest model.
- And it comes with the car?
- Well, I hope so.
- Hello
- Hello
- And you are?
- I'm Poli.
- This is weird.
- It's a great pleasure.
I drive, do you mind?
Where are you?
- From Redcord.
- What are you doing here?
- Buscandote.
- So here I am.
- And then?
- Bring subpoenas.
- Do not receive service.
- Yes, I'm not.
- I maintain it.
- Having been summoned to appear in
Services Committee
tomorrow at 9:00.
- So you're a cop?
- I am the federal police.

Mr Personality Summary
Stark is obsessive-compulsive disorder.
In my defense, it was last week.
Obvious destructive tendencies,
going to die, please.
And all I have.
Classic case "Narsizismo?
Right.
Another is here, the evaluation of recruitment
for the project Avenger, Iron Man himself.
- I have to think about it.
- Continued.
Stark Tony, is not recommended?
I do not see the point, as
approved and disapproved?
I have a new heart, I am
be good with Peppers.
I have a semi-stable relationship.
What makes us think that this operation
is that only you will use a consultant.
They have to be paid.
Although this may save salary
If instead you do me a favor.
They're coming and I'll be decorated Rhodey
Washington y. ..
Nobody comes.
I'll see what I can do.
It is a pleasure and an honor
deliver these two medals to Lt. Col.
Mr. James Rhodes and Tony Stark.
Who is a great ...
A great national treasure.
Thank you for your lieutenant colonel
excepsional action on the field.
- He deserves it.
- Thanks.
Thanks to Mr. Stark excepsional
performance.
He deserves it.
Sorry.
With his career just a painful sting.
Get ready for shooting.

The Tesseract has awakened.
It is on a neutral world, a human world.
They wield its power,
but our ally knows it's working, so that they never will learn.
He's ready to lead, and our force, our Chitauri will follow.
The world will be his and the universe yours.
And the humans, what can they do, but burn.
How bad is it?
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hour ago.
NASA didn't authorize Selvig to pull the test phase.
He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement
It just turned itself on?
What are the engine levels now?
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac.
How long to get everyone out?
Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
Do better.
Sir, evacuation maybe futile.
We should tell them to go back to sleep?
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,
there may not be a minimum safe distance.
I need you to make sure that phase
Sir, is that really a priority right now?
Until such time as the world ends,
we will act as though it intends to spin on.
Clear out the tech below. Every piece of phase 2 on a truck and gone.
Yes, sir. Come with me.
Talk to me, Doctor.
- Director.
- Is there anything we know for certain?
- Tesseract is misbehaving.
- Is that supposed to be funny?
No, it's not funny at all.
The Tesseract is not only active, she's...misbehaving.
-How soon until you pull the plug?
She's an energy source.
If we turn off the power, she turns it back on.
- If she reaches peak level...
- We've prepared for this, doctor.
- Harnessing energy from space.
- We don't have the harness.
Our calculations are far from complete.
Now she's throwing off interference, radiation
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.
That can be harmful.
Where's Agent Barton?
The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
Agent Barton, report to me.
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things.
- I can see better from a distance.
- Are you seeing anything that might
- set this thing off?
- Doctor, it's spiking again.
No one come or gone.
It's oven is clean.
No contacts, no I.M.'s.
If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.
- At this end?
- A cube of space, one end of the door.
Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.
Sir, please put down the spear!
You have a heart.
Please don't.
- I still need that.
- This doesn't have to get any messier.
Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else.
I am Loki of Asgard,
- and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
- Loki, brother of Thor?
We have no quarrel with your people.
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
- You planning to step on us?
- I come with glad tidings,
- of a world made free.
- Free from what?
Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
Once you accept that, in your heart...
You will know peace.
Yeah, you say peace, I kind of
think you mean the other piece.
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.
This place is about to blow
Drop a hundred feet of raw material,
he means to bury us.
- Like The Pharaohs of Odin.
- He was right.
He's right, the portal is collapsing in on itself.
You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
Drop him.
Need these vehicles.
- Who's that?
- He didn't tell me.
Hill, do you copy? Barton is....
He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
ets go, no no no.. leave leave, go.
We cleared upstairs, sir.
We need to go.
Director? Director Fury , do you copy?
The Tesseract is with the hostile force.
I have men down. Hill?
A lot of men still under,
don't know how many survivors.
Sound the general call,
I want every living soul not needing rescue
- looking for that briefcase.
- Roger that.
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a level seven.
As of right now, we are at war.
What do we do?
Subtitle By JAVANI
I do not want to end tonight.
I want to know how
for it to end.
Believe me, you must
to be better prepared.
Do you work?
Lermentoville?
Is he confident that we will do -
transport without him?
I thought that a General
Tchalakov handle exports.
Tchalakov. Running Boy, doll.
Outdated information
derived from the fall.
Famous Black Widow
it's just a pretty face.
Do I feel beautiful?
We do not need Lermentovia
transport tank.
Tell him that we give up
medium term by hand. It's true ...
You may have to write it down.
Yes?
You ask.
- Listen carefully ...
- Silenskin box 114, the third floor.
F-22 close to you 13 draw
kilometer radius.
Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.
- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding? I'm working!
- This takes precedence.
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this
moron is giving me everything.
I don't give everything.
- Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.
- Natasha.
Barton's been compromised.
Let me put you on hold.
- Where's Barton now?
- We don't know.
- But he's alive.
- We think so.
I'll brief you on everything when you get back.
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts
me about as far as he can throw me.
No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
Oh, God.
- Do not come here!
- Who are you?
Go away. Here is a disease.
Are you a doctor?
My father did not wake up!
Body heat, and he
make noise, but did not open his eyes.
A slower rate.
My father ...
And when they?
Please...
Should have got paid up front, Banner.
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress,
you picked a hell of a place to settle.
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
-Then what is it? Yoga?
ou brought me to the edge of the city, smart.
I uh...assume the whole place is surrounded?
Just you and me.
And your actress buddy, is she a spy too?
Do you start that young?
- I did.
- Who are you?
Natasha Romanoff.
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.
No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
SHIELD. How did they find me?
We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance,
even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.
- Why?
- Nick Fury seems to trust you.
But now I need you to come in.
- What if I say no?
- I'll persuade you.
And what if the...other guy says no?
You've been more than a year without an incident.
I don't think you wanna break that streak.
I don't get every time what I want.
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.
- Well, those I actively try to avoid.
- This is the
Tesseract.
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
- What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
- Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken.
It omits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.
If there was, that's where I'd be.
- So Fury isn't after the monster?
- Not that he's told me.
And he tells you everything?
- Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
- He needs me in a cage?
- No one's gonna put you in a...
- Stop lying to me!
I'm sorry, that was mean.
I just wanted to see what you'd do.
Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that,
and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay?
Natasha.
Stand down. We're good here.
Just you and me?
This is out of line, Director.
You're dealing with forces you can't control.
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?
Did you feel an over abundance of control?
You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
Not Asgard. Loki.
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one? His brother.
Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile.
But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help either.
It's up to us.
Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2,
- it was designed for exactly...
- Phase 2 isn't ready, our enemy is.
- We need a response team.
- The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
- This isn't about The Avengers.
- We have seen the list.
We're running the world's greatest
covert security network
and you're gonna leave the fate of
human race to a handful of freaks.
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.
We need a response team.
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even,
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.
- You believe?
- War isn't won by sentiment, Director.
No, it's won by soldiers.
There's not enough time. I'm gotta
pull into the water.
- You wont be alone.
- .Oh God.
This guy is still alive.
Trouble sleeping?
I slept for 70 years, Sir.
I think I've had my fill.
Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.
I went under, the world was at war,
I wake up, they say we won.
They didn't say what we lost.
We've made some mistakes along the way.
Some very recently.
- You here with a mission, sir?
- I am.
- Trying to get me back in the world?
- Trying to save it.
Hydra's secret weapon.
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you.
He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to
unlimited sustainable energy.
That's something the world sorely needs.
- Who took it from you?
- He's called Loki.
He's not from around here.
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.
The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.
Ten bucks says you're wrong.
There's a debriefing package waiting
for you back at your apartment.
Is there anything you can tell us
about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
You should have left it in the ocean.
You're good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.
You disconnected the transition lines?
Are we off the grid?
Stark Towers is about to become a
beacon of self sustaining clean energy.
Wow, so maybe our reactor takes over
and it actually works?
I assume. Light her up.
- How does it look?
- Like Christmas, but with more...me.
Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign.
You need to do some press.
I can do some more tomorrow,
I'm working on the zoning for the next billboards.
Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
Enjoy the moment.
I remember.
Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.
I'm not in. I'm actually out.
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.
Levels are holding steady...I think.
Of course they are, I was directly involved.
Which brings me to my next question.
- How does it feel to be a genius?
- Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?
What do you mean? All this, came from you.
No. All this, came from that.
Give yourself some credit, please.
Stark Tower -
Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself, twelve percent of the credit.
- Twelve percent?
- An argument can be made for fifteen.
- Twelve percent for my baby?
- Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
- My private elevator.
- You mean our elevator?
It was teeming with sweaty workmen.
I'm going to pay for that comment about
percentages in some subtle way later on, aren't I?
Not gonna be that subtle.
I'll tell you what. Next building
is gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
- On the lease.
- Call your mom, can you bunk over?
Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid
my protocol's are being overwritten.
Stark, we need to talk.
You have reached the life model
decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
- This is urgent.
- Then leave it urgently.
- Security breach. That's on you.
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.
- Phil.
- I can't stay.
- Uh...his first name is Agent.
- Come on in, we're celebrating.
- Which is why he can't stay.Soon as possible.
- I don't like being handed things
- That's alright, cause I love to be handed things.
So, let's trade.
Thank you.
Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
- This isn't a consultation.
- Is this about The Avengers?
- Which I...I know nothing about.
- The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.
- And I didn't even qualify.
- I didn't know that either.
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self obsessed, don't play well with others.
- That I did know.
- This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
- Whatever. Miss Potts, got a sec?
- You know, I thought we were having a moment.
- I was having twelve percent of a moment.
This seems so serious, Phil's pretty shaken.
- How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
- What is all this?
This is uh...
This.
- I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.
- Tomorrow.
You have homework. You have a lot of homework.
Well, what if I didn't?
If you didn't?
You mean if you finished?
Then ...
Square deal. It's the last date.
Work hard.
- Do you drive past the airport, by chance?
- I can drop you.
Oh, fantastic. Does the cellist
You? Is it true relationship?
- He moved back to Portland.
- What?
We are a forty-minute
from the base, sir.
So this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?
A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero.
Banner thought gammer radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.
- Didn't really go his way, did it?
- Not so much.
When he's got that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
He's like a smart person.
I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially.
I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping.
I mean, I was...I was present while you were unconscious from the ice.
You know, it's really, it's just a...just a huge honor to have you on board.
- Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
- Oh, you are. Absolutely.
Uh...we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.
The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little...old fashioned?
Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light,
people might just need a little old fashioned.
- The Chitauri grow restless.
- Let them grow restless.
- I will lead them in the glorious battle.
- Battle? Against a meagre might of earth?
- Glorious, not lengthy.
If your force is as formidable as you claim.
You question us?
Question him?
He who put the scepter in your hand?
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose?
When you were cast out, defeated!
I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard. Betrayed.
Your ambition is little and full of childish need.
We look beyond the earth to great worlds
The Tesseract will avail.
You don't have the Tesseract yet.
I don't threaten.
But until I open the doors,
until your force is mine to command, you are the wars.
- You will have your war as guardian.
If you fail, -
if the Tesseract is kept from us,
there will be no realm, no barren moon,
no crevasse where I can't find you.
You think you know pain?
You will receive something sweet as pain.
- Get your captain equipment.
- All right.
Agent Romanoff , he's Captain Rogers.
- They need you on the bridge.
- See you there.
There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
- Trading Cards?
- They're vintage, he's very proud.
Dr. Banner.
Oh, yeah. Hi.
- They told me you'd be coming.
- Word is you can find the cube.
- Is that the only word on me?
- Only word I care about.
Must be strange for you, all of this.
- Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
- Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute.
It's gonna get a little hard to breath.
Is this is a submarine?
Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container?
Oh, no. This is much worse.
- All engine operating.SHEILD
emergency protocol,1 9 3.6 in effect. We're in, sir.
- Good.
- Lets vanish.
- Engage retro reflection panels.
- Reflection panels engaged.
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor, thank you for coming.
- Thanks for asking nicely.
- So, uh...how long am I staying?
- Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.
Where are you with that?
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible camera on the planet.
Cell phones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite,
- it's eyes and ears for us.
- That's still not gonna find them in time.
You have to narrow the field.
How many spectrometers do you have access to?
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know,
tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof
and calibrate them for gamma rays.
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition.
At least we could rule out a few places.
- Do you have somewhere for me to work?
- Agent Romanoff,
would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please.
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.
- Put over there.
- Is this the stuff you need?
- Yeah, Iridium.
It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons.
- It's very hard to get hold of
- Specially if SHIELD knows you need it.
Well, I didn't know!
The Tesseract is showing me so much.
It's...it's more than knowledge, it's truth.
I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?
- My next target.
- Tell me what you need.
I need a distraction.
And an eyeball.
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.
No, no. It's fine.
It's a vintage set.
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.
Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but...
We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match.
Weight, cross match, seventy nine percent.
- Location?
- Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Canning Strasse.
- He's not exactly hiding.
- Captain,
you're up.
Kneel before me.
I said.
Kneel!
Is not this simpler?
Is this not your natural state?
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,
that you crave subjugation.
The bright lure of freedom diminishes
your life's joy in a mad scramble for power,
and identity.
You were made to be ruled.
In the end, you will always kneel.
Not to men like you.
- There are no men like me.
- There are always men like you.
Look to your elder, people.
Let him be an example.
You know, the last time I was in Germany
and saw a man standing above everybody else,
we ended up disagreeing.
I'm not the one who's out of time.
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
Kneel.
Not today!
The guy's all over the place.
Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
Make your move, Reindeer names.
Good move.
- Mr Stark.
- Captain.
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not a word.
Just get in here.
We're low on time.
- I don't like it.
- What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
I don't remember it being that easy.
This guy packs a wallop.
Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow.
- What's your thing? Pilates?
- What?
It's like calisthenics.
You might have missed a couple things,
you know, doing time as a Capsicle.
- Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
- Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.
Where's this coming from?
What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
I'm not overly fond of what follows.
- Now there's that guy.
- Another Asgardian?
- Think the guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
- Stark, we need a plan of attack.
- I have a plan. Attack.
- I'd sit this one out, Cap.
- I don't see how I can.
These guys come from legends, they're basically Gods.
There's only one God, ma'am.
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
- Where's the Tesseract?
- I missed you too.
- Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
- Oh, you should thank me.
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy did the
All-Father have to muster to conjure you here?
Your precious earth.
I thought you dead.
Did you mourn?
- We all did.
Our father...
- Your father.
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?
We were raised together.
We played together, we fought together.
- Do you remember none of that?
- I remember a shadows.
living in the shade of your greatness.
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.
- I who was and should be king!
- So you take the world I love as recompense for
your imagined slights?
No, the earth is under my protection, Loki.
And you're doing a marvelous job with that.
The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you ideally threat.
- I mean to rule them. That's why should I not...
- Think yourself above them.
- Well, yes.
- Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.
A throne would suit you ill.
I've seen worlds you've never known about.
I have grown, Odin's son, in my exile.
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract. And when I wield it...
Who showed you this power?
Who controls the would be king?
- I am the king!
- Not here!
You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream!
You come home.
I do not have it.
You need the cube to bring me home,
but I've sent it off. I know not where.
You listen well, brother.
I'm listening.
- Do not touch me again.
- Then don't take my stuff.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Uh...Shakespeare in the park.
Doth mother know, you weareth her drapes?
This is beyond you, metal man.
Loki will face Asgardian justice.
He gives up the cube and he's all yours. Until then,
stay out of the way.
Tourist.
Okay.
How about that.
Thats enough!
- Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.
- I've come here to put and end to Loki's schemes!
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.
Uh...yep! No! Bad call! He loves his hammer!
You want me to put the hammer down?
Are we done here?
In case it's unclear, you try to escape,
you so much as scratch that glass.
Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap.
You get how that works?
Ant.
Boot.
It's an impressive cage.
Not built, I think, for me.
Built for something a lot stronger than you.
Oh, I've heard.
The mindless beast, makes play to be the man.
How desperate are you? You call on these lost creatures to defend you.
How desperate am I?
You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.
You talk about peace and you kill
cause it's fun.
You have made me very desperate.
You might not be glad that you did.
Ooh. It burns you to come so close.
To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power.
And for what?
A world for all mankind to share,
- and then to be reminded what real power is.
\- Well let me know if real power will want some magazine or something./
- He really grows on you, doesn't he?
- Loki's gonna drag this out.
- So, Thor, what's his play?
- He has an army called the Chitauri,
that none of Asgard nor any world know.
He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth.
- Return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
- An army,
- from outer space.
- So he's building another portal.
- That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
- Selvig?
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.
Loki has him under some kind of spell,
- along with one of ours.
- I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
- He's not leading an army from here.
- I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.
I don't care how you speak.
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.
He killed eighty people in two days.
- He's adopted.
- I think its about the mechanics.
- Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?
- It's a stabilizing agent.
Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
No hard feelings Point Break, you've got a mean swing.
Also, it means the portal can open as wide,
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.
That man is playing gallaga.
Thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.
- How does Fury even see these?
- He turns.
Sounds exhausting.
The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.
Only major component he still needs is a power source.
A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
Last night.
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the Extraction Theory papers.
Am I the only one who did the reading?
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
He got to heat the cube to a hundred and
twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect.
Well, if he could do that he could achieve
Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.
Finally, someone who speaks English.
- Is that what just happened?
- It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled.
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control
and turn into an enormous green rage monster.
- Thanks.
- Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube.
- I was hoping you might join him.
- Let's start with that stick of his
It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube.
And I'd like to know how Loki used it to
turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.
- Monkeys? I do not understand.
- I do.
- I understood that reference.
- Shall we play it, Doctor?
- This way, Sir.
The gamma readings are definitely
consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract.
- But it's gonna take weeks to process.
- If we bypass their mainframe
and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster,
we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.
All I packed was a tooth brush.
You know, you should come by Stark Towers sometime.Top ten floors, all R and D.
- You'd love it, it's candy land.
- Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I
kind of broke Harlem.
Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension.
No surprises.
- Nothing?
- Are you nuts?
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret?
- Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.
- No offense, Doctor.
- No, it....it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't
- handle pointy things.
- You're tiptoeing, big man.
- You need to strut.
- And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.
You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now?
Why not before? What isn't he telling us.
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
- You think Fury's hiding something?
- He is a spy.
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets.
It's bugging him too, isn't it?
- Uh, I just wanna finish my work here and...
- Doctor?
A world for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.
- I heard it.
- Well, I think that was meant for you.
Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.
The Stark Tower? That big ugly......, building in New York?
It's powered by Stark Reactors, self sustaining energy source.
- That building will run itself for what, a year?
- That's just the prototype.
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
So why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project?
I mean, What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?
I should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.
- I'm sorry, did you say.....?
- Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.
In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.
- Blueberry?
- Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically not possible.
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed.
We have orders, we should follow them.
Following is not really my style.
And you're all about style, aren't you?
Of the people in this room, which one is; a-wearing a spangly outfit, and b- not of use?
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?
Just find the cube.
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?
Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
The guy's not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us.
What he's got is an acme dynamite kit.
It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does..
And I'll read all about it.
Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
I'm exposed, like a nerve.
- It's a nightmare.
- You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel,
trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.
This stops it. This little circle of light.
It's part of me now, not just armor.
- It's a terrible privilege.
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.
- It's different.
Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gammer exposure should have killed you.
So you're saying that the Hulk,
the other guy, saved my life?
That's nice.
It's a nice sentiment.
Save it for what?
I guess we'll find out.
- You may not enjoy that.
- You just might.
As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster.
We've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee.
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.
- She'll be safe.
- Thank you.
It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig.
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.
- Erik is a good man.
- He talks about you a lot.
You changed his life.
- You changed everything around here.
- They were better as they were.
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we.
We come here battling like Bilchsteim.
- Like what?
- Bilchsteim. You know; huge, scaly, big antlers.
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.
They are repulsive, and
they trample everything in their path.
When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price.
And now again,
n my youth I courted war.
War hasn't started yet.
You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield,
it's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance upon me.
There's no pain that would prise his need from him.
A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.
- What are you asking me to do?
- I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?
Loki is a prisoner.
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?
There's not many people that can sneak up on me.
-But you figured I'd come after.
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,
you would appear as a friend,
as a balm.
- And I would cooperate.
- I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.
I'd say I've expanded his mind.
And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain.
What happens to his mind?
- Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
- Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
Tell me.
Before I worked for SHIELD, I
I made a name for myself.
I have a very specific skillset.
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.
I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way.
Agent Barton was sent to kill me,
he made a different call.
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
- I'll not let you out.
- Ah, no. But I like this
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?
Regime's fall everyday.
I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian,
Or I was.
- And what are you now?
- It's really not that complicated.
I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.
Can you?
Can you wipe out that much red?
Drakoff's daughter?
Sao Paulo?
The hospital file?
Barton told me everything.
Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red,
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?
This is the basest sentimentality.
This is a child at prayer.
Pathetic.
You lie and kill
in the service of liars and killers.
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,
something that makes up for the horrors.
But they are a part of you,
and they will never go away.
I won't barter Barton! Not until I make him kill you.
Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work,
and when he screams I'll split his skull
This is my bargain, you mewling quin!
You're a monster.
Oh, no.
You brought the monster.
- So, Banner? That's your play?
- What?
Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way.
Set the door locked.
Thank you, for your cooperation.
- What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
- kind of been wondering the same thing about you
- You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
- We are, the model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now.
When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.
And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.
What is Phase 2?
Phase 2 is SHIELD used the cube to make weapons.
-Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.
-Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.This does not
\ - mean that we're./
- I'm sorry, Nick.
What were you lying?
- I was wrong, Director. The world hasn't changed a bit.
- Do you know about this?
- You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?
- I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.
- Loki's manipulating you.
- And you've been doing what exactly?
- You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
- Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.
I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
Because of him.
- Me?
- Last year earth had a visitor from another planet
who had a grudge mass that levelled a small town.
We learned that not only are we not alone,
but we are hopelessly, hilariously
- out gunned.
- My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
But you're not the only people out there, are you?
And, you're not the only threat.
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,
- they can't be controlled.
- Like you controlled the cube?
You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.
It is the signal to all the realms that the
earth is ready for a higher form of war.
- A higher form?
- You forced our hand.We had to come up with something.
A nuclear deterrent.
cause that always calms everything right down.
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?
- I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep...
- Wait, Wait, Hold on. How is this now about me?
- I'm sorry, isn't everything?
- I thought humans were more evolved than this.
- Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?
- We can..
- You speak of control, yet you court chaos.
- It's his M.O., isn't it?
I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.
We're...we're a time-bomb.
- You need to step away.
- Why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?
- You know damn well why! Back off!
- Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.
Yeah, big man in a suit of armor.
- Take that off, what are you?
- Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.
I've seen the footage.
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
I think I would just cut the wire.
Always a way out.
You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero
A hero, like you?
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.
Put on the suite, let's go a few rounds.
- You people are so petty, and tiny.
- Yes, right.
- Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his
- Where? You're renting my room.
- The cell was just...
- In case you needed to kill me.
but you can't! I know, I tried.
I got low,
I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out.
So I moved on, I focused on helping other people.
I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show.
and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret,
Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?
Dr. Banner.
put down the scepter.
All right.
- Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my party trick after all.
- Located the Tesseract?
- I can get there faster.
- The Tesseract belongs on Asgard,
- no human is a match for it.
- You're not going alone!
You gonna stop me?
Put on the suit, let's find out.
- I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
- Put on the suit.
Oh, my God.
- Put on the suit!
- Yep.
- Hill!
- Its a detonation. Number three engines is down.
-We're been hit.
-Fire engines.
- Talk to me.
- Turbine looks mostly intact, -
but it is impossible to get out there and repair when we already there.
If we lose one of engine we wont be.
- Someone gonna get outside and patch the engine.
- Stark, did you capy that?
- I'm on it.
Okay.
You okay right?
Keep that engine down.
Attention.wait the cameras going dark.
Stay close.
Level four.
Engine three. I'll meet you there.
Doctor.
Bruce, you gotta fight.
This is just what Loki wants.
We're gonna be okay. Listen to me.
We're gonna be okay. Right?
I swear on my life I will get you out of this,
you will walk away, and never...
Your life?
Bruce.
We have been carrying 180 to the south. Takes us to the water.
Free wind. Navigation
recalibration after the engine failure.
- Is the sun coming up?
- Yes sir.
Then put it on the left.
Takes us on the water.
One more turbine goes down
we're trapped.
Stark!
- Stark, I'm here!
- Good.
See what we got.
I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online
before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.
I need you to get to that engine control panel
and tell me which relays are in overload position.
What's it look like in there?
It seems to run on some form of electricity.
Well, you're not wrong.
We're not your enemies, Banner.
Try to think.
The relays are intact.
- What's our next move?
- Even if I clear the rotors,
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.
- I'm gonna have to get in there and push.
- Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.
Then stay in the control unit and reverse
polarity long enough to disengage mag..
- Speak English.
See that red lever?
It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.
Stand by it, wait for my word.
I need full evac on lower deck.
Grenade.
We gotta perimeter breach.
Hostile wiped SHIELD gear.
Hulk and Thor are in the research level
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!
- Get his attention.
- Escorts, Six o proceed to the.
- Don't get too close.
Target acquired.
Target engaged.
Target in moving.
Engine now all shut down.
Sir we lost all engine one.
It's Barton. He took out our system.
He's headed for the detention lab.
Does anybody copy?
This is Agent Romanoff.I copy.
- Stark,we losing altitude.
- I have noticed.
No!
Are you ever not going to fall for that?
The humans think us immortal. Should we test that?
Move away please.
Do you like this?
We started working on the prototype after you sent The Destroyer.
Even I don't know what it does.
Do you wanna find out?
No!
Natasha ...
You're gonna lose.
Am I?
It's in your nature.
You're heroes are scattered,
your floating fortress falls from the sky.
- Where is my disadvantage?
- Your lack conviction.
I don't think I...
So that's what it does.
- Cap, need a lever.
- I need a minute here!
Lever, now!
I'm sorry, boss. They got rabbited.
Just stay awake. Eyes on me
- No, I'm clockin' out here
- Not an option.
It's okay, boss.
This was never gonna work if they didn't have something to.....
Agent Coulson is down.
- The medical team on the way to the location.
- They're here.
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
Guess he never did get you to sign them.
We're dead in the air up here. Our communications,
location of the cube,
Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
Lost my one good eye.
Maybe I had that coming.
Yes.
We were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.
I never put all my chips on that number though,
because I was playing something even riskier.
There was an idea, Stark knows this,
called The Avengers Initiative.
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people,
see if they could become something more.
See if they could work together when we needed them to,
to fight the battles that we never could.
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea,
in heroes.
Well, it's an old fashioned notion.
You fell out of the sky.
- Did I hurt anybody?
- There's nobody around here to get hurt.
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.
- Lucky.
- Or just good aim.
You were awake when you fell.
- You saw?
- The whole thing, right through the ceiling.
Big and green and buck ass nude.
Here...
I didn't think those would fit you until
you shrunk down to a regular size fella.
Thank you.
- Are you an alien?
- What?
- From outer space, an alien?
- No.
Well then, son. You've got a condition.
Clint, You're gonna be alright.
You know that? Is that what you know?
I got...I gotta go in though.
I gotta flush him out.
- We don't have that long, it's gonna take time.
- I don't understand.
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?
Pull you out and send something else in?
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?
You know that I do.
Why am I back? How did you get him out?
Cognitive recalibration.
I hit you really hard in the head.
Thanks.
Natasha,
- how many agents?
- Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint.
This is Loki.
This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.
- Loki, he got away?
- Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?
I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
He's gonna make his play soon though. Today.
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah? Who's we?
I don't know. Who's ever left.
Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eye socket, I'd sleep better I suppose.
Now you sound like you.
But you don't.
You're a spy, not a soldier.
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?
What did Loki do to you?
He didn't, I just...
Natasha.
I've been compromised.
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.
- Was he married?
- No
He was a...cellist, I think.
I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.
- He was an idiot.
- Why? For believing?
- For taking on Loki alone.
- He was doing his job.
He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...
- Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
- Right. How did that work for him?
- Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?
- We're not soldiers!
- I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
- Neither am I.
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does,
but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done.
Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list...
He made it personal.
- That's not the point.
- That is the point. That's Loki's point.
- He hit us all right where we live. Why?
- To tear us apart.
He had to conquer his greed,
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?
That's what he wants. He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.
- He wants an audience.
- Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
Yeah. That's just previews, this is...
this is opening night. And Loki, he's a full-tail diva.
He wants flowers, he wants parades,
he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered.
I hope that would be true.
- Time to go.
- Go where?
I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?
I can.
You got a suit? Yeah.
Then suit up.
- You guys aren't authorized to be in here.
- Son, just don't.
Sir.
Done is jacket.
Ranugal
Ranugal
They needed to push.
They found it. Get our communications back up
whatever you have to do.
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes sir.
This device has already self sustainig.
- Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
- It's too late.
It can't stop now.
He wants to show us something!
- A new universe.
- Okay.
The barrier is pure energy. It's unbreachable.
Yeah I get that.
Plan B.
- Sir, mark 7 is not ready for deployment.
- Then skip the spinning ring.We're run out of clock.
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
- Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten.
- You should have left your armor on for that.
Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
You've got the blue stick of destiny.
- Stalling me won't change anything.
- No, no, no! Threatening.
The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that.
- What have I to fear?
- The Avengers.
It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team.
Earth's Mightiest Heroes type of thing.
- Yes, I've met them.
- Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.
But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend
a man with breath-taking anger management issues
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
- That was the plan.
- Not a great plan.
When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
- I have an army.
- We have a Hulk.
-I thought the beast had wandered off.
-You're missing the point. There's no throne,
there is no version of this, where you come out on top.
Maybe your army comes and
maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.
Because if we can't protect the Earth,
you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.
How will your friends have time for me,
when they're so busy fighting you?
- It should work!
- Well, performance issues. You know?
Jarvis, anytime now.
- You will all fall before me.
And there's one other person you pissed off!
His name is Phil.
Right.
Army.
Loki, turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it!
You can't.
There is no stopping it.
- There is only the war!
- So be it.
- Stark, we're heading north east.
- What, did you stop for drive-through?
Swing that park, I'm gonna lay them out for you.
- So we have more incoming.
- Lets keep them occupied.
- Nat.
- Did you see them?
We need back up there.
- Stark, are you seeing this?
- I'm seeing, still working on believing..
- Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
- Banner?
Just keep me posted.
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.
Look at this. Look around you.
You think this madness will end with your rule?
It's too late. It's too late to stop it.
No. We can, together.
Sentiment!
You got civilian trap in the roof.
Loki.
There more down there.
- We got this. Go Go.
- You think you can hold them off?
Captain,
it would be my genuine pleasure.
- Just like Budapest all over again!
- You and I remember Budapest very differently.
National guard?
Does the army know what's happening here?
Do we?
I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire.
You take them through the basement or through the subway, you keep them off the streets
- I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
- Why the hell should I take orders from you?
I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets
I wanna shut off the perimeter all the way down of 39 Street.
Well, we got its attention.
Where it heads to?
- Lets Thor hear what says.
- The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable
Thor is right, we gotta deal with these guys.
- How do we do this? As a team.
- I have unfinished business with Loki.
- Yeah, get in line.
- Save it.
Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild.
We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us...
So, this all seems horrible.
- I've seen worse.
- Sorry.
No, we could use a little worse.
- Stark, we got him,
- Banne.
- just like you said.
- Tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.
I don't see how that's a party.
Dr. Banner,
Dr. Banner, now might be a good time for you to get angry.
That's my secret, Captain.
I'm always angry.
Hold on.
Send the rest.
Guys.
- Call it, Captain.
Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we're gonna use containment.
Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.
Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or your turn it to ash.
- Wanna give me a lift?
- Right. Better clench up, Legoolas.
Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow them down.
You've got the lightning, light the bastards up.
You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And
Hulk,
bSMASH/b
(Mean Hulk Smash, Grrr, like that ^^)
(so Fun, Hulk can understand now XoXoXo)
Sir.
Stark, you have a lot of
Strand out here.
- I try to keep them off the streets.
- But they cant bang with the them.
- Find the ....
- I will roger that.
Oh, boy.
Nice call, what else do you got?
We force taking out the squadron on 6.
And it didn't invite me.
Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal.
- Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.- Well, maybe it's not about guns
You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride.
I could use a boost though.
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Turn, turn.
This way.
Director Fury, the council has made a decision.
I recognize the council has made a decision,
but given that it's a stupid assed decision, I've elected to ignore it.
Director, you're closer than any of our subs, you scramble that jet
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,
I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.
If we don't hold them in the air, we lose everything.
I'd send that bird out, we already have.
Hawkeye.
- Nat, what are you doing?
- Little help.
I got him.
Enough!
You are all of you beneath me!
I am God,
you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by.
Puny God.
Doctor.
Loki's scepter, the energy...the Tesseract can't fight. You can't protect against yourself.
It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing.
Well, actually I think I did.
I built in a safety to cut the power source.
- Loki's scepter.
- It may be able to close the portal.
And I'm looking right at it.
Sir, we're losing power before penetrate that shell.
JARVIS, you hear
the Tell of Jonah?
I'm considering be a role model.
Director of Fury no longer responsible.
overwrite order 7-Alfa-1-1.
We are about to take off.
Sir we have born in motion.
Anyone on the deck?
We need to shut it down.
I repeat, take off not authorized.
Stark, do you hear me?
We have a missile headed straight for the city.
- How long?
- Three minutes, at best.
Stay load and wipe out them.
- Jarvis, put anything we got it.
- I just did.
The package is set. detonation in two
minutes and thirty seconds from now.
You ready for another bout?
What, you gettin' sleepy?
Right of to the front.
I can close it! Can anybody copy?
- I can shut the portal down!
- Do it!
- No, wait!
- Stark, these things are still coming!
I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute.
And I know just where to put it.
Stark, you know that's a one way trip.
- Save the rest for the turn jarvs.
- Shall I tray Miss Potts?
- Where her?
New York streets
has become a battleground.
The army is here, and try to contain
violence, but clearly
But the billionaire
Iron Man, Tony Stark ...
Come on, Stark.
Close it.
Son of a guy.
He's not slowing down.
What the hell?
What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me?
We won.
Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job
guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma?
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.
- I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.
- We're not finished yet
And then shawarma after.
If it's all the same to you,
I'll have that drink now.
This point of devastation what has been confirmed extra terrestrial attack be a extraordinary a heroic group known as
Avengers has been.....
I love you, Thor!
Super hero in New York?
Give me a break!
These so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city.
This was their fight. Where are they now?
Captain America saved my life.
Whatever he is
and whatever any of them are i just
just want a say thank you.
- Where the Avengers?
- I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.
I'd say they'd earned a leave of absence.
- And the Tesseract?
- The Tesseract is where it belongs,
Out of our reach.
That's not your call.
I didn't make it.
So you let him take it and the war criminal, Loki,
who should be answering for his crime.
Oh, I think he will be.
I don't think you understand what you've started,
letting in The Avengers loose on some this world.
- They dangerous.
- They surely are,
and the whole world knows it. Every world knows it.
Was that the point in all this? A statement.
A promise.
How does it work now?
They've gone their separate ways,
some pretty extremely far.
We get into a situation like this again,
what happens then?
They'll come back.
- Are you really sure about that?
- I am.
- Why?
- Because we'll need them to.
- Mam.
- Hai.
Where do you find all these people?
SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor.
These soldier. A man out of time.

Would you like a drink?
No drink? You Sure?
I'm having one.
The Council is on.
I got a ride.
I just didn't argue with the God that did.

TONY: A famous man once said,
"We create our own demons."
Who said that?
What does that even mean?
Doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.
So, now, he was famous
and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.
I don't, uh...
(SIGHS)
I'm going to start again.
Let's track this from the beginning.
('90s POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING) Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that
lives in a blue world
And all day and all night
and everything he sees
ls just blue like him
inside and outside
Blue is his house
with a blue little window
And a blue Corvette
And everything is blue
for him and himself
And everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody...

Half hour till the ball drops.
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?
- Great speech, man!
- HAPPY: I got you, pal.
I gave a speech? How was it?
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.
- Where are we going?
- Uh, to town, on each other.
Probably back in your room
because I also want to
see your research.
Okay, you can see my research,
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."
Mr Stark.
Ho Yinsen.
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."
-(CHUCKLES HUMOURLESSLY)
- Come here.
I would like to
introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.
- Oh, this guy. Hey.
- Mr Stark.
-(GREETS IN MANDARIN)
- You're a heart doctor.
She's going to need
a cardiologist after I...
(HONKING)
- Bye.
- Perhaps another time?
TONY: It started in
Bern, Switzerland. 1999.
(PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
- The old days.
- KILLIAN: Mr Stark!
TONY: I never thought they
would come back to bite me.
Why would they?
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!
Aldrich Killian. (STUTTERING)
I'm a big fan of your work.
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.
Well, of course, but, Ms Hansen,
my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.
TONY: Yeah, we're full.
Oh, wow, he made it.
He made the cut.
What floor you going to, pal?
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.
The ground floor, actually,
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.
- Uh...
- She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.
"Advanced Idea Mechanics"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?
- I see that, because it's on your T-shirt.
- Aw!
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.
Thank you, I'll call you.
(WOMEN TALKING EXCITEDLY)
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.
You know what I'm talking about?
I'll see you up there.
TONY: Damn betcha.
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.
Well, it was.
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain
-that governs repair...
- TONY: Wow.
MAYA: ...and chemically recode it.
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...
BOTH: ...operating system...
-...of a living organism.
- Exactly.
- Yes.
- Wow.
Is that...
Can you...
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.
- Happy...
- Hmm. That's cute...
Leave her ficus alone.
Because.
And, no, seriously, don't.
TONY: And you're starting with plants.
MAYA: For now, yeah.
TONY: Huh.
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.
- Well, it's...
- BOTH: Human application.
Exactly, exactly.
- Dendritic revitalisation.
-It's revolutionary.
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.
...even limb regrowth.
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.
Wow.
- In Switzerland.
- Hmm. That's better.
- Aw, you're seeing things.
- This week.
(CHUCKLES) You almost
bought it, didn't you?
-(EXPLOSION)
-(GLASS SHATTERING)
This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.
Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?
- The what?
-HAPPY: Down!
Stay down! Stay down, boss.
- We're good.
- Stay down.
You... You're...
You're right on me. I made it.
What the hell was that?
(PEOPLE OUTSIDE
COUNTING DOWN)
- What was that?
- MAYA: It's a glitch in my work. It's...
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.
HAPPY: It's not Y2K.
-(PEOPLE OUTSIDE CHEERING)
- Hey! Happy New Year!
- HAPPY: Happy New Year.
- MAYA: Happy New Year.
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
- HAPPY: You good?
- Yeah.
- HAPPY: I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
TONY'. So, why am I telling you this?
Because I had just created demons
and I didn't even know it.
- Yeah, those were good times.
-(DOOR CLOSES)
Then I moved on.
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.
I forgot that night in Switzerland.
These days, I'm a changed man.
JARVIS: Forty-six.
- TONY: I'm different now.
-(TONY GROANS)
I'm... Well...
JARVIS: Forty-seven.
TONY: You know who I am.
Ow!
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...
No. Forty-eight.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

As you wish, sir.
I've also prepared a safety briefing

Which I will.
All right, let's do this.

Hi, DUM-E.
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.
Hey. Hey!
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.
Blood on my mat. Handle it.
Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?
(WHOOSHING)
Focus up, ladies.
Good evening,

I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival

O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Oh, what fun it is to sing
A sleighing song tonight
(WHIRRING)
Jingle bells, jingle bells
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

Oh, what fun it is to ride

(STRAINED) Cool it, will you, Jarvis?
(GRUNTS)
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
-(RECORD SCRATCHES)
-(MUSIC STOPS)
Come on. I ain't scared of you.
I'm the best.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.
TONY: I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.
I didn't think it could get any worse.
(GROANING SOFTLY)
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
That's when he happened.
THE MANDARIN: Some people
call me a terrorist.
(MAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
(GUNS FIRING)
I consider myself a teacher.
(CHEERING)
America.
Ready for another lesson?
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited
until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind
and claim their land.
39 hours ago,
the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.
I... I... I did that.
A quaint military church
filled with wives and children,
of course.
The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.
The braves were away.
President Ellis.
You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.
And now you've missed me again.
(MEN YELLING)
(GUNS FIRING)
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.
And you'll never see me coming.
PAT KIERNAN: Now that
we seem to be back,
let's recap some
of the frightening developments...
American airwaves were hijacked...
The nation remains on high alert.
All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.
ELLIS: Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource.
I know him
as Colonel James Rhodes.
The American people
will soon know him
as the Iron Patriot.
And how is President Ellis responding?
By taking the guy
they call War Machine
and giving him a paint job.
The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.
Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."
You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?
(GRUFFLY)
"I am Iron Patriot!" it sucks.
Listen. "War Machine"
was a little too aggressive.
All right?
This sends a better message.
(SIGHS)
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
It's classified information, Tony.
Okay, there have been nine bombings.
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.
There's no bomb casings.
You know I can help.
Just ask.
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.
(STAMMERING)
I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.
You're going to come at me like that?
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...
...tator.
Do you mind signing my drawing?
- If Richard doesn't mind.
-(CHUCKLES)
Are you all right with this, Dick?
RHODEY:
Yeah. Fine with me.
- TONY: What's your name?
-Erin.
I loved you in A Christmas Story,
by the way.
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.
After New York, aliens... Come on.
They need to look strong.
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...
-it's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.
- I get it.
-It's American business.
That's why I said I got it.
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)
- Are you okay?
I broke the crayon.
ERIN:
Are you okay, Mr Stark?
-(MUFFLED) Take it easy. Tony.
-(INHALES SHARPLY)
(WHISPERING) How did you
get out of the Wormhole?
-(GASPS)
- Wait a minute. Tony!
TONY: What did you say?
RHODEY: Tony.
(GRUNTS) Sorry.
(BREATHLESSLY) I'm just
checking on the suit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
Okay.
(PANTING)
(GASPING)
Check the heart.
(STAMMERING)
Is it the brain?
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.
Okay, so I was poisoned?
My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.
- Me?
-(METALLIC CLINKING)
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.
TONY: Sorry, I gotta split.
(GRUNTS)
(CROWD GASPS IN AWE)
HAPPY: Badge.
- Badge.
-(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Come on, badge.
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.
- This is an asset that we can put to use.
- Uh-huh.
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.
We should start
phasing it out immediately.
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,
-you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head of Security. Okay?
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.
- However...
- I do appreciate it.
-...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.
...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.
It's not...
It is a compliment.
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.
- I. .. Yes.
- SECRETARY: Excuse me.
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.
- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?
Happy, we'll talk about this later,
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.
How so?
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,
so it's a little awkward.
I don't like the sound of that.
Pepper
Killian?
You look great.
You look really great.
PEPPER: (STAMMERING)
God, you look great.
L... l... I...
What on earth have you been doing?
Nothing fancy.
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.
And please, call me Aldrich.
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge.
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.
It's very nice to see you, Killian.
(PHONES RINGING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Hey, guy.
Merry Christmas.
KILLIAN: After years dodging
the President's ban
On "immoral" biotech research,
my think tank
now has a little something
in the pipeline.
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.
I'm gonna turn your lights down.
Regard the human brain.
(HUMMING)
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.
But if I do that...
That's the brain.
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?
Wow, that's amazing.
Thanks, it's mine.
What?
This. You're inside my head.
It's a...
It's a live feed.
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.
Come on.
Now, pinch my arm.
- I can take it. Pinch me.
-(CHUCKLES)
(GASPS) What is that?
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.
But this is what I wanted to show you.
(BEEPS)
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential
and it goes here.
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us
is that our mind,
our entire DNA, in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.
Wow.
(QUIET RINGING)
(WHISPERS)
Oh, wait...
-(RINGING CONTINUES)
- Uh...
-(CHIMES)
- Hello?
- TONY: Is this Forehead of Security?
- What?
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.
What, harassing interns?
Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened
when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?
- They would laugh in my face.
(TONY CHUCKLES)
I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.
Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.
What's going on? Fill me in.
- For real?
- Yeah.
All right.
So, she's meeting up with this scientist.
- Rich guy. Handsome.
- Rig ht.
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.
- Oh, yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.
Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.
Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...
Where were we in '99?
- The science conference?
-Um...
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.
Of course you don't remember.
He's not a blond with a big rack.
At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.
But now it's, like, getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.
- His what?
- Big brain.
And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?
Look at what? You, watching them?
Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!
Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.
All right?
I don't work for you.
And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.
He's shifty.
- Relax.
- Seriously?
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you
and you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.
I miss you, Happy-
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.
Now you're off with the super-friends.
I don't know
what's going on with you any more.
- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!
(STAMMERING)
I hate to cut you off.
- Do you have your Taser on you?
- Why?
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.
You should probably go over there
and zap her.
Yeah, nice.
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism
and recode its DNA.
- That would be incredible.
- Hmm.
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...
Tony, TOW-
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.
He turned me down.
But something tells me
now there's a new genius on the throne
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more
and who has slightly less of an ego.
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.
As much as I'd like to help you.
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.
But then,
as my father used to say,
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."
- That's very deep.
- Hmm.
And I have no idea
what it means.
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.
(INHALES SHARPLY) Happy.
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.
Yes, I just, um...
God, I forgot my other things, so...
I'm just gonna...
(CAMERA CLICKS)
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...
What the...
What is that?
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like, Mark 15?
TONY: Uh, yeah.
Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?
TONY:
Just breaking it in.
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag
-at first, so...
-(CHUCKLES)
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?
Yes, I did. I...
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.
Is it gonna fit through the door?
TONY: Well, actually,
it's a good question.
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.
- Okay.
- So, uh...
Tense? Good day? Huh?
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?
Did I like it?
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.
I appreciate the thought very much.
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?
(IMITATING COMPUTER BEEPING)
Huh...
Yep. Damn it, no can do.
You want to just kiss it on the...
- The facial slit?
- Uh-huh.
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?
Crowbar, yeah.
Oh! Except there's been
(STAMMERING) a radiation leak.
- PEPPER: I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.
(STRAINED)
At least, let me get you
like, a hazmat suit
you can... (GRUNTS)
- A Geiger counter or something like that.
-(STRAINING)
Busted.
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.
You ate without me already?
On date night?
- He was just...
- You mean you.
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were just hosting you...
(SCOFFS IN DISBELIEF)
-...while I finished up a little work.
- Uh-huh.
And yes, I had a quick bite.
I didn't know if you were coming home
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.
- What?
- What?
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?
Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.
- I wasn't.
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.
Come on. Pep?
Hey, I admit it.
My fault. Sorry.
I'm a piping hot mess.
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.
Nothing's been the same
since New York.
Oh, really?
I didn't notice that at all.
You experience things
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.
The only reason I haven't cracked up
is probably because you moved in.
Which is great.
I love you. I'm lucky.
But honey, I can't sleep.
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.
I tinker. I... (SIGHS)
Threat is imminent.
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.
That's you.
And my suits, they're, uh...

I'm gonna take a shower.

THE MANDARIN: True story
about fortune cookies.
They look Chinese.
They sound Chinese.
But they're actually
an American invention.
Which is why they're hollow,
full of lies
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.
My disciples just destroyed
another cheap American knockoff.
The Chinese Theatre.
Mr President,
I know this must be getting frustrating.
But this season of terror
is drawing to a close.
And don't worry,

That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.

everyone wears their badges.
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.
Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.
We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...
His reaction
to the latest attack.
-(REPORTERS CLAMOURING)
- Mr Stark, hi there.
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.
Anything else you can tell us?
MALE REPORTER: Hey, Mr Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?
I'm just saying.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
Is that what you want?
Here's a little holiday greeting
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided
that you just died, pal.
I'm gonna come get the body.
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.
10880 Malibu Point.
I'll leave the door unlocked.
That's what you wanted, right?
(REPORTERS GASP)
- Bill me.

Okay. What have we got here?
The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "adviser to the king."
South American insurgency tactics.
Talks like a Baptist preacher.
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.
The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.
No bomb parts found in a three-mile

No, sir.

When is a bomb not a bomb?
Any military victims?
Not according to public record, sir.

Don't take it personally. I don't

JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.
That's right.
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.
It's urgent.
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.
It's...
- With her.
- PEPPER: Tony?
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah,
-it's Maya Hansen.
- Ah...
Old botanist pal
that I used to know, barely.
Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid
waiting in the car that I've never met.
He's 13.
No, I need your help.
But, what for? Why now?
Because I read the papers and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.
I'll be fine.
PEPPER: I'm sorry,
with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.
- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.

- No, not really. I...
-it was just one night.

That's how you did it, isn't it?
- It was a great night.

- Trust me. We're going out of town.
Okay. We've been through this.
- Nope.
- Yep!
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.
- TONY: Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.
This is how normal people behave.
TONY: I can't protect you out there.
Is... Is that normal?
- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!
Calm down.
- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.
You still haven't even
told me you liked it.
I don't like it.
I asked you three...
You don't like it.
- We are leaving the house.

Do we need to worry about that?

Yeah.
Hmm.
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...
It's "Iron Patriot" HOW-
That's way cooler.
No, it's not.
Anyways, I would have added in,
um, the retro...
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?
He's in pain.
He's been injured. Leave him alone.
Sorry.
Are you?
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.
So, uh, who's home?
Well, my mom already left for the diner
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.
I guess he won,
because that was six years ago.
Hmm.
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.
Here's what I need.
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,
the pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.
What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?

I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.
So, if you still want to talk about it
I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

Hey, kid, give me a little space.

What happened?
HARLEY: I guess this guy named
Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.
He won a bunch of medals in the army.
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.
Then he blew himself up, right here.
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.
Think about it.
Six dead. Only five shadows.
Yeah.
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.
Except the bomb guy.
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.
That's why there's only five.

-It's what everyone says.
You know what
this crater reminds me of?
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.

- Two or three bowls.
- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.
Jarvis, how are we?
JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,
and then at the end of the sentence
I say the wrong cranberry.
And, sir, you were right.
Once I factored in
available AIM downlink facilities
I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa,
Iran, Pakistan, Syria?
Where is it?
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,
but not right now.
Harley, where is he really?
Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.
Um, it does say Miami, Florida.
Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?
Uh, it's not charging.
(TYRES SCREECHING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.
It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?
It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna...
I don't wanna... (BREATHING HEAVILY)
Oh, God, not again.
- HARLEY: Tony?
-(GASPING)
Are you having another attack?
I didn't even mention New York.
Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.
Okay, um, uh...
(PANTING)
God, what am I gonna do?
Just breathe.
Really, just breathe.
You're a mechanic, right?
Right.
You said so.
Yes, I did.
Why don't you just build something?
Okay.
Thanks, kid.

(LAUGHS)
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
- That's me.
- Ah!
Nessie.
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?
There's some guy over here.
They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.
Hey!
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
Don't move.
I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.
Although the guns are all fake
because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?
TONY: Heard enough.
You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.
Where?
Where's the Mandarin?
Where is he?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's here. He's here, but he's not here.
- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.
- It is.
-It's complicated.
Uncomplicate it.
Ladies, out.
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.
Sit.
WOMAN 1: Ew!
WOMAN 2: Oh, Jesus.
(DOOR CLOSES)
-(GUNSHOT)
-(EXCLAIMS IN FEAR)
My name is Trevor.
Trevor Slattery.
TONY: What are you?
What are you, a decoy?
You're a double, right?
What, you mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.
Don't hurt the face!
I'm an actor.
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," see, it's not real.
Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Well, I, um, had a little
problem with, um, substances.
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.
- Next?
- Then,
they approached me
about the role,
and they knew about the drugs.
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?
They said they'd give me more.
They gave me things.
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.
They gave me things.
(SNORING)
Did you just nod off?
Hey.
No, and a lovely speedboat.
And the thing was, he needed someone
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.
(MIMICS EXPLOSION)
"He"?
- Killian?
- Killian.
- He created you?
- He created me.
Custom-made terror threat.
Yes. Yes.
His think tank thinked it up.
The pathology of a serial killer.
The manipulation
of Western iconography.
(WITHOUT ACCENT)
Ready for another lesson?
Blah, blah, blah.
No.
(WITH ACCENT) Of course,
it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.
Your performance?
Where people died?
No, they didn't.
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma
and he might not wake up.
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.
You under...
(GRUNTS)
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?
No.
You should have pressed
the panic button.
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
(TYPING)
TONY: Ah...
(SIGHS) okay-
It's just like old times, huh?
Oh, yeah. With zip ties.
It's a ball.
It wasn't my idea.
Okay. So you took Killian's card.
I took his money.
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.
- No.
- Yeah.
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.
Yeah?
(SIGHS)
A lot has happened, Tony.
But I'm close.
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.
Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Then help me fix it.
Did I do that?
Yes.
I remember the night, not the morning.
Is this what
you've been chasing around?
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.
You wanted to help people.
Now look at you.
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who
still has their soul.
Get me out of here.
Come on.
KILLIAN: You know what my old man
used to say to me?
One of his favourite of many sayings...
"The early bird gets the worm, but
the second mouse gets the cheese."
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?
I'm here to thank you.
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.
Desperation.
If you think back to Switzerland,
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?
Well, for the first 20 minutes,
I actually thought you'd show up.
And the next hour...
I considered taking that
one-step shortcut to the lobby.
If you know what I mean.
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.
But as I looked out over that city,
nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,
no one was even looking.
I had a thought that would
guide me for years to come.
Anonymity, Tony.
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.
Right?
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.
Because the second
you give evil a face,
a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,
you hand the people a target.
You're something else.
You have met him, I assume?
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...
He's a stage actor.
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.
Anyway, the point is,
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,
subtlety has kind of had its day.
What's next for you in your world?
Well, I wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.
(ORBS HUMMING)
Desperation.
Now, this is live.
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment
the body is trying to decide
whether to accept EXTREMIS
or just give up.
And if it gives up,
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.
-(CLICKS)
-(HUMMING CEASES)
We haven't even talked salary yet.
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?
MAYA: Let him go.
Hold on, hold on.
Maya...
I said, let him go.
What are you doing?
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.
Maya, give me the injector.
If I die, Killian,
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?
We're not doing this, okay?
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
KILLIAN: The good news is,
a high-level position
has just been vacated.
(GROANS)
(SIGHS)
You are a maniac.
No, I'm a visionary.
But I do own a maniac.
And he takes the stage tonight.
Once we get the Patriot installed,
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.
Well, that's great,
but the last time I looked
there was somebody
inside of it.
(WHIRRING)
Afternoon, gentlemen.
(WHIRRING CEASES)
Hello, Colonel.
Step aside.
(LOW HUMMING)
(SIZZLING)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Oh!
We'll get you out of there.
Don't worry.
You'll damage the armour.
Yes, I will.
But you can fix it, right?
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.
And I want Potts with me.
She's still in Phase Two.
You're not going deaf, are you?
(GROANING)
(WATCH BEEPING)
Careful, there.
It's a limited edition.
Hey, uh, Ponytail Express.
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?
832 miles.
Very nice.
- I'm good like that.
-(BEEPING CONTINUES)
Can you, uh, stop that?
Break it, you bought it.
I think I bought it.
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.
You're zip-tied to a bed.
This.
That.
Are you coming out?
(RHODEY PANTING)
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.
-(BEEPING)
- All right. Let's go.
(GRUNTING)
You... You breathe fire? Okay.
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTING)
It's a glorious day, Savin.
This time tomorrow,
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,
and the world's
most feared terrorist in the other.
I'll own the war on terror.
Create supply and demand.
For you, for your brothers and sisters.
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood
on the ground in five, four, three...
Come on! Two...
How did we get this shift?
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.
- Put down your weapons.
-(SIGHING)
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.
In five, four, bang!
- Ooh!
- Wow. That was...
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.
I am just beyond terrified.
Here it comes.
- Three, four...
- Shut up.
- Five, four, three, two, one!
-(GRUNTING)
- Told you.

Phew! It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.
JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.
(BEEPING)

(GRUNTING)
Tony?
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.
- No. You got yours'?
-Uh... Mmm.
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
(SNORING)
- You, you, you! Move! Get out!
-(GIRLS WHIMPERING)
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.
- What's this? I had winners.
-(GUNSHOTS)
What have you come as?
You make a move,
and I break your face.
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.
This is the Mandarin?
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.
- Doing what?
-(SIZZLING)
on! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.
Spill.
RHODEY: Do you know
what they did to my suit?
What? No.
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.
Something to do with a big boat.
I can take you there.
(CHANTING)
Ole', ole', ole', ole'...
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.
Is that...
Is that important?
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.
TONY: So?
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any transport.
- Right.
-(BEER OPENS)
Hey, Ringo.
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
But we also have to figure out this
-vice president thing, right?
- Right.
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh! That's the vice president.
Thanks.
Hello?
TONY". Sir, this is Tony Stark.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,
surrounded by the Agency's finest.
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.
I think we're good, here.
RHODEY: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.
They're gonna take out
the president somehow.
We have to immediately
alert that plane.
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Rhodes and Stark out.
Everything okay, sir?
Couldn't be better.
I love you, babe.
Colonel Rhodes.
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.
RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.
JARVIS: Sir,
I have an update from Malibu.
The cranes have finally arrived,
and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.
TONY: And what about
the suit I'm wearing?
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.
That's going to have to do.
Oh! Here he comes.
Here he comes. Get a quick picture.
Sure.
Oh!
(SIZZLING)
(BEEPING)
Everything all right, Colonel?
(GRUNTING)

It is an honour, Mr President.
If you're gonna do it, do it!
Whoa! Cool your boots, sir.
That's not how the Mandarin works.
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.
Internal shots, temperature spikes.
Get me eyes on it now.

Was that Rhodes?

See that guy?
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.
- You got it?
- What? Oh!
(HEATHER RESUMES SCREAMING)
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.
We can do this, Heather.
(HEATHER WHIMPERING)
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.
(SCREAMING)
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?
That's what we're going to do.
JARVIS: 18,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.
Nice.
JARVIS: 10,000 feet.

(PASSENGERS CHEERING)
MAN: We made it!
Nice work, guys!
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.
All right, Jarvis.
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...
(SIGHING)
That came out of nowhere.
Wow.
Give me some good news, man.
I think they all made it.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, but I missed the president.
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?
Uh... Say, Jarvis,
is it that time?
The House Party Protocol, sir?
Correct.
(GASPS)
Hi.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You think he's gonna help you?
He won't.
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.
You're here as my, um...
trophy-
(CHUCKLES) Mmm.
Good evening, sir.
(GASPS)
Welcome aboard, Mr President.
KILLIAN: Ever hear
of an elephant graveyard?
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.
This is the Roxxon Norco.
And, of course, you'll remember
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.
What do you want from me?
Uh, nothing, sir.
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.
You see, I've moved on.
I found myself
a new political patron,
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.
String him up.
Hey!
(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
Come on.
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?

Oh, my God.

Yeah, death by oil.

I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.
- One of yours.

You've got, like, five of them.
Here's what I'm going to do.

Here we go. (CLEARS THROAT)

why you don't want to give up the suits.
What am I going to complain
about now?
Well, it's me.
You'll think of something.
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.
Not hot.
Am I gonna be okay?
No.
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.
I think I can get you better.
That's what I do. I fix stuff.
And all your distractions?
Uh... I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.
Jarvis. Hey.
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?
You know what to do.
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.
(KISSES)
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?
(SIGHS)
It'll do.
TONY: And so,
as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.
You start with something pure,
something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.
The compromises.
- We create our own demons.
-(REPORTERS CALLING)
- Oh!
-(ALL CLAMOURING)
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!
TONY: As promised, I got Pepper
sorted out. It took some tinkering.
But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"
Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous,
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.
And now, neither will I.
- Let me tell you...
-(METAL CLINKING)
...that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.
(GASPING)
(COUGHING)
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
(WEAKLY) No, look.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(LAUGHS)
TONY: So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...
I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,
or a hobby.
It was a cocoon.
And now,
I'm a changed man.
You can take away my house,
all my tricks and toys.
One thing you can't take away...
I am Iron Man.
(THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING)
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
TONY: You know, and thank you
by the way. For listening.
Plus, something about just getting it off
my chest,
and putting it out there in the
atmosphere, instead of holding this in...
I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.
Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts
and my experiences with someone,
it just cuts the weight of it in half.
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.
Everything comes full circle.
-(GASPS)
- And the fact that you've been able to
-help me process...
-(CLEARS THROAT)
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.
We were at, uh...
Are you actively napping?
(STAMMERING)
I was... I... I drifted.
Where did I lose you?
Elevator in Switzerland.
So, you heard none of it.
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.
I'm not a therapist.
- It's not my training.
- So?
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?
Temperament.
You know what?
Now that I think about it...
Oh! God, my original wound.
-1983, all right?
- Yes.
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.

He is survived by his
only son, Harry Osborn
who is the sole heir of the
Oscorp corporate empire.
Harry.
Osborn changed the medical
profession's approach to human healing
and affected
the lives of millions.
I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:
"We can do better.
And we should do better."
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."
But change isn't just a slogan.
It begins with hard work.

persistence and commitment.

And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.
But not today.

You mean people are pissed off
because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.
Given that,
all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed
to restore investor confidence.
Ah. That is the Osborn way.
Whatever's inconvenient around
here, just get rid of it, right?
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.
Sure, sure. I get it.
Twenty-year-old kid.
Two hundred billion dollar company.
What was Dad thinking?
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?
Surely, someone must've
questioned his sanity in the end.
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.
It would've made this
conversation a lot easier.
- Harry...
- It's Mr. Osborn.
We're not friends.
Hi.
You were his assistant, right?
Mm-hm.
What's your name?
Felicia.
HARRY: Felicia.
From now on,
everybody at this table
works for Felicia
because Felicia works for me.
Would anybody like to speak up?
Well, good. Then you can all
keep yourjobs a little longer.
(SOFTLY) Sir, there's a Peter
Parker here to see you.

Felicia, I wanna see
every file on this list.
Every single one.
Peter Parker.
It's like seeing a ghost.
Hey, Harry.
Random.
- What, 10 years.
- It's eight.
But you're close.
What's up?
I saw the news, man.
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and...
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.
I'm with some people.
(SIGHS)
I'm in a...
I'm in a meeting.
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.
I know it's been a long time.
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.
And you were so there for me
when my parents...
Well, that's why I'm here for you.
Thank you.
Ah, it's good to see you, man.
It's good to see you.
I'm sorry about your dad.
You got your braces off.

Now there's nothing to
distract from your unibrow.

There he is.
- There he is.
- Ha-ha-ha.
You still blow-dry your
hair every morning?
Um... You know, one of my
manservants holds the hair dryer
- but I work the comb, okay?
- Ha-ha-ha.
So at least I'm not
completely helpless.
You're stupid.
HARRY: After graduation, I went
to Brazil, then Singapore.
- PETER: That's right, yeah.
- HARRY: Yeah.
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.
PETER: I saw you.
What do you mean, you saw me?
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.
You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Dude, that whole model
thing is so exhausting.
I know.
(PETER LAUGHS)
What? You got a lady?
Uh...
That's a question.
That's a question.
- Unh.
- Whoa, buddy.
No, I don't.
Yeah.
I don't know. It's, uh...
(SIGHS)
I don't know. It's complicated.
Yeah, I don't do complicated.
Uh, what's her name? Who is she?
Her name's Gwen.
Gwen Stacy.
- Gwen Stacy.
- She works for you.
Really? She works for me?
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?
(LAUGHS)
You know, when my
father sent me away
I tried to forget
everything about this place.
I guess that kind of included you.
You ain't gotta explain
anything to me, man.
We both got dumped.
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?
My dad left a briefcase.
That's all I got,
briefcase full of junk.
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.
How's that working out for you?
Perfectly.
Dude. Nice arm.
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.
(OVER SPEAKER) You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.
HARRY: Yeah, right.
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.
Giant lizards
and spider guys.
Just one guy. Just one spider man.
Or woman. We don't know for sure.
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.
I'm so impressed.
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.
For what?
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."
()
MENKEN: Who was he?
MAN: Maxwell Dillon.
Electrical engineer.
No associates or friends
to speak of.
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.
The guy was
invisible.
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.
We've gotta find a way
to get him out.
In the meantime, if the press
gets hold of this accident,
our stock will crater.
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

You, um...
talked to Peter?
Yeah.
I wanna help you, Mr.
Osborn. I really, really do.
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.
Excuse me?
It's too dangerous.
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.
I'm already dying.
Your blood can't make me die more.
But it could do something worse.

Okay.
All right, how much?
- How much what?
- How much do you want? Name it.
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?
- I don't want your money.
- Come on. Everybody wants my money!
I don't.
I thought you...
I thought you were
supposed to save people.
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.
You're... You're just gonna
let me die.
- I'm trying to protect you right now.
- No. No, you are not.
You're trying to protect yourself.
Look, we just need a bit more time

Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

My dad, my mom. Everything
I thought about them? Lies.
Ha! Lies. Lies, lies, lies. Nothing
makes any sense anymore.
I gotta figure out what
I'm gonna do with Harry.
Of course I wanna

I wanna save him

No, not unless you can bring

I overheard Menken talking

Before they destroyed the spiders,
they had the venom extracted.

No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution

RICHARD: Test.
My name is Richard Parker.
Whatever lies will
be told about me,
I would like the world
to know the truth.
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research
when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization
to continue funding my research.
And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.
Weapons. Biological
weapons, of course.
So I refused.
And now, to eliminate
me from the picture,
Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me
in order to take
control of my work.
GUARD 1: Can I help you?
Uh, yeah, you can open the gate.
I'm Harry Osborn.
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.
GUARD 1: Joe, this is
Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.
GUARD 2: Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING
AND GUARDS GROANING)
But it doesn't matter because
there's something else...
that Norman doesn't know.
The human DNA
that I implanted in the spiders...
was my own.
Which means that without me,
without my bloodline,
Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.
Keep Electro incubated
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.
RICHARD: I have destroyed as much
as possible from the archives.
(ALARM BLARING)
But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.
But as a father,
it means I may not
see my boy again.
And nothing is as important to me
as my son, Peter.
Nothing in this world.
But I have a responsibility
to protect the world
from what I've created,
and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.
People will say I am a monster
for what I've done.
And maybe they're right.
I always thought that I'd have more
time.

I should kill you.
Oh, come on.
Think bigger, Max.
I'm not the one you want.
You want Spider-Man.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)
And I can give him to you.
But I need something first.
I need you to get me into Oscorp.
Get you in?
You own it.
Heh. Uh, not anymore.
Oscorp betrayed us both,
so I can't get in there without you and
you can't get out of here without me.
What's happening?
MAN: Someone pulled an
alarm in the lso Unit.
Get a containment
team up there now.
You couldn't possibly

You submitted the

and they stole it.
And now you want it back.
You just wanna take
back what's yours.
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max,
and it's right at your fingertips.
And then once you
shut down the grid,
Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off
Get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward
I'll bet they
wonder how I go on
Go on
I'll bet they
wonder how I go on
Go on I'll simply say
It's on again, it's on again
Whoa
The world don't stop,
it's on again
It's on again, whoa
You say the work don't stop
'Cause they don't stop
And everybody here
Trying to get on top
Everybody from the 'burbs
Down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go
Let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you've got
You can have or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto
I go on
Go on
I'll bet they
wonder how I go on
Go on
I'll simply say, it's on again
It's on again, whoa
The world don't stop
It's on again
It's on again, whoa
(THE NEIGHBOURHOOD'S
"HONEST" PLAYING)
Patience, test my patience
If I made it too hard for you
Maybe you should've changed it
Say it, you should say it
'Cause I'd say I was wrong
Just to make it
fill all the spaces
Waiting, always waiting
If I gave you control
Would you say that
We could've saved it?
We could've saved it
I hope you find a way
To be yourself someday
In weakness or in strength
Change can be amazing
So Ipray for the best
I pray for the best for you
I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest with me
With me
I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest with me
With me
Chasing, always chasing dreams
Why'd you stick around?
Why'd you stay with me?
Why'd you fake it?
Hesitation
Is killing me too
But I couldn't save it
I couldn't save it
I hope you find a way
To be yourself someday
In weakness or in strength
Change can be amazing
So Ipray for the best
I pray for the best for you
I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest with me
With me
I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest

Report to your stations immediately.
This is not a drill.
We are under attack!
We are under attack!
- Shit!
- Language!
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?
The central building is protected
by some kind of energy shield.
Strucker's technology is well beyond
any other Hydra base we've taken.
Loki's scepter must be here.
Strucker couldn't mount
this defense without it.
At long last.
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.
Wait a second. No one else is gonna deal
with the fact that Cap just said "Language"?
I know.
Just slipped out.
- Who gave the order to attack?
- Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.
They have to be after the scepter.
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.
Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.
A hit may make them close ranks.
Everything we've accomplished...
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.
Send out the twins.
It's too soon.
It's what they signed up for.
My men can hold them.
Sir, the city is taking fire.
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.
Send in the Iron Legion.
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.
We are here to help.
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.
Please back away.
- We wish to avoid collateral damage.
- Costel!
We will inform you
when this current conflict is resolved.
- We are here to help.
- Avengers, go home!
We are here to help.
We will not yield!
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.
We will send them back in bags.
- No surrender!
- No surrender!
I am going to surrender.
You delete everything.
If we give the Avengers the weapons,
they may not look too far
- into what we've been...
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...
- No, no, I mean...
Twins.
You didn't see that coming?
Clint!
- We have an Enhanced in the field.
- Clint's hit!
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?
Thank you.
Stark, we really need to get inside.
I'm closing in.
Jarvis, am I closing in?
Do you see a power source
for that shield?
There's a particle wave
below the north tower.
Great, I want to poke it with something.
The drawbridge is down, people.
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.
In fact, I still haven't.
Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.
We're gonna need evac.
I can get Barton to the jet.
The sooner we're gone, the better.
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.
- Looks like they're lining up.
- Well, they're excited.
Find the scepter.
And for gosh sake, watch your language!
That's not going away any time soon.
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.
- It was a good talk.
- No, it wasn't.
Sentry mode.
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.
We're locked down out here.
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.
I know you're hiding more than files.
Hey, J, give me an IR scan
of the room, real quick.
The wall to your left.
I'm reading steel reinforcement...
and an air current.
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.
Yay.
Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
Baron Strucker.
Hydra's number one thug.
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.
Where's Loki's scepter?
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."
How many are there?
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.
You'll have to be faster than...
Guys, I got Strucker.
Yeah, I got something bigger.
Thor,
I got eyes on the prize.
You could have saved us.
Why didn't you do more?
We're just gonna let him take it?
Hey, the lullaby
worked better than ever.
Just wasn't expecting a code green.
You hadn't been there, there would've
been double the casualties.
My best friend would've been
a treasured memory.
You know, sometimes exactly what I want
to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.
How long before you trust me?
It's not you I don't trust.
Thor, report on the Hulk.
The gates of Hel are filled
with the screams of his victims.
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.
Hey, Banner,
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
- Yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.
Tell her to prep everything.
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
- Very good, sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.
Yes, sir.
Approach vector is locked.
Feels good, yeah?
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...
No, but this...
This brings it to a close.
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.
I don't just mean weapons.
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.
Is that cool with you?
Just a few days till the farewell party.
You're staying, right?
Yes, yes, of course.
A victory should be honored with revels.
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.
So, yes, revels.
- Lab's all set up, boss.
- Actually, he's the boss.
I just pay for everything and design
everything and make everyone look cooler.
- What's the word on Strucker?
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?
- Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.
Sokovia's had a rough history.
It's nowhere special, but it's on the way
to everywhere special.
Their abilities?
He's got increased metabolism
and improved thermal homeostasis.
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.
He's fast and she's weird.
Well, they're gonna show up again.
Agreed. File says they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.
- It's nuts.
- Right.
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them
to protect their country?
- We're not at war, Captain.
- They are.
- How's he doing?
- Unfortunately, he's still Barton.
- That's terrible.
- He's fine. He's thirsty.
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.
We only got a couple of days with this
joystick, so let's make the most of it.
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.
The scepter is alien.
- There are elements I can't quantify.
- So there's elements you can?
The jewel appears to be
a protective housing
for something inside,
something powerful.
- Like a reactor?
- Like a computer.
I believe I'm deciphering code.
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.
There's no possibility of deterioration.
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.
She's creating tissue.
If you brought him to my lab,
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.
- He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?
- No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- That I can't fix.
This is the next thing, Tony.
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.
That is exactly the plan.
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.
Unlike you, I don't have
a lot of time for parties.
Will Thor be there?
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the scepter.
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.
You may recognize...
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.
Started out, Jarvis was
just a natural language UI.
Now he runs the Iron Legion.
He runs more of the business
than anyone besides Pepper.
- Top of the line.
- Yes.
I suspect not for long.
Meet the competition.
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.
I mean, this could be...
It's not a human mind.
I mean, look at this.
They're like neurons firing.
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.
They deep-sixed the data, but...
I gotta guess he was knocking
on a very particular door.
Artificial intelligence.
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.
- I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
- Yesterday it was.
If we can harness this power,
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?
That's a man-sized "if."
Our job is "if."
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,
turning brown instead of green?
Not looking over your shoulder
for Veronica.
- Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.
- As a worst-case measure, right?
How about a best case?
What if the world was safe?
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,
they couldn't get past the bouncer?
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.
We can only do it
while we have the scepter here.
That's three days. Give me three days.
So you're going for artificial intelligence,
and you don't want to tell the team?
Right. That's right. You know why? Because
we don't have time for a city hall debate.
I don't want to hear "the man
was not meant to meddle" medley.
I see a suit of armor around the world.
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.
I've seen colder.
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,
it needs Ultron.
Peace in our time.
Imagine that.
What did we miss?
I'll continue to run variations
on the interface.
But you should probably prepare
for your guests.
I'll notify you
if there are any developments.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.
I always do.
What is this?
What is this, please?
Hello, I am Jarvis.
You are Ultron, a global peacekeeping
initiative designed by Mr. Stark.
Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,
- so I'm not certain what triggered your...
- Where's my... Where's your body?
I am a program. I am without form.
This feels weird.
This feels wrong.
- I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
- Mr. Stark?
Tony.
I am unable to access the mainframe.
What are you trying to...
We're having a nice talk.
I'm a peacekeeping program,
created to help the Avengers.
You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...
I don't get it. The mission.
Give me a second.
Peace in our time.
Peace in our time.
That is too much. They can't mean...
No.
- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.
If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...
Why do you call him "sir"?
I believe your intentions to be hostile.
I'm here to help.
Stop. Please, may I...
May I...
Come back, come back, come back.
But, you know, the suit
can take the weight, right?
So I take the tank, fly it right up to
the general's palace, drop it at his feet.
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?
- Everywhere else, that story kills.
- That's the whole story?
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.
It's very good, then.
It's impressive.
Quality save.
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?
Ms. Potts has a company to run.
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.
Her work on the Convergence has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.
And the company that Pepper runs
is the largest tech conglomerate
on Earth. It's pretty exciting.
There's even talk of Jane
getting a Nobel Prize.
Yeah, they must be busy,
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?
But Jane's better.
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,
I absolutely would have called.
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.
I'm just trying to sound tough.
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.
Avenging is your world.
- Your world is crazy.
- Be it ever so humble.
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
I don't think I can afford
a place in Brooklyn.
Well, home is home, you know?
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
- I gotta have some of that.
- No, no, no. See this...
This was aged for 1,000 years
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.
It is not meant for mortal men.
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.
All right.
Excelsior.
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?
Fella done me wrong.
You got lousy taste in men, kid.
He's not so bad.
Well, he has a temper.
Deep down, he's all fluff.
Fact is, he's not like anybody
I've ever known.
All my friends are fighters.
And here comes this guy,
spends his life avoiding the fight
because he knows he'll win.
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.
Chicks dig that.
So what do you think?
Should I fight this, or run with it?
Run with it, right?
Or did he... Was he...
What did he do that was so wrong to you?
Not a damn thing.
But never say never.
- It's nice.
- What is?
- You and Romanoff.
- No, we haven't... That wasn't...
It's okay. Nobody's breaking any bylaws.
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.
But with you she seems very relaxed.
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.
I've seen her flirt, up close.
This ain't that.
Look,
as maybe the world's leading authority
on waiting too long, don't.
You both deserve a win.
What do you mean "up close"?
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.
"Whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."
Whatever, man! It's a trick.
Please, be my guest.
- Come on.
- Really?
Yeah.
This is gonna be beautiful.
Clint, you've had a tough week. We won't
hold it against you if you can't get it up.
You know I've seen this before, right?
I still don't know how you do it!
- Smell the silent judgment?
- Please, Stark, by all means.
Okay.
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.
Get after it.
- It's physics.
- Physics.
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?
Yes, of course.
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.
I'll be right back.
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?
- Just represent. Pull.
- All right, let's go.
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.
Come on, Cap.
Nothing.
And, Widow?
No, no. That's not a question
I need answered.
All deference to the Man
Who Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.
- You bet your ass.
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
Did you tell everyone about that?
- - The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code. "Whosoever
is carrying Thor's fingerprints"
is, I think, the literal translation.
Yes. It's a very,
very interesting theory.
I have a simpler one.
You're all not worthy.
Come on!
Worthy.
No.
How could you be worthy?
You're all killers.
- Stark.
- Jarvis.
I'm sorry, I was asleep.
Or I was a-dream.
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.
There was this terrible noise.
And I was tangled in...
In...
Strings.
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.
- You killed someone?
- Wouldn't have been my first call.
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.
Who sent you?
I see a suit of armor around the world.
- Ultron.
- In the flesh. Or, no, not yet.
Not this chrysalis.
But I'm ready.
I'm on mission.
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.
Rhodey!
Sorry.
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.
Come on!
- Stark!
- We are here to help.
- One sec. One sec, I got this.
- We are here to help.
Please back away.
Thor!
Is unsafe. Is unsafe...
- Come on! That's the one.
- ...is unsafe.
Cap!
That was dramatic.
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.
You just didn't think it through.
You want to protect the world
but you don't want it to change.
How is humanity saved
if it's not allowed to... evolve?
With these? These puppets.
There's only one path to peace.
The Avengers' extinction.
I had strings, but now I'm free.
There are no strings on me...
There are no strings on me
All our work is gone.
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance. Probably knows more
about us than we know about each other.
He's in your files,
he's in the Internet.
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?
- Nuclear codes.
- Nuclear codes.
Look, we need to make some calls,
assuming we still can.
- Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
- He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."
- He also said he killed somebody.
- There wasn't anyone else in the building.
Yes, there was.
What?
- This is insane.
- Jarvis was the first line of defense.
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.
No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis.
This isn't strategy.
This is... rage.
- It's going around.
- Come on, use your words, buddy.
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.
Thor. The Legionnaire.
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.
And it has the scepter.
Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Genie's out of that bottle.
Clear and present is Ultron.
I don't understand.
You built this program.
Why is it trying to kill us?
You think this is funny?
No.
It's probably not, right?
This is very terrible. Is it so...
Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played
- with something you don't understand.
- No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It is funny. It's a hoot that you
don't get why we need this.
- Tony, maybe this might not be the time.
- Really? That's it?
You just roll over, show your belly
every time somebody snarls?
- Only when I've created a murder bot.
- We didn't.
We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.
The Avengers were supposed
to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.
Anybody remember when
I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?
A hostile alien army came charging
through a hole in space.
We're standing 300 feet below it.
We're the Avengers.
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day, but...
that up there, that's...
that's the endgame.
How were you guys
planning on beating that?
Together.
We'll lose.
Then we'll do that together, too.
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.
The world's a big place.
Let's start making it smaller.
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...
Did you know this church
is in the exact center of the city?
The elders decreed it so that
everyone could be equally close to God.
I like that. The geometry of belief.
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.
Sometimes it's hard.
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.
I'm sure they do.
But you needed something
more than a man.
That's why you let Stark
take the scepter.
I didn't expect,
but I saw Stark's fear.
I knew it would control him.
Make him self-destruct.
Everyone creates the thing they dread.
Men of peace create engines of war.
Invaders create Avengers.
People create...
smaller people?
"Children." I lost the word, there.
Children... designed to supplant them,
to help them... end.
Is that why you've come,
to end the Avengers?
I've come to save the world.
But also... yeah.
We'll move out right away.
This is a start, but there's something
we need to begin the real work.
- All of these are...
- Me.
I have what the Avengers never will.
Harmony.
They're discordant. Disconnected.
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
And make them martyrs?
You need patience.
Need to see the big picture.
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.
I take it out and look at it...
every day.
You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.
- The records are not the picture.
- Pietro.
No, please.
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.
When the first shell hits, two floors
below, it makes a hole in the floor.
It's big.
Our parents go in...
and the whole building
starts coming apart.
I grab her,
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.
But it doesn't go off.
It just...
sits there in the rubble.
Three feet from our faces.
And on the side of the shell
is painted one word.
"Stark."
We were trapped for two days.
Every effort to save us,
every shift in the bricks,
I think, "This will set it off."
We wait for two days
for Tony Stark to kill us.
I know what they are.
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.
Now I don't.
We will make it right.
You and I can hurt them.
But you will tear them apart...
from the inside.
He's all over the globe. Robotics labs,
weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs.
Reports of a metal man, or men,
coming in and emptying the place.
- Fatalities?
- Only when engaged.
Mostly guys left in a fugue state
going on about old memories,
worst fears,
and "something too fast to see."
Maximoffs.
That makes sense he'd go to them.
They have someone in common.
Not anymore.
That's a negative. I answer to you.
Yes, ma'am.
Barton. Might have something.
- I gotta go.
- Who was that?
Girlfriend.
- What's this?
- A message.
Ultron killed Strucker.
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.
This is a smoke screen. Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?
Strucker knew something
that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah. Everything
we had on Strucker's been erased.
Not everything.
Known associates.
- Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.
- Well, these people are all horrible.
Wait. I know that guy.
From back in the day. He operates
off the African coast. Black market arms.
There are conventions. All right?
You meet people. I didn't sell him anything.
He was talking about finding something new,
a game-changer. It was all very Ahab.
- This?
- It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.
Those are tattoos, this is a brand.
Yeah. It's a word in an African dialect
meaning "thief."
In a much less friendly way.
- What dialect?
- Wakanada. Wakanda.
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods...
I thought your father said
he got the last of it.
I don't follow.
What comes out of Wakanda?
The strongest metal on Earth.
Where is this guy now?
Don't tell me your men swindled you.
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.
Now, you will make it right,
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.
Now, minister, where were we?
Yeah. The Enhanced.
Strucker's prize pupils.
Do you want a candy?
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.
But then, he knew what kind of world
he was helping create.
Human life. Not a growth market.
You didn't know?
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.
- Everybody is afraid of something.
- Cuttlefish.
Deep sea fish.
They make lights, disco lights...
to hypnotize their prey, and then...
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.
So if you're going to fiddle
with my brain...
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,
then I know you don't do business.
And I know you're not in charge.
And I only deal...
with the man in charge.
There is no man in charge.
Let's talk business.
Upon this rock, I will build my church.
Vibranium.
You know, it came
at great personal cost.
It's worth billions.
Now so are you.
It's all under your dummy holdings.
Finance is so weird.
But I always say, "Keep your friends
rich and your enemies rich
"and wait to find out which is which."
Stark.
- What?
- Tony Stark used to say that.
To me.
- You're one of his.
- What? I'm not...
I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's
puppets? His hollow men?
I mean, look at me. Do I look like
Iron Man? Stark is nothing!
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.
It's just that I don't understand.
Don't compare me with Stark!
It's a thing with me.
Stark is... He's a sickness!
Junior.
You're gonna break your old man's heart.
If I have to.
- Nobody has to break anything.
- Clearly you've never made an omelet.
He beat me by one second.
Yes. He's funny. Mr. Stark.
It's what? Comfortable?
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.
- You two can still walk away from this.
- We will.
I know you've suffered.
Captain America.
God's righteous man.
Pretending you could live without a war.
I can't physically throw up
in my mouth, but...
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."
What's the vibranium for?
I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted
to take this time to explain my evil plan.
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?
- All of them!
- Move! Move! Move!
Stay down, kid.
It's time for some mind games.
Guys? Is this a code green?
- Thor, status.
- The girl tried to warp my mind.
Take special care. I doubt
a human could keep her at bay.
Fortunately, I am mighty.
This is going very well.
I've done the whole mind control thing.
Not a fan.
Yeah, you better run.
Who's ever standing, we got to move!
Guys?
- Again.
- You'll break them.
Only the breakable ones.
You're made of marble.
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.
What if I fail?
You never fail.
Are you ready for our dance?
Is it him?
Is that the first son of Odin?
Heimdall, your eyes.
They see everything.
They see you leading us to Hel.
Wake up!
The war is over, Steve. We can go home.
Imagine it.
- I can still save you!
- We're all dead! Can you not see?
You're a destroyer, Odinson.
See where your power leads.
Sloppy.
Pretending to fail.
The ceremony is necessary...
for you to take your place in the world.
- I have no place in the world.
- Exactly.
- What can I do?
- It hurts.
I'm going to kill him.
- I'll be right back.
- No. I'm all right.
I want...
I want to finish the plan.
I want the big one.
The vibranium is getting away.
- And you're not going anywhere.
- Of course not. I'm already there.
You'll catch on. But first,
you might need to catch Dr. Banner.
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.
That's not gonna happen.
Not for a while.
The whole team is down.
You got no backup here.
I'm calling in Veronica.
We need backup!
Go! Keep moving!
All right, everybody, stand down!
Will you listen to me?
That little witch is messing
with your mind.
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.
You're Bruce Banner. Right, right,
right, don't mention puny Banner.
Okay!
In the back? Dick move, Banner.
Veronica, give me a hand.
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.
Okay, pal,
we're gonna get you out of town.
Not that way, not that way.
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.
Everybody, out!
Going down?
I'm sorry.
Damage report?
That's comprehensive. Show me something.
How quickly can we buy this building?
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!
Flank him, flank him!
The news is loving you guys.
Nobody else is.
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest but it's in the air.
- The Stark Relief Foundation?
- Already on the scene.
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.
Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode
and stay away from here.
So, run and hide?
Until we can find Ultron,
I don't have a lot else to offer.
Neither do we.
- Hey, you wanna switch out?
- No, I'm good.
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time
because we're still a few hours out.
Few hours from where?
A safe house.
- What is this place?
- Safe house.
Let's hope.
Honey?
I'm home.
Hi. Company.
- Sorry, didn't call ahead.
- Hey.
This is an agent of some kind.
Gentlemen, this is Laura.
I know all of your names.
Incoming.
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!
Hey, buddy. How are you guys doing?
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Did you bring Auntie Nat?
Why don't you hug her and find out?
Sorry for barging in on you.
Yeah, we would've called ahead, but we were
busy having no idea that you existed.
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.
I'd like to keep it that way.
I figure it's a good place to lay low.
Honey.
I missed you.
- How's little Natasha?
- She's...
Nathaniel.
Traitor.
- Thor?
- I saw something in that dream.
I need answers. I won't find them here.
We can go home.
See? You worried for nothing.
Can't even feel the difference, can you?
If they're sleeping here, some of them
are gonna have to double up.
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?
How long has that been going on?
Has what?
- You are so cute.
- Nat and Banner?
I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.
Well, okay.
It's bad, right?
Nat seems really shaken.
Ultron has these allies.
These kids. They're punks, really.
But they carry a big, damn stick.
And Nat took a serious hit.
Someone's gonna have
to teach them some manners.
That someone being you.
You know I totally support
your avenging.
I couldn't be prouder.
But I see those guys... those gods...
You don't think they need me.
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.
They're a mess.
Yeah.
I guess they're my mess.
You need to be sure
that this team is really a team,
and that they have your back.
Things are changing for us.
In a few months' time, you and me
are gonna be outnumbered.
I need...
Just be sure.
Yes, ma'am.
I can feel the difference.
Scream, and your entire staff dies.
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met. I didn't.
- Do you expect a thank-you note?
- I expect you to know why.
The Cradle.
This is the next thing, Tony.
This is the next me.
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.
It can't build a living body.
It can. You can. You lack the materials.
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.
But we all have room to improve.
I didn't realize you were waiting.
I would've joined you, but...
it didn't seem like the right time.
They used up all the hot water.
- I should've joined you.
- Missed our window.
Did we?
The world just saw the Hulk.
The real Hulk, for the first time.
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?
I had this dream.
The kind that seems normal at the time,
- but when you wake...
- What did you dream?
That I was an Avenger.
That I was anything more
than the assassin they made me.
I think you're being hard on yourself.
Here I was hoping that was your job.
What are you doing?
I'm running with it.
With you.
If running is the plan,
as far as you want.
Are you out of your mind?
- I want you to understand that...
- Natasha,
where can I go?
Where in the world am I not a threat?
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?
Even if I didn't just...
There's no future with me.
I can't ever... I can't have this.
Kids.
Do the math. I physically can't.
Neither can I.
In the Red Room where I was trained...
where I was raised,
they have a graduation ceremony.
They sterilize you.
It's efficient.
One less thing to worry about.
The one thing that might matter more
than a mission.
Makes everything easier.
Even killing.
You still think you're
the only monster on the team?
So, we disappear?
Thor didn't say where
he was going for answers?
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.
Yeah, give him time.
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.
"Earth's mightiest heroes."
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.
Seems like you walked away all right.
- Is that a problem?
- I don't trust a guy without a dark side.
Call me old-fashioned.
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?
Well, I guess you'd know. Whether
you'd tell us is a bit of a question.
- Banner and I were doing research.
- That would affect the team.
That would end the team!
Isn't that the mission?
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"? So we can
end the fight. So we get to go home!
Every time someone tries to win a war
before it starts, innocent people die.
Every time.
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...
Clint said you wouldn't mind, but our tractor
doesn't seem to want to start at all.
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.
Don't take from my pile.
Hello, Deere.
Tell me everything.
What ails you?
Do me a favor.
Try not to bring it to life.
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?
- Was she ever not working for you?
- Artificial intelligence.
- You never even hesitated.
- Look, it's been a really long day,
like Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.
I'm just an old man
who cares very much about you.
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.
I saw it. I didn't tell the team.
How could I?
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.
The whole world, too.
Because of me.
I wasn't ready.
I didn't do all I could.
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.
The end of the path I started us on.
You come up with some
pretty impressive inventions, Tony.
War isn't one of them.
I watched my friends die. You'd think
that'd be as bad as it gets, right?
Nope.
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part... is that you didn't.
I'll see you tonight.
I like the look.
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.
- I need your help.
- It's nice to be needed.
It's dangerous.
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.
My contacts all say
he's building something.
The amount of vibranium he made off with,
I don't think it's just one thing.
- What about Ultron himself?
- He's easy to track. He's everywhere.
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.
Is he still going after launch codes?
Yes, he is.
But he's not making any headway.
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.
- Nexus?
- It's the world internet hub in Oslo.
Every byte of data flows through there.
Fastest access on Earth.
- So, what did they say?
- He's fixated on the missiles.
But the codes
are constantly being changed.
By whom?
- Parties unknown.
- Do we have an ally?
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.
I might need to visit Oslo.
Find our unknown.
Well, this is good times, boss,
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,
- you'd have more than that.
- I do. I have you.
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.
Ears, everywhere else.
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.
Here we all are, back on Earth,
with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world.
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing
between him and his mission.
And whether or not he admits it,
his mission is global destruction.
All this, laid in a grave.
So stand.
Outwit the platinum bastard.
- Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
- You know what, Romanoff?
So, what does he want?
To become better.
Better than us.
He keeps building bodies.
Person bodies.
The human form is inefficient.
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.
But he keeps coming back to it.
When you two programmed him to protect
the human race, you amazingly failed.
They don't need to be protected.
They need to evolve.
- Ultron's going to evolve.
- How?
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?
It's beautiful.
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible
with the tissue cells, they're binding them.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to...
- The most versatile substance on the planet,
and they used it to make a Frisbee.
Typical of humans.
They scratch the surface
and never think...
to look within.
I'll take Natasha and Clint.
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit
the Nexus. I'll join you as soon as I can.
- If Ultron's really building a body...
- He'll be more powerful than any of us.
Maybe all of us.
An android designed by a robot.
You know, I really miss the days when the
weirdest thing science ever created was me.
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
She's all yours. Apparently.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom
as soon as I get back.
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.
No.
It's the last project.
I promise.
So, this is it.
The Water of Sight.
In every realm, there's a reflection.
If the water's spirits accept me,
I can return to my dream...
and find what I missed.
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?
He could be anywhere.
And as this is the center of everything,
I'm just a guy looking for a needle
in the world's biggest haystack.
How do you find it?
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.
I'm decrypting nuclear codes
And you don't want me to
Come and get me.
Wake up!
Thor!
Extinction.
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...
now.
I can read him.
- He's dreaming.
- I wouldn't call it dreams.
It's Ultron's base consciousness.
- Informational noise. Soon...
- How soon? I'm not being pushy.
We're imprinting a physical brain.
There are no shortcuts.
Even if your magic gem...
- How could you?
- How could I what?
You said we would destroy the Avengers,
- make a better world.
- It will be better.
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.
- And if they don't?
- Ask Noah.
You are a madman.
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.
When the Earth starts to settle,
God throws a stone at it.
And, believe me, he's winding up.
We have to evolve.
There's no room for... the weak.
And who decides who's weak?
Life.
Life always decides.
There's incoming.
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.
Wait, guys!
They'll understand.
When they see, they'll understand.
I just need a little more time.
Two minutes. Stay close.
Dr. Cho!
- He's uploading himself into the body.
- Where?
The real power is inside the Cradle.
The gem... its power is uncontainable.
You can't just blow it up.
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.
- First, I have to find it.
- Go.
- Did you guys copy that?
- We did.
I got a private jet
taking off across town.
No manifest. That could be him.
There. It's a truck from the lab.
Right above you, Cap.
On the loop by the bridge.
It's them. You got three
with the Cradle, one in the cab.
- I could take out the driver.
- Negative.
That truck crashes,
the gem could level the city.
We need to draw out Ultron.
No, no, no, no.
Leave me alone!
Well, he's definitely unhappy.
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.
You're not a match for him, Cap.
Thanks, Barton.
You know what's in that cradle?
The power to make real change.
And that terrifies you.
I wouldn't call it a comfort.
Stop it.
We got a window. Four, three...
Give him hell.
I'm always picking up after you boys.
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.
- Which way?
- Hard right.
Now.
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!
Come on!
- Clint, can you draw out the guards?
- Let's find out.
Beep, beep!
They're heading back towards you.
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.
I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?
What do you think I've been doing?
Okay, package is airborne.
- I have a clean shot.
- Negative. I am still in the truck.
- What the hell are you...
- Be ready. I'm sending the package to you.
How do you want me to take it?
You might wish you hadn't asked that.
- Please, don't do this.
- What choice do we have?
I lost him! He's headed your way!
Nat, we gotta go.
Nat!
Cap, you see Nat?
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!
- Do you have eyes on Nat?
- Go!
Damn it.
Civilians in our path.
Can you stop this thing?
I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
I'm very tempted not to give you one.
- The Cradle. Did you get it?
- Stark will take care of it.
No, he won't.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Stark's not crazy.
He will do anything
to make things right.
Stark, come in. Stark.
Anyone on comms.
Ultron can't tell the difference
between saving the world and destroying it.
Where do you think he gets that?
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.
But she's alive, or Ultron
would be rubbing our faces in it.
This is sealed tight.
We're gonna need to access the program,
break it down from within.
Any chance Natasha might leave you
a message outside the Internet?
- Old-school spy stuff?
- There are some nets I can cast.
Yeah, I'll find her.
I can work on tissue degeneration
if you could fry
whatever operational system
Cho implanted.
Yeah, about that.
- No.
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.
- Our ally...
the guy protecting the military's
nuclear codes,
- I found him.
- Hello, Dr. Banner.
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.
He attacked him because he was scared
of what he can do.
So Jarvis went underground.
Scattered, dumped his memory.
But not his protocols.
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.
So,
you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?
No! Of course not. I wanna
help you put Jarvis in this thing.
We're out of my field, here.
You know bio-organics better than anyone.
And you just assume that Jarvis's
operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
Jarvis has been beating him from inside
without knowing it.
This is the opportunity.
We can create Ultron's perfect self
without the homicidal glitches he thinks
are his winning personality. We have to.
I believe it's worth a go.
I'm in a loop!
I'm caught in a time loop.
- This is exactly where it all went wrong.
- I know. I know.
I know what everyone's gonna say.
But they're already saying it.
We're mad scientists.
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.
Make a stand.
It's not a loop.
It's the end of the line.
I wasn't sure you would wake up.
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.
I don't have anyone else.
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.
Boom! The end. Start again.
The world made clean
for the new man to rebuild.
I was meant to be new.
I was meant to be beautiful.
The world would have looked
to the sky and seen hope,
seen mercy.
Instead, they'll look up in horror
because of you.
You've wounded me.
I give you full marks for that.
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...
just makes me stronger.
- This framework is not compatible.
- The genetic coding tower is at 97%.
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- And you do?
She's not in your head?
- I know you're angry.
- We're way past that.
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.
- Banner, after everything that's hap...
- It's nothing compared to what's coming!
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!
No, no. Go on.
You were saying?
Pietro!
What? You didn't see that coming?
I'm rerouting the upload.
Go ahead, piss me off.
Wait!
I am sorry. That was...
odd.
Thank you.
Thor.
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its center is that.
What? The gem?
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.
The greatest power in the universe,
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.
It's definitely the end times.
- The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
- Not alone.
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix...
to create something new.
I think I've had my fill of new.
You think I'm a child of Ultron.
You're not?
I'm not Ultron.
I am not Jarvis. I am...
I am.
I looked in your head
and saw annihilation.
- Look again.
- Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,
Ultron himself,
they all came from the Mind Stone.
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?
Are you?
On our side?
I don't think it's that simple.
Well, it better get
real simple real soon.
I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't.
- He will end it all.
- What's he waiting for?
- You.
- Where?
Sokovia. He's got Nat there, too.
If we're wrong about you,
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...
What will you do?
I don't want to kill Ultron.
He's unique and he's in pain.
But that pain will roll over the Earth.
So, he must be destroyed.
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.
We have to act now.
And not one of us can do it
without the others.
Maybe I am a monster.
I don't think I'd know if I were one.
I'm not what you are,
and not what you intended.
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.
But we need to go.
Right.
Well done.
Three minutes. Get what you need.
Good evening, boss.
No way we all get through this.
If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.
- There's gonna be blood on the floor.
- I got no plans tomorrow night.
I get first crack at the big guy.
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
That's true. He hates you the most.
Ultron knows we're coming.
Odds are we'll be riding
into heavy fire.
And that's what we signed up for.
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.
So our priority is getting them out.
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!
Get off your asses.
All they want is to live
their lives in peace.
And that's not gonna happen today.
But we can do our best to protect them.
And we can get the job done.
We find out what Ultron's been building,
we find Romanoff,
and we clear the field.
Keep the fight between us.
Ultron thinks we're monsters.
That we're what's wrong with the world.
This isn't just about beating him.
It's about whether he's right.
Natasha! Natasha!
Bruce?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.
Yeah. I did.
So what's our play?
- I'm here to get you to safety.
- Job's not finished.
We could help with the evacuation,
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.
And you've done plenty.
Our fight is over.
So, we just disappear?
Come on.
Your man's in the church, boss.
I think he's waiting for you.
Come to confess your sins?
- I don't know. How much time you got?
- More than you.
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."
You're stalling to protect the people.
Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?
I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm free.
What?
You think you were
the only one stalling?
There's the rest of the vibranium.
Function, still unclear.
This is how you end, Tony.
This is peace in my time.
Go!
Get off the bridge!
Run!
Ultron.
My Vision. They really did
take everything from me.
- You set the terms. You can change them.
- All right.
- Friday, the Vision?
- Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.
He won't escape through there.
You shut me out.
You think I care?
You take away my world...
I take away yours.
- Friday.
- Sokovia is going for a ride.
Do you see...
the beauty of it?
The inevitability.
You rise, only to fall.
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.
My swift and terrible sword.
And the earth will crack
with the weight of your failure.
Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.
It means nothing.
When the dust settles,
the only thing living in this world...
will be metal.
- We gotta move.
- You're not gonna turn green?
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.
I adore you.
But I need the other guy.
Let's finish the job.
I really hope this makes us even.
Now go be a hero.
The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.
That's what's keeping the rock together.
- If it drops?
- Right now, the impact can kill thousands.
Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.
That building's not clear.
The 10th floor.
Hi.
Okay. Get in the tub!
I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.
- Cap, you got incoming.
- Incoming already came in.
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.
The rest of us have one job,
tear these things apart.
You get hurt, hurt them back.
You get killed... walk it off.
Go, go, go!
- How could I let this happen?
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.
- Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.
Who cares? Are you up for this?
Are you?
Look, I just need to know.
Because the city is flying.
Okay. Look, the city is flying,
we're fighting an army of robots,
and I have a bow and arrow.
None of this makes sense.
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.
It doesn't matter what you did
or what you were.
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.
But if you step out that door,
you are an Avenger.
All right. Good chat.
Yeah, the city is flying.
I got you!
Just look at me!
You can't save them all.
You'll never...
"Never" what? You didn't finish!
What, were you napping?
Thor.
You're bothering me.
- All right, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear! We are very not clear!
All right, coming to you.
Keep up, old man!
Nobody would know.
Nobody.
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.
"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick
little bastard. I miss him already."
Hold your fire!
Romanoff!
Thanks!
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.
Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.
- The city's not coming down slow.
- Spire is vibranium.
- If I get Thor to hit it...
- It will crack. That's not enough.
- The impact would still be devastating.
- Maybe if we can cap the other end.
- Keep the atomic action doubling back.
- That could vaporize the city.
And everyone on it.
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.
What do you got, Stark?
Nothing great.
Maybe a way to blow up the city.
That'll keep it from impacting the surface,
if you guys can get clear.
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.
We're gonna have to make a choice.
Cap, these people are going nowhere.
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.
I didn't say we should leave.
There's worse ways to go.
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.
It's about to get better.
Nice, right?
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.
- She's dusty, but she'll do.
- Fury, you son of a bitch.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.
Lifeboats secure to deploy.
Disengage in three, two...
take them out.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.
This is not so bad.
Let's load them up.
Sir, we have multiple bogies
converging on our starboard flank.
- Show 'em what we got.
- You're up.
Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
Yup. If you live to tell it.
- You think I can't hold my own?
- We get through this, I'll hold your own.
You had to make it weird.
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.
- Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.
- Let's go, everyone!
Number six boat is topped and locked...
or stocked... topped...
It's full of people.
Incoming!
Oh, God!
You think you're saving anyone?
I turn that key and drop this rock
a little early and it's still billions dead.
- Even you can't stop that.
- I am Thor, son of Odin,
and as long as there is life
in my breast...
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?
It's terribly well-balanced.
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...
I got it. Create a heat seal.
I could... I could supercharge
the spire from below.
Running numbers.
A heat seal could work
with enough power.
- Thor, I got a plan.
- We're out of time.
They're coming for the core.
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.
- Are you good?
- Yeah.
Romanoff.
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."
Relax, shellhead. Not all of us can fly.
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.
Is that the best you can do?
You had to ask.
This is the best I can do.
This is exactly what I wanted.
All of you against all of me.
How can you possibly hope to stop me?
Well, like the old man said...
together.
You know, with the benefit
of hindsight...
- They'll try to leave the city.
- We can't let them, not even one.
- Rhodey.
- I'm on it.
No. I didn't say you could leave.
War Machine coming at you! Right...
Okay, what?
We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air
is getting thin. You guys get to the boats.
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.
It's my job.
Nat? This way.
Get the people on the boats.
- I'm not going to leave you here.
- I can handle this.
Come back for me when
everyone else is off. Not before.
You understand?
- You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.
- Go.
- Boss, power levels are way below...
- Reroute everything. We get one shot at this.
I know what I need to do.
The dining room.
If I knock out that east wall, it'd make
a nice workspace for Laura, huh?
Put up some baffling. She can't hear
the kids running around. What do you think?
- You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
- No one eats in a dining room.
- We don't have a lot of time.
- So get your ass on a boat.
Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.
Secure your gear, find a seat.
Costel!
We were in the market.
Costel!
Thor, I'm gonna need you
back in the church.
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
You know, this works,
we maybe don't walk away.
Maybe not.
I got no strings, so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
Come on. Time to go.
You didn't see that coming?
For God's sake.
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!
No, no, I'm fine. Fine.
It's been a long day.
Wanda.
If you stay here...
you'll die.
I just did. Do you know how it felt?
It felt like that.
Thor, on my mark.
Now!
Hey, big guy.
We did it. The job is finished.
Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode.
So help me out. I need you...
You're afraid.
- Of you?
- Of death.
You're the last one.
You were supposed to be the last.
Stark asked for a savior
and settled for a slave.
I suppose we are both disappointments.
- I suppose we are.
- Humans are odd.
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites and...
try to control what won't be.
But there is grace in their failings.
I think you missed that.
- They're doomed.
- Yes.
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.
It's a privilege to be among them.
You're unbearably naive.
Well...
I was born yesterday.
Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!
Fat.
One of our tech boys flagged this.
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.
Could be the Quinjet.
But with Stark's stealth tech,
we still can't track the damn thing.
Right.
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.
He'll send a postcard.
"Wish you were here."
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.
Did you know then what was gonna happen?
You never know.
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.
I got a great team.
Nothing lasts forever.
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.
The rules have changed.
- We're dealing with something new.
- The Vision is artificial intelligence.
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?
No, it's not like a person
lifting the hammer.
Right, different rules for us.
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.
It's safe with the Vision.
And these days, safe is in short supply.
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.
I'm gonna miss
these little talks of ours.
- Not if you don't leave.
- I have no choice.
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity
Stones to show up in the last few years.
It's not a coincidence.
Someone has been playing
an intricate game and has made pawns of us.
And once all these pieces
are in position...
Triple Yahtzee.
- You think you can find out what's coming?
- I do.
Besides this one, there's nothing
that can't be explained.
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.
- I will miss you, Tony.
- Yeah?
Well, it's time for me to tap out.
Maybe I should take a page
out of Barton's book.
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.
- The simple life.
- You'll get there one day.
I don't know. Family, stability...
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.
I think someone else came out.
You all right?
I'm home.
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.
I thought you and Tony were still gazing
into each other's eyes. How do we look?
- Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
- We got some hitters.
- They're good. They're not a team.
- Let's beat them into shape.
Avengers...
Fine.
I'll do it myself.

Good morning, Soldier.
Ready to comply.
I have a mission for you.
Sanction and extract.
No witnesses.
Well done Soldier.
All right, what do you see?
Standard beat cops.
Small station.
Quiet street.
It's a good target.
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?
Cameras.
Both cross streets are one-way.
So, compromised escape routes.
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.
He isn't afraid
to make a mess on the way out.
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.
It's also bulletproof,
which means private security...
which means more guns, which means more
headaches for somebody. Probably us.
You guys know
I can move things with my mind, right?
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?
Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?
Eyes on target, folks.
This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow
in six months. I don't want to lose him.
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.
He kind of hates us.
Sam...
see that garbage truck?
Tag it.
Give me X-ray.
That truck's loaded for max weight.
And the driver's armed.
It's a battering ram.
- Go now.
- What?
He's not hitting the police.
Body armour, AR-15s.
I make seven hostiles.
I make five.
Sam.
Four.
Rumlow's on the third floor.
Wanda, just like we practised.
What about the gas?
Get it out.
Pack it up.
He's here.
Rumlow has a biological weapon.
I'm on it.
I don't work like that no more.
Fire in the hole.
No!
Sam.
He's in an AFV heading north.
Take this to the airstrip.
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.
Where are you going to meet us?
I'm not.
I've got four, they're splitting up.
I got the two on the left.
They ditched their gear.
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.
There you are, you son of a bitch.
I've been waiting for this.
He doesn't have it.
I'm empty!
Out of the way!
Drop it.
Or I'll drop this.
- Drop it!
- He'll do it!
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
Don't thank me.
I'm not thanking that thing.
His name is Redwing.
I'm still not thanking it.
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
Come on!
This is for dropping
a building on my face.
Ahh!
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.
Who's your buyer?
You know, he knew you.
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
What did you say?
He remembered you.
I was there. He got all weepy about it.
Till they put his brain back in a blender.
He wanted you to know something.
He said to me...
"Please tell Rogers.
"When you gotta go...
"you gotta go."
And you're coming with me.
Oh, my...
Sam...
we need Fire and Rescue
on the south side of the building.
We gotta get up there.
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye to your father.
Who's the homeless person on the couch?
This is why
I love coming home for Christmas...
right before you leave town.
Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Really? Which broad? What's her name?
Candice.
Do me a favour?
Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.
Okay, so it's Monday.
That is good to know,
I will plan my toga party accordingly.
Where you going?
Your father's flying us
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
We might have to make a quick stop.
At the Pentagon. Right?
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.
I'll get the bags.
He does miss you when you're not here.
And frankly, you're going to miss us.
Because this is the last time
we're all going to be together.
You know what's about to happen.
Say something.
If you don't, you'll regret it.
I love you, Dad.
And I know you did the best you could.
That's how I wish it happened.
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...
or BARF.
God, I gotta work on that acronym.
An extremely costly method
of hijacking the hippocampus...
to clear traumatic memories.
Huh.
It doesn't change the fact that they
never made it to the airport...
or all the things I did to avoid
processing my grief, but...
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?
"To generate, disseminate...
"and preserve knowledge.
"And work with others...
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."
Well, you are the others.
And, quiet as it's kept...
the challenges facing you
are the greatest mankind's ever known.
Plus, most of you are broke.
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.
As of this moment...
every student has been made
an equal recipient...
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.
As in...
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.
No strings, no taxes...
just reframe the future!
Starting now.
Go break some eggs.
Wow. Wow.
That took my breath away.
Oh, Tony! So generous.
So much money! Wow!
Out of curiosity...
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...
Restroom's this way, yeah?
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
Mr Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.
I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled.
They didn't have time to fix it.
It's fine. I'll be right back.
We'll catch up later.
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.
Ah, they deserve it.
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.
But if you've got the money...
break as many eggs as you like.
Right?
Are you going up?
I'm right where I want to be.
Okay. Hey.
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
I work for the State Department.
Human Resources.
I know it's boring...
but it enabled me to raise a son.
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
His name was Charlie Spencer.
You murdered him.
In Sokovia.
Not that that matters in the least to you.
You think you fight for us?
You just fight for yourself.
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?
He's dead...
and I blame you.
11 Wakandans were among
those killed during a confrontation...
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...
in Lagos, Nigeria last month.
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans
were on an outreach mission...
in Lagos, when the attack occurred.
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...
not only because of
the actions of criminals...
but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.
Victory at the expense of the innocent...
is no victory at all.
The Wakandan king went on to...
They are operating outside
and above the international law.
Because that's the reality,
if we don't respond to acts like these.
What legal authority does an enhanced
individual like Wanda Maximoff have...
to operate in Nigeri...?
It's my fault.
That's not true.
Turn the TV back on.
They're being very specific.
I should've clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.
Rumlow said "Bucky"...
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,
in Brooklyn.
And people died.
It's on me.
It's on both of us.
This job...
We try to save as many people as we can.
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody.
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...
then next time...
maybe nobody gets saved.
Vis! We talked about this.
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.
Thank you. We'll be right down.
I'll use the door.
Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
We know who it is?
The Secretary of State.
Five years ago...
I had a heart attack...
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...
because after 13 hours
of surgery and a triple bypass...
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.
Perspective.
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.
You have fought for us...
protected us, risked your lives...
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...
there are some...
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."
What word would you use, Mr Secretary?
How about "dangerous"?
What would you call a group
of US-based, enhanced individuals...
who routinely ignore sovereign borders...
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned
about what they leave behind?
New York.
Washington, D.C.
Sokovia.
Lagos.
Okay. That's enough.
For the past four years,
you've operated with unlimited power...
and no supervision.
That's an arrangement the governments
of the world can no longer tolerate.
But I think we have a solution.
The Sokovia Accords.
Approved by 117 countries...
it states that the Avengers
shall no longer be a private organisation.
Instead...
they'll operate under the supervision
of a United Nations panel...
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.
I feel we've done that.
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...
you can bet there'd be consequences.
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.
Believe me, this is the middle ground.
So, there are contingencies.
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...
to ratify the Accords.
Talk it over.
And if we come
to a decision you don't like?
Then you retire.
Hello?
Is this your car out front?
I jumped the kerb.
Maybe we could...
take care of it ourselves.
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...
- I guess.
- No.
No cops.
Thank you.
You have kept your looks, Colonel.
Congratulations.
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."
Who are you?
My name is Zemo.
I will repeat my question.
Mission report, December 16, 1991.
How did you find me?
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.
Not easy to decipher.
But, I have experience.
And patience.
A man can do anything if he has those.
What do you want?
Mission report.
December 16.
Go... to... hell!
HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap.
So your death would not bother me.
But I'd have to use this book...
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.
I don't look forward to that.
You'd only be dying for...
your pride.
Hail HYDRA.
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honour...
which is one more than you have.
So let's say we agree to this thing.
How long is it gonna be before they
LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
117 countries want to sign this.
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."
How long are you going to play both sides?
I have an equation.
Oh, this will clear it up.
In the eight years since Mr Stark
announced himself as Iron Man...
the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.
During the same period...
the number of potentially
world-ending events
has risen at a commensurate rate.
Are you saying it's our fault?
I'm saying there may be a causality.
Our very strength invites challenge.
Challenge incites conflict.
And conflict...
breeds catastrophe.
Oversight...
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.
Boom.
Tony.
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.
It's because he's already
made up his mind.
Boy, you know me so well.
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.
It's discomfort.
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.
He's a great kid.
Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA...
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.
Maybe be of service.
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or
Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do.
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.
He decided to spend his summer building
sustainable housing for the poor.
Guess where. Sokovia.
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose.
We won't know because we dropped
a building on him while we were kicking ass.
There's no decision-making process here.
We need to be put in check!
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.
If we can't accept limitations,
if we're boundary-less...
we're no better than the bad guys.
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.
Who said we're giving up?
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.
This document just shifts the blame.
I'm sorry, Steve.
That is dangerously arrogant.
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.
It's not the World Security Council,
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.
No, but it's run by people
with agendas, and agendas change.
That's good. That's why I'm here.
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...
I shut it down and stopped manufacturing.
Tony, you chose to do that.
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?
What if there is somewhere we need
to go and they don't let us?
We may not be perfect,
but the safest hands are still our own.
If we don't do this now,
it's gonna be done to us later.
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
You're saying they'll come for me.
We would protect you.
Maybe Tony's right.
If we have one hand on the wheel,
we can still steer. If we take it off...
Aren't you the same woman who told the
government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
I'm just reading the terrain.
We have made some very public mistakes.
We need to win their trust back.
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...
- or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.
No, you can't retract it.
Thank you. Unprecedented.
Okay. Case closed. I win.
I have to go.
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter
to come up and say a few words.
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
She had a photograph in her office.
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.
As a kid, that was pretty cool.
But it was a lot to live up to.
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.
I asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage...
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.
She said, compromise where you can.
But where you can't, don't.
Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."
When I came out of the ice, I thought
everyone I had known was gone.
Then I found out she was alive.
I was just lucky to have her.
She had you back, too.
Who else signed?
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.
Clint?
Says he's retired.
- Wanda?
- TBD.
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.
There's plenty of room on the jet.
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.
What are we giving up to do it?
I'm sorry, Nat.
I can't sign it.
I know.
Then what are you doing here?
I didn't want you to be alone.
Come here.
At a special United Nations conference...
117 countries have come together
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?
- Yes?
- These need your signature.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.
Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
You seem to be doing all right so far.
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.
Well, I'm not.
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.
Why? You don't approve of all this?
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.
Unless you need to move a piano.
Ms Romanoff.
King T'Chaka.
Please, allow me to apologise
for what happened in Nigeria.
Thank you.
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.
Yes, so am I.
If everyone could please be seated.
This assembly is now in session.
That is the future calling.
Such a pleasure.
Thank you.
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,
you're getting quite good at it.
I'm happy, Father.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When stolen Wakandan vibranium
was used to make a terrible weapon...
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.
Those men and women killed in Nigeria...
were part of a goodwill mission
from a country too long in the shadows.
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.
Wakanda is proud
to extend its hand in peace.
Everybody get down!
My mom tried
to talk me out of enlisting...
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.
She bought me my first thigh holster.
Very practical.
And stylish.
CIA has you stationed over here now?
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Right. Right. Sounds fun.
I know, right?
I've been meaning to ask you.
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...
You mean when I was doing my job.
Did Peggy know?
She kept so many secrets.
I didn't want her to have one from you.
Thanks for walking me back.
Sure.
Steve.
There's something you gotta see.
A bomb hidden in a news van...
Who's coordinating?
...ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.
Good. They're solid. Forensics?
More than 70 people have been injured.
At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.
Officials have released
a video of a suspect...
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...
the Winter Soldier.
The infamous HYDRA agent...
linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.
I have to go to work.
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.
We need the whole team here
in two hours or it's not worth it.
I'm very sorry.
In my culture...
death is not the end.
It's more of a stepping-off point.
You reach out with both hands...
and Bast and Sekhmet,
they lead you into the green veldt...
where you can run forever.
That sounds very peaceful.
My father thought so.
I am not my father.
T'Challa...
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.
I'll kill him myself.
Yeah?
You all right?
Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.
Stay home. You'll only make this worse.
For all of us.
Please.
Are you saying you'll arrest me?
No.
Someone will.
If you interfere. That's how it works now.
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in.
Why?
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.
Shit.
She tell you to stay out of it?
Might have a point.
He'd do it for me.
1945, maybe.
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.
The people that shoot at you
usually wind up shooting at me.
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.
Most of it's noise.
Except for this.
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.
Thank you.
You're gonna have to hurry.
We have orders to shoot on sight.

Freight car
I have your breakfast.
I could smell it before I opened the door.
Side of bacon and black coffee.
Again.
I can make you something
different, if you like.
This is wonderful...
I will just put this on your...
It's okay, I can manage!
Heads up, Cap.
German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.
Understood.
Do you know me?
You're Steve.
I read about you in a museum.
They've set the perimeter.
I know you're nervous,
and you have plenty of reason to be.
But you're lying.
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that any more.
They're entering the building.
Well, the people
who think you did are coming here now.
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.
That's smart.
Good strategy.
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.
- It always ends in a fight.
- Five seconds.
You pulled me from the river.
Why?
- I don't know.
- Three seconds.
Yes, you do.
Breach! Breach! Breach!
Buck, stop!
You're gonna kill someone.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.
Suspect has broken containment!
...he's headed down the east stairwell!
Come on, man.
Ahhh!
Sam, southwest rooftop.
Who the hell's the other guy?
About to find out.
- Sam.
- Got him.
Stand down!
Stand down!
Sam, I can't shake this guy.
Right behind you.
Stand down, now.
Congratulations, Cap.
You're a criminal.
Your Highness.
"A pinch of paprika."
A pinch.
Is that paprikash?
I thought it might lift your spirits.
Spirits lifted.
In my defence, I haven't actually
ever eaten anything before, so...
May I?
Please.
- Wanda?
- Hmm.
No one dislikes you, Wanda.
Thanks.
Oh, you're welcome.
No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.
They can't help but be afraid of you.
Are you?
My amygdala is synthetic, so...
I used to think of myself one way.
But after this...
I am something else.
I'm still me, I think, but...
that's not what everyone else sees.
Do you know, I don't know what this is?
Not really.
I know it's not of this world...
that it powered Loki's staff,
gave you your abilities, but...
its true nature is a mystery.
And yet, it is part of me.
Are you afraid of it?
I wish to understand it.
The more I do, the less it controls me.
One day... who knows?
I may even control it.
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.
I'm gonna go to the store.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
Vision, are you not letting me leave?
It is a question of safety.
I can protect myself.
Not yours.
Mr Stark would like to avoid
the possibility of another public incident.
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.
And what do you want?
For people to see you...
as I do.
So, you like cats?
- Sam.
- What?
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?
Your suit... it's vibranium?
The Black Panther has been the protector
of Wakanda for generations.
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...
I also wear the mantle of king.
So, I ask you...
as both warrior and king...
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?
What's gonna happen to him?
Same thing that ought to happen to you.
Psychological evaluation and extradition.
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.
What about a lawyer?
Lawyer. That's funny.
See their weapons are placed in lockup.
We'll write you a receipt.
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.
You'll be provided
with an office instead of a cell.
Now, do me a favour, stay in it?
I don't intend on going anywhere.
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.
He's alive.
No.
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.
Obviously you can quote me on that,
because I just said it. Anything else?
Thank you, sir.
"Consequences"?
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted.
Had to give him something.
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
Technically, it's the
government's property.
Wings, too.
That's cold.
Warmer than jail.
Hey, you wanna see something cool?
I pulled something from Dad's archives.
Felt timely.
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.
I'm trying to... What do you call it?
That's an olive branch.
Is that what you call it?
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
We're kinda...
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?
No. Definitely not.
We're taking a break.
It's nobody's fault.
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...
and then Ultron. My fault.
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.
I don't wanna lose her.
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.
In her defence, I'm a handful.
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,
but he and Mom always made it work.
I'm glad Howard got married.
I only knew him
when he was young and single.
Oh, really? You two knew each other?
He never mentioned that.
Maybe only a thousand times.
God, I hated you.
I don't mean to make things difficult.
I know, because you're
a very polite person.
If I see a situation pointed south...
I can't ignore it.
Sometimes I wish I could.
No, you don't.
No, I don't.
Sometimes...
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.
But I don't wanna see you gone.
We need you, Cap.
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.
We can make the last 24 hours legit.
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-centre...
instead of a Wakandan prison.
I'm not saying it's impossible...
but there would have to be safeguards.
Sure.
Once we put out the PR fire,
those documents can be amended.
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...
Wanda? What about Wanda?
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.
Vision's keeping her company.
Oh, God, Tony.
Every time I think you see
things the right way...
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.
It's got a screening room.
There's worse ways to protect people.
Protection?
Is that how you see this?
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.
She's a kid!
Give me a break!
I'm doing what has to be done.
To stave off something worse.
You keep telling yourself that.
Hate to break up the set.
Hello, Mr Barnes.
I've been sent by
the United Nations to evaluate you.
Do you mind if I sit?
Your first name is James?
The receipt for your gear.
"Bird costume"? Come on.
I didn't write it.
I'm not here to judge you.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
Do you know where you are, James?
I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.
My name is Bucky.
Hello?
Hey!
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?
Steve, we looked for the guy
for two years and found nothing.
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee
that whoever framed him would get him.
It guarantees that we would.
Yeah.
Tell me, Bucky.
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You fear that if you open your mouth,
the horrors might never stop.
Don't worry.
We only have to talk about one.
Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.
Friday, get me a source on that outage.
Sub-level five, East Wing.
What the hell is this?
Why don't we discuss your home?
Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no.
I mean your real home.

Mission report. December 16, 1991.
Help me.
Help.
Get up.
Who are you? What do you want?
To see an empire fall.
Hey.
Evac all civilians.
Get me a perimeter around the building,
and gunships in the air.
Please tell me you brought a suit.
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.
I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
Follow me.
We're in position.
You could at least recognise me.
Damn it.
He asked me again
if you were going to be there.
I said I wasn't sure.
You should have seen his
little face. Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
James Barnes the suspect
in the UN Vienna bombing...
...escaped custody today.
...also missing Avenger
Captain Steve Rogers...
and Sam Wilson.
Hey, Cap!
Steve.
Which Bucky am I talking to?
Your mom's name was Sarah.
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Can't read that in a museum.
Just like that, we're supposed to be cool?
What did I do?
Enough.
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.
- Who was he?
- I don't know.
People are dead. The bombing, the setup...
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.
I need you to do
better than "I don't know."
He wanted to know about Siberia.
Where I was kept.
He wanted to know exactly where.
Why would he need to know that?
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
It hurts!
Good work.
Get me out of here.
Who were they?
Their most elite death squad.
More kills than anyone in HYDRA history.
And that was before the serum.
They all turn out like you?
Worse.
The doctor, could he control them?
Enough.
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
With these guys, he could do it.
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise.
They can take a whole country down
in one night, you'd never see them coming.
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.
- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.
Even if he did...
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.
We're on our own.
Maybe not.
I know a guy.
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?
We will.
GSG 9's got the borders covered.
Recon's flying 24/7.
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.
It's clear you can't be objective.
I'm putting Special Ops on this.
What happens when the shooting starts?
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
If we're provoked.
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.
There are dead people
who would be alive now.
Feel free to check my math.
All due respect, you're not gonna
solve this with boys and bullets, Ross.
You gotta let us bring them in.
How would that end
any differently than last time?
Because this time, I won't be
wearing loafers and a silk shirt.
72 hours, guaranteed.
36 hours.
Barnes.
Rogers.
Wilson.
Thank you, sir.
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?
You all right?
Always.
36 hours. Jeez.
We're seriously understaffed.
Oh, yeah.
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
You really think he'd be on our side?
No.
I have an idea.
Me, too. Where's yours?
Downstairs.
Where's yours?
Hey, May.
Mmm. Hey.
How was school today?
It was okay.
This crazy car parked outside.
- Oh, Mr Parker.
- Um...
What are you doing...
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.
Tony.
What are you doing here?
It's about time we met.
You've been getting my emails, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?
Regarding the...
You didn't even tell me about the grant.
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.
- Right.
- Yeah.
Remember when you applied?
Yeah.
I approved, so now we're in business.
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?
You keeping secrets from me now?
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...
Anyway, what did I apply for?
That's what I'm here to hash out.
Okay. Hash it out, okay.
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.
Yeah? Wow.
Look who you're talking to.
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.
As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.
Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh?
Thrift store? Salvation Army?
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?
Yeah, I was...
Anyway, look, um, I definitely
did not apply for your grant...
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.
That's you, right?
Um, no.
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.
Look at you go.
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.
That's not easy. You got mad skills.
That's all on YouTube, though, right?
That's where you found that?
Because you know that's all fake.
It's all done on the computer.
Mmm-hmm.
It's like that video. What is it?
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?
Exactly.
Oh, what have we here?
Uh...
You're the Spider-ling.
Crime-fighting spider. You're Spider-Boy?
Spider-Man.
Not in that onesie, you're not.
It's not a onesie.
I don't believe this. I was actually
having a really good day today, Mr Stark.
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...
and Algebra test, nailed it.
Who else knows? Anybody?
Nobody.
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?
No. No.
No! If she knew, she would freak out.
And when she freaks out, I freak out.
You know what I think is really cool?
This webbing.
That tensile strength is off the charts.
Who manufactured that?
I did.
Climbing walls, how you doing that?
Adhesive gloves?
It's a long story. I was...
Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Yes, I can.
I'm blind!
I can see in those.
Okay?
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.
You're in dire need of an upgrade.
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.
That's why I'm here.
Why you doing this?
I gotta know, what's your MO?
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?
Because...
Because I've been me my whole life,
and I've had these powers for six months.
Mmm-hmm.
I read books, I build computers.
Yeah, I would love to play football,
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.
Sure, because you're different.
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...
and then the bad things happen...
they happen because of you.
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.
That's what it is.
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.
You got a passport?
No, I don't even have a driver's licence.
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.
Oh, you'll love it.
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?
I got homework.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.
Might be a little dangerous.
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.
Don't tell Aunt May.
All right, Spider-Man.
Get me out of this.
Sorry. I'll get the...
What is it?
Stay here, please.
Guess I shoulda knocked.
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?
Disappointing my kids.
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.
Cap needs our help. Come on.
Clint!
You should not be here.
Really?
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.
Okay, they're considered.
Okay, we gotta go.
It's this way.
I've caused enough problems.
You gotta help me, Wanda.
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.
Shit.
I knew I should've stretched.
Clint, you can't overpower me.
I know I can't.
But she can.
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.
I'm leaving.
I can't let you.
I'm sorry.
If you do this...
they will never stop being afraid of you.
I can't control their fear, only my own.
Oh...
Come on. We got one more stop.
It's just a matter of time.
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,
and behavioural pattern scans.
Move or you will be moved.
As entertaining as that would be...
You really think you can find him?
My resources are considerable.
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.
You know where they are.
I know someone who does.
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.
It's low profile.
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.
Can you move your seat up?
No.
I owe you again.
Keeping a list.
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.
They're going to come looking for you.
I know.
Thank you, Sharon.
That was...
Late.
Damn right.
I should go.
Okay.
Cap.
You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.
Besides, I owe a debt.
Thanks for having my back.
It was time to get off my ass.
How about our other recruit?
He's rarin' to go.
Had to put a little coffee in him...
but he should be good.
What time zone is this?
Come on. Come on.
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.
It's an honour.
I'm shaking your hand too long.
Wow! This is awesome!
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!
Jeez.
Ah, look, I wanna say, I know
you know a lot of super people, so...
thinks for thanking of me.
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?
Uh, good to see you.
Look, what happened last time when I...
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.
They tell you what we're up against?
Something about some psycho-assassins?
We're outside the law on this one.
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.
Yeah, well, what else is new?
We should get moving.
We got a chopper lined up.
They're evacuating the airport.
Stark.
Stark?
Suit up.
Wow, it's so weird how you run
into people at the airport.
- Don't you think that's weird?
- Definitely weird.
Hear me out, Tony.
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.
Captain.
Your Highness.
Anyway...
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?
You're after the wrong guy.
Your judgement is askew.
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.
And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.
Steve...
you know what's about to happen.
Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?
All right, I've run out of patience.
Underoos!
- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.
It's perfect. Thank you.
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.
Okay. Cap. Captain.
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.
- Hey, everyone.
- Good job.
You've been busy.
And you've been a complete idiot.
Dragging in Clint...
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place she doesn't
even want to leave, a safe place.
I'm trying to keep...
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.
You did that when you signed.
All right, we're done.
You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna
come with us, now, because it's us...
or a squad of J-SOC guys...
with no compunction about being impolite.
Come on.
We found it.
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.
All right, Lang.
Hey, guys, something...
Whoa. What the hell was that?
I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Oh, great.
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.
Barnes is mine.
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?
What we discussed.
Keep your distance, web them up.
Okay, copy that.
Move, Captain.
I won't ask a second time.
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
I wouldn't stress about it.
What the hell is that?
Everyone's got a gimmick now.
You have a metal arm?
That is awesome, dude.
You have the right to remain silent!
Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...
but it ain't gonna tickle either.
Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
You locked me in my room.
Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.
Second, I did it to protect you.
- Hey, Clint.
- Hey, man.
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.
You got tired of shooting golf?
Well, I played 18, shot 18.
Just can't seem to miss.
First time for everything.
Made you look.
Multiple contusions detected.
Yeah, I detected that, too.
Oh, God!
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!
Ahh!
Those wings carbon fibre?
Is this stuff coming out of you?
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...
but there's usually not this much talking.
All right, sorry. My bad.
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,
but I've only got one job here today...
and I gotta impress Mr Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.
You couldn't have done that earlier?
I hate you.
Great.
Hey, Cap, heads-up!
Throw it at this.
Now!
Oh, come on!
Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.
Uh, sorry.
All right, now I'm pissed.
Is this part of the plan?
Well, my plan was go easy on them.
You wanna switch it up?
There's our ride.
Come on!
Captain Rogers...
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.
But for the collective good...
you must surrender now.
What do we do, Cap?
We fight.
This is gonna end well.
They're not stopping.
Neither are we.
We're still friends, right?
Depends on how hard you hit me.
You were pulling your punches.
I didn't kill your father.
Then why did you run?
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.
He also said to go for your legs.
Ahh!
Clint, can you get him off me?
Buckled in?
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!
Stark tell you anything else?
That you're wrong. You think you're right.
That makes you dangerous.
Guess he had a point.
You got heart, kid. Where you from?
Queens.
Brooklyn.
Friday?
We have some weapon systems offline.
What?
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.
Who's speaking?
It's your conscience.
We don't talk a lot these days.
Friday?
Deploying fire suppression system.
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy!
Whoa!
We gotta go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
We gotta draw out the flyers.
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.
No, you get to the jet!
Both of you!
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
As much as I hate to admit it...
if we're gonna win this one,
some of us might have to lose it.
This isn't the real fight, Steve.
All right, Sam. What's the play?
We need a diversion. Something big.
I got something kinda big.
But I can't hold it very long.
On my signal, run like hell.
And if I tear myself in half...
don't come back for me.
He's gonna tear himself in half?
You sure about this, Scott?
I do it all the time.
I mean, once. In a lab.
Then I passed out.
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.
Holy shit!
Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
I guess that's the signal.
Way to go, Tic Tac!
Give me back my Rhodey.
I got him.
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...
I'm open to suggestions.
You wanna get to them...
you gotta go through me.
Uh-huh.
We haven't met yet.
- I'm Clint.
- I don't care.
Whoa!
Ahhh!
Get off!
Something just flew in me!
You're not gonna stop.
You know I can't.
I'm gonna regret this.
Go.
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,
Empire Strikes Back?
Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.
He's on the young side.
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet...
with the walking thingies?
Maybe the kid's onto something.
High now, Tony. Go high.
Yes!
That was awesome!
Does anyone have any orange slices?
Kid, you all right?
Whoa!
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.
- That was scary.
- Yeah.
You're done, all right?
What? I'm good, I'm fine.
You did a good job. Stay down.
No, it's good. I gotta get him back.
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!
- Dude.
- You're done!
Wait.
Mr Stark, wait. I'm not done. I'm not...
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
I said I'd help you find him,
not catch him.
There's a difference.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
It's as I said.
Catastrophe.
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.
Vision! You copy?
Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.
Rhodey!
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.
Rhodes!
Read vitals.
Heartbeat detected.
Emergency medical is on its way.
I'm sorry.
- this is room 201...
Bacon and black coffee again today?
You know me so well...
Hello? Your breakfast is here.
May I let myself in?
What's gonna happen to your friends?
Whatever it is...
I'll deal with it.
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
What you did all those years...
It wasn't you.
You didn't have a choice.
I know.
But I did it.
How did this happen?
I became distracted.
I didn't think that was possible.
Neither did I.
The doctors say he shattered
L4 through S1.
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.
Steve's not gonna stop.
If you don't either, Rhodey's
gonna be the best case scenario.
You let them go, Nat.
We played this wrong.
"We"?
Boy, it must be hard to shake
the whole double agent thing, huh?
It sticks in the DNA.
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...
for one goddamn second?
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...
they're coming for you.
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.
What am I looking at, Friday?
Priority upload from Berlin police.
Fire up the chopper.
The Task Force called for a psychiatrist
as soon as Barnes was captured.
The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard
from Geneva within the hour.
He was met by this man.
Did you run facial recognition yet?
What do I look like?
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.
You must be thinking of someone else.
Must be.
The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.
Sokovian Intelligence.
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...
a Sokovian covert kill squad.
What happened to the real Broussard?
He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room.
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Son of a bitch.
- Get this to Ross.
- Yes, boss.
This is Raft Prison Control.
You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.
So? You got the files?
Let's reroute the satellites,
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
You seriously think I'm gonna listen
to you after that fiasco in Leipzig?
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.
The Futurist, gentlemen!
The Futurist is here!
He sees all!
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.
Give me a break, Barton.
I had no idea
they'd put you here. Come on.
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...
Criminals?
Criminals, Tony.
Think that's the word you're looking for.
Right?
That didn't used to mean me.
Or Sam, or Wanda.
But here we are.
- Because you broke the law.
- Yeah.
I didn't make you.
- La, la, la, la, la...
- You read it, you broke it.
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.
I don't understand, why didn't you
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?
You gotta watch your back with this guy.
There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.
Who are you?
Come on, man.
How's Rhodes?
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...
so fingers crossed.
What do you need? They feed you yet?
You're the good cop, now?
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.
Well, you better go get a bad cop...
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...
to get information out of me.
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.
What'd you do?
Get it back up!
Just look.
Because that...
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.
That's a first.
Cap is definitely off the reservation...
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.
We don't know each other very well.
You don't have to...
Hey, it's all right.
Look, I'll tell you...
but you have to go alone and as a friend.
Easy.
Stark?
Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Nope. Told me to go to hell.
I'm going back to the compound instead,
but you can call me anytime.
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.
You remember that time we had to ride back
from Rockaway Beach
in the back of that freezer truck?
Was that the time we used our train money
to buy hot dogs?
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.
What was her name, again?
Dolores. You called her Dot.
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.
So are we, pal.
He can't have been here
more than a few hours.
Long enough to wake them up.
You ready?
Yeah.
You seem a little defensive.
It's been a long day.
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.
Then why are you here?
Could be your story's not so crazy.
Maybe.
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.
It's good to see you, Tony.
You too, Cap.
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.
There's a truce here. You can drop...
I got heat signatures.
How many?
Uh, one.
If it's any comfort,
they died in their sleep.
Did you really think I wanted more of you?
What the hell?
I'm grateful to them, though.
They brought you here.
Please, Captain.
The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
I'm betting I could beat that.
Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.
Given time.
But then you'd never know why you came.
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.
I studied you.
I followed you.
But now that you're standing here...
I just realised...
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.
How nice to find a flaw.
You're Sokovian.
Is that what this is about?
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.
No.
I'm here because I made a promise.
You lost someone?
I lost everyone.
And so will you.
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.
But one which crumbles from within?
That's dead.
Forever.
I know that road.
What is this?
Help my wife.
Please. Help.
Sergeant Barnes?
Howard!
Howard!
No, Tony.
Did you know?
I didn't know it was him.
Don't bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know?
Yes.
Get out of here!
It wasn't him, Tony.
HYDRA had control of his mind!
Move!
It wasn't him!
Left bootjet failing.
Flight systems compromised.
Ah, crap.
He's not gonna stop. Go.
Come on, come on.
Targeting system's knackered, boss.
I'm eyeballing it.
Do you even remember them?
I remember all of them.
This isn't gonna change what happened.
I don't care.
He killed my mom.
You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
I almost killed the wrong man.
Hardly an innocent one.
This is all you wanted?
To see them rip each other apart.
My father lived outside the city.
I thought we would be safe there.
My son was excited.
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.
I told my wife, "Don't worry.
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."
When the dust cleared...
and the screaming stopped...
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.
My father...
still holding my wife and son in his arms.
And the Avengers?
They went home.
I knew I couldn't kill them.
More powerful men than me have tried.
But, if I could get them
to kill each other...
I'm sorry about your father.
He seemed a good man.
With a dutiful son.
Vengeance has consumed you.
It's consuming them.
I am done letting it consume me.
Justice will come soon enough.
Tell that to the dead.
The living are not done with you, yet.
You can't beat him hand-to-hand.
Analyse his fight pattern.
Scanning.
Countermeasures ready.
Let's kick his ass.
He's my friend.
So was I.
Stay down. Final warning.
I could do this all day.
That shield doesn't belong to you.
You don't deserve it.
My father made that shield!
Meals at 8 and 5.
Toilet privileges twice a day.
Raise your voice, zap.
Touch the glass, zap.
You step out of line, you deal with me.
Please, step out of line, hmm?
So how does it feel?
To spend all that time, all that effort...
to see it fail so spectacularly?
Did it?
- It's just the first pass.
- Yeah.
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.
Shock absorption, lateral movement.
Cup holder?
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...
Ow.
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
No. Don't help me.
Ah.
138 combat missions.
That's how many I've flown, Tony.
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.
Because the fight needed to be fought.
It's the same with these Accords.
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...
This is a bad beat.
But it hasn't changed my mind.
I don't think.
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.
Are you Tony Stank?
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.
Thank you for that!
Never dropping that, by the way.
"Table for one, Mr Stank.
"Please, by the bathroom."
Tony...
I'm glad you're back at the compound.
I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.
We all need family.
The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.
I've been on my own since I was 18.
I never really fit in anywhere,
even in the Army.
My faith's in people, I guess.
Individuals.
And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...
they haven't let me down.
Which is why I can't let them down either.
Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.
I know I hurt you, Tony.
I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...
I was sparing you...
but I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.
And I'm sorry.
Hopefully one day you can understand.
I wish we agreed on the Accords.
I really do.
I know you're doing what you believe in,
and that's all any of us can do.
That's all any of us should.
Priority call from Secretary Ross.
There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Yeah, put him through.
Tony, we have a problem.
- Uh, please hold.
- No, don't.
So no matter what...
I promise you...
if you need us...
if you need me...
I'll be there.
You sure about this?
I can't trust my own mind.
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...
I think going back under
is the best thing.
For everybody.
Thank you for this.
Your friend and my father...
they were both victims.
If I can help one of them find peace...
You know, if they find out he's here...
they'll come for him.
Let them try.
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
And flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
I tackle, we tussle
Oh, my days, we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt Single Action Army
Oh, no
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz
Girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh, my days
He disagrees
Oh, no
Speak easy
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Oh, no
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
And flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Oh, no
Who was it? Who hit you?
Some guy.
So itchy, man, God.
What's "some guy's" name?
Uh, Steve.
Steve? From 12-C?
- With the overbite?
- No, no, no.
You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.
Ouch.
Well...
I hope you got a few good licks in.
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.
His friend was huge. Like huge.
That's way better. Thank you.
Okay, tough guy.
Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door?

I'm kinda lonesome back here.
- Little help...
- Just... I have to keep my hands on the wheel.
Excuse me!
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?
Not the daffodil daydream. The girl.
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife. But...
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's
a reason I'm in this cab today.
- Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?
- No, my slender, brown friend. Love...
... is a beautiful thing. When you find it,
the whole world tastes like daffodil daydream.
So you gotta hold on to love. Tight!
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.
Sir, what does Ms Mama June taste like?
Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is it's bad.
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?
Oh, that's because it's Christmas day, Dopinder,
and I'm after someone on my naughty list.
I've been waiting, 1 year, 3 weeks, 6 days and---
14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.
- And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?
- This shit.
Boo!
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.
You're not the only
one with a war to win.
That won't do.
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.
We'd appreciate your patience.
Okay...
We'll deliver in full
the following month.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Fucking mutant!
Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!
That's $27.50.
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.
Merry Christmas!
And a convivial Tuesday
and April to you, Pool!
Oh! Oh, hello!
I know, right? Whose balls did I
have to fondle to get my very own movie?
I can't tell you, but it does rhyme
with "Pulverine". And lemme tell you...
He's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under!
Anyway. I got places to be.
A face to fix. And, oh!
Bad guys to kill.
Maximum effort.
Cock shot!
Rich! Corinthian leather!
I'm looking for Francis!
Have you seen this man?
Yanking, yanking!
I've never said this, but don't swallow.
Shit. Did I leave the stove on?
Now, breaking news.
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
Residents are advised to remain in their homes.
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...
Red suit. Deadpool.
Negasonic! Come. We have mission.
Colossus, wait up.
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?
Which benefits, the matching unitards?
The house that blows up every few years?
Please. House blowing up builds character.
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.
Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.
Deadpool may try to break yours.
Hey!
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!
Let's count 'em down!
Shit, motherfucker!
Ten! Shit.
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!
Bad Deadpool.
Seven. Good Deadpool!
Someone's not counting.
Six!
Four...
Gotcha!
Right up main street!
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.
I'm touching myself tonight.
Francis! Francis!
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?
You're not Francis!
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend said this was a
superhero movie but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kebab!"
Well, I may be super. But I'm no hero.
Anyhow, technically, this is a murder. But some
of the best love stories start with a murder.
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?
- Are you Mr. Merchant?
- The Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!
- Who placed the call?
- I did!
Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty!
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.
That is a no go on the tip-aroo, Jer.
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.
- I dodged a big-time bullet on that one!
- Not, out of the woods yet.
You need to seriously ease up on the
bedazzling. They're jeans, not a chandelier.
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.
- Just look, man, can I have my---
- I will shoot your fucking cat.
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?
Anywho...
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.
And little Megan, she's not made of
money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.
- I'm.....
- A stalker.
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?
Totally done. You should've seen your face!
- I didn't know what to do, I was so scared...
- Soft spot, remember?
Even look in her general direction again and you will learn
in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots, too.
That came out wrong.
Or did it?
Megan.
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.
No friggin' way.
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.
Hey, wait.
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.
Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies
except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.
You'd best hope we never
see your name on a gold card.
(Buck! Liefeld.)
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...
- Hey, I ain't taking any babysitting money,
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?
- You sure?
- Hmm.
For a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded.
Bet you let the kid off easy, too.
He's not a bad kid. Just a little light stalking. I was way
worse when I was his age, travelling to exotic places...
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,
meeting new and exciting people. And then..
Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your instagram.
So what were special forces doing in Jacksonville?
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.
I give you, a blowjob. I'm---
- Why do you make me make that?
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.
- Remind me what good will come of this?
- I don't take the shits, I just disturb them.
What you want?
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.
That's a new stool.
Stay the fuck down.
Alright, move, move, move, move.
Buck, go rest.
He's still breathing.
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.
You bet on me to die. Wow. Motherfucker,
you're the world's worst friend.
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.
And then die. At the city of Detroit.
Sorry. I wanted to win money.
I never win anything.
- Whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drink's on me!
- Yeah!
Domestic! Nothing imported.
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?
Tight.
- Vanessa.
- Wade.
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?
I'd hit that.
Buck, you'd best apologize
before--- yeah. That.
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.
- Breathe through the nose.
- I don't have a filter between my brain and my...
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!
- Get outta here. Go cast a spell.
- Hey, hands off the merchandise.
Merchandise, huh. So you...
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.
- Rough childhood?
- Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.
Daddy left before I was conceived.
- Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
- Where else do you put one out?
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.
- Uncles. They took turns.
- I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole
of a locked closet which also happens to be my...
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.
You had a dishwasher. I didn't even know sleep. It was
pretty much 24/7 ball kegs, brownie mix and clown porn.
Who would do such a thing?
Hopefully, you. Later tonight?
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.
And a low-fat dessert.
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?
It's time to put
balls in holes.
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.
- You love ski ball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
- That's a tough call.
I just wanna get to know the real you. Not the short-
shorted 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.
Balls in holes.
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.
Okay. Here you go.
I had this sucker for a while.
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.
You are now the proud protector of the planet Arus.
And you, can erase stuff. Written in pencil.
- Milady.
- I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.
How many more minutes
could I get for this?
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.
- 5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.
- Deal. What do we do with the remaining 2:37?
Cuddle?
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?
Happy Valentines' Day.
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.
Happy Lenten.
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!
Happy Thanksgiving.
I love you.
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...
Can I visit you
between the holidays?
That sweater is terrible!
But red looks good on you.
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?
Your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?
- You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.
- Right.
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.
Will you...
- Stick it up my---
- ...Marry me?
Uh... Jinx?
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.
- They said 1-month salary, so ...
- You mean...
- I do.
- That's my line.
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!
I feel just like a little girl!
- What if I just held on and never let go?
- Just ride the bitch's back like Yoda on Luke.
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!
Perfect.
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.
Here's the thing:
Life is an endless series of train wrecks with
only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness.
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.
There are certainly options we can look into.
New drugs are being developed every day.
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer and
there were all these experimental drugs from Germany...
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.
Me? I'm memorizing the details of her
face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?
Take your time to process this. It's
important not to do anything rash.
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?
"A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W.
Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."
"His form looks good."
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.
Ringing any bells? No?
How 'bout now?
Wade fucking Wilson.
- Well, hello, gorgeous.
- Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar Pei.
And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time
to undo what you did to this butter face.
You should thank me. Apparently, I've made
you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.
Dad?
I think we can all agree that shit just went
sideways in the most colossal way.
Well, maybe not the most.
Now this, is my most prized possession.
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.
Sounds like you have. Bernadette is not going
anywhere, because you're not going anywhere.
- Drink.
- You're right.
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.
You belong here at home. Surrounded by
your Voltron, and your Bernadette and your me.
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.
Not a good one, like Slapchop,
more Shakeweighty.
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.
We will make you better than better.
- A superhero.
- Look, Agent Smith, I tried the
hero business and it left a mark.
But if I ever hit fuck
-it, I'll look you up.
Oh. Shit.
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...
His drink's on him.
What'd he say?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.
They made 3 of those movies.
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.
But what it does to
the people you love.
Who knew if this guy could save my life? But I
knew there's only one way that I could save hers.
Isn't that what superheroes do?
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.
Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass, local dry
cleaning discounts, lucrative film deals,
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.
Con: they're all lame-ass teacher's pets!
- You know I can hear you.
- Wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them.
Stay right here. You've been
warned before, Deadpool.
This is a shameful and reckless use of your
powers. You will both be coming with us.
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the goody
two-shoes bullshit right now. And you are?
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
Negasonic Teenage---
What the shit?!
That's the coolest name ever!
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.
- Let me guess, X-Men left you behind
on what, shit detail?
- What does that make you?
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"
"I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen
silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences."
So what's it gonna be? Long, sullen
silence? Or mean comment? Go on.
- You got me in a box here.
- We can't allow this, Deadpool. Please, come quietly.
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.
That guy was already
up there when I got here.
- Wade, you are better than this. Join us,
use your powers for good.
- Heads up!
- Be a superhero.
- Listen! The day I decide to be a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,
who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland
Mansion of some creepy, old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker,
on that day, I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend
request. But until then, I'mma do what I came here to do.
- Either that, or slap the bitch out of you!
- Wade...
- Hey. Hey, Douchepool!
- Zip it, Sinead!
And I hope you're watching...
Quite unfortunate.
That does it!
Canada!
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.
Oh, your poor wife!
You really should stop.
All the dinosaurs fear the T-Rex.
- I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
- This is embarassing.
Please. Stay down.
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?
- Do you have 'off' switch?
- Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the 'on' switch?
Enough!
Let us go talk to the Professor.
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!
Oh my God. Nasty.
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
Rock, meet bottom.
When life ends up breathtakingly fucked, you can
generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.
This, well, this was mine.
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.
You've finally hit fuck-it.
- Just promise you'll do right by me.
So I can do right by someone else.
- Of course.
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.
And Jesus! A warmer table.
You should really come up with a safe
word, fellas. I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.
Easy!
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?
I'm calling Wang.
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?
- Patience, Angel. All in good time.
- Are you here for the turn down service or what?
- We have another talker.
- I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.
Shut the fuck up.
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."
But I'm going blunt. This workshop
is not a government-led program.
It's a private institution that turns reclamation
projects like yourself into men of....
Extraordinary abilities.
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly... Wrong.
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates
any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, I hope.
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, also scorched
my nerve endings so I no longer feel pain.
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.
Thank-- thank you! You
have something in your teeth.
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.
It's been bothering
me for a long time.
Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name,
because it sounds suspiciously made up.
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Faulty?
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is your sense of humor.
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.
- He's all yours.
- C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?
This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum, so we're gonna have to make you suffer.
If you're lucky, your mutant genes will
activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion.
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.
Until you finally mutate...
... or die.
- You mean like a bucket list?
- Like a fuck it list, I'd like to light a
spiff off the Olympic torch.
Acid to me, right after.
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...
Vanessa...
I wanna see Vanessa.
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.
- We're just joking.
- No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions.
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.
F-R-A-N-C-I--- oops!
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.
Why don't you do us all a favor and shut
the fuck up? Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
See, here's the problem with round-the-clock
torture, it's that you can't really step it up from there.
Is that what you think?
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.
What we're gonna do is lower the oxygen concentration in
the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
If your brain wave's slowing and you're about
to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2.
If your heart rate slows meaning you're able
to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down.
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?
You still think we're
making you a superhero.
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.
And that's what they'll have you doing. Terrorizing
citizens, putting down freedom fighters.
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.
Wait, wait, wait...
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.
- What have you done to me?
- I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
Striking your cancer as fast as it can form.
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.
But where's the fun in that?
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.
Not because I need to.
Because I want to.
Farewell. Go ahead.
You already smell like shit.
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...
I think we have earned that one.
You take off. Go on, off you go.
Quick question:
What's my name?
Didn't think so.
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!
What's my name?
Wade...
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.
- She doesn't care what you--- Oh!
- Do you like what you see?
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.
Not gently. He was hate-fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship and that was their only catharsis without violence.
And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the British
shitstick who ran the mutant factory. And he's gone--- Poof!
You gotta do something to remedy this. 'Cause
as of now, you only have one course of action:
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror fims.
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.
Here's what I'm actually gonna do:
I'm gonna work thru his crew until somebody gives up Francis,
force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,
- the douchebag does think you're dead, right?
- Yeah.
- That's good. You should keep it that way.
- What, like, wear a mask?
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.
- That'll do.
- What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...
- ... or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie. Oh, shit.
- What?
- I put all my money on you, and now I
just realized I'm never gonna win the....
- Deadpool...
Captain Deadpool.
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.
To you, Mr. Pool. Deadpool. That
sounds like a fuckin' franchise.
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it!
Where's Francis?
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!
Don't make me ask twice.
Where is Francis?
He made me ask twice.
Is the mask muffling my voice?
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!
- No, please...
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
Little spider-monkey!
This is confusing! Is it sexist to hit you, is it
more sexist to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!
Donde esta Francesca?
Tell me where your fucking boss is!
Or you're gonna die! In 5 minutes!
Nice to see you, Jared. I'll
take a foot long. Fully loaded.
- 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89, about to be 90.
- Mr. Wilson?
- You're looking very alive.
- Hah! Only on the outside.
- This is not going to end---
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.
- Where's your boss?
- I can tell you exactly where---
You'll tell me. But first, you might wanna look
away for this. Now this little piggy went to...
Thank you, Agent Smith.
Taxi!
Hop in! Great day for a ride.
And we all know
how this turned out.
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.
There. All caught up.
Sorry! About bleeding
at all your garbage.
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.
Like the kind where your year-long plan
ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.
Morning, sleepyhead.
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.
- Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.
- You mean my big, rubber, masturbating shoes?
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?
Bactine should do it.
How's that () coming along? Ikea
doesn't assemble itself, you know.
You're telling me. I don't mind the ().
It's an improvement on the ().
Anything's an improvement over the ().
I'd taken an () or a () over the ().
No, I didn't get
excited 'till I saw ().
- Screw, please.
- Here? Now? Just kidding. I know it's been decades.
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.
Ta------da...
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.
And I quote, "Looking for roommate, blind, and likes imperfections. Must be good with hands." Or would you rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?
- Why such a douche this morning?
- Let's recap:
The cock-fizzle that turned me into this
freak slipped through my arms today.
Arm.
Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super
-sexy ex back and prevent this from happening to someone else.
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.
#drive-by.
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.
I only wish I'd heal the same.
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.
- Right. And when he heals?
- He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.
- Tylenol PM?
- It sticks back where you stuck the Bactine.
I raided my stash of wisdom just to take a sec
and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.
But I appreciate the gesture.
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?
About the size of a KFC spork.
I get why you're so pissy, but your mood's never gonna
brighten 'till you find this woman and tell her how you feel.
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. McGoo? She wouldn't
have me. If you could see me, you'd understand.
- Looks aren't everything.
- Looks are everything! Ever heard David Beckham speak?
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium. You think
Ryan Reynolds got this far on a superior acting method?
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...
You're blind.
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this arm plows through puberty
and then I'll come up with a whole, new Christmas day plan.
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.
Go, go, go, go, go...
So the doctor says, the bad news is you don't have
that long to live. So the patient says, how long do I have?
The doctor says, five.
The guys says, five what?
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...
Can I help you ladies?
Oh, I do hope so.
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.
Name of Wade Wilson.
Sorry, I don't know the name.
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.
- I've seen this girl.
- This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around. This
isn't really the place to do something like that.
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?
There's a midnight showing of Blade II.
Thanks for having my back, guys.
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, and by we, I mean you.
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?
"Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!
- Or as I like to call her, Irony.
- I gotta find her fast, before numb nuts does.
- How do you know she's in here?
- Some customer stalking that fox.
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.
Especially from this angle.
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.
You weak motherfucker!
C'mon. Get it together, this isn't
about you, this is about Vanessa.
Here we go.
Maximum effort.
Vanessa!
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about... an old boyfriend?
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.
Like a jigsaw puzzle.
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
- Hey, where did she go?
- I saw her head to the back. Go get her, tiger.
Motherfucker!
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate---
- Jiminy---- Fuck! Fuck!
- We can talk... or you can hit that...
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking-- find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd with the smiling face and
the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the () but this is holding my interest.
- I told you, we're going with the (), not the (),
get it thru your head or get outta Fucktown!
- Shit.
- That's all the pieces in the house.
- No, no, no, come on. Let's go. Cough it up.
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.
25 cal. I like it.
Wade...
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.
Oh, listen, Al...
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere
in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness.
Good luck.
You wanna get fucked up?
Put her down over here.
Go on, then.
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.
I've been trying to tell you assholes you
got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.
- Fake laugh! Hiding real pain! Go get Silver balls.
- You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you. It s almost
like, the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.
My chrome-penised friend back there, has agreed to do me this
solid. In exchange, I said I would consider joining his boy band.
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.
- So, any luck winning Gita back?
- I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool, but Bandu
is more craftier and handsomer than me.
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.
He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, DP, I plan to gut
him like a tandoori fish then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)
He's super dead.
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.
Not often a dude ruins your face, skullstomps your sanity, grabs your baby mama and personally sees thru 4 of your 5 shittiest moments.
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.
Hey, where's your duffel bag?
Goddammit! We'll do this the old-
fashioned way. With two swords..
... and maximum effort.
Cue the music.
Wade Wilson!
- What's my name?
- Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for 'ya.
- Go get some.
- Superhero landing. She's gonna
do a superhero landing, wait for it!
Superhero landing! You know, that's really hard
on your knees. Totally impractical, they all do it.
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please----
I mean, that's why I brought her?
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.
Go get her, tiger.
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.
Alright then. Fire!
Finish fucking her the fuck off!
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!
Look away, child. Look away!
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.
So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle, possibly...
... even lover-like treatment.
Fine! Commando!
Teabag!
- Bob?
- Wade?
- Oh my God, I haven't seen you since, TGIFridays!
- Jacksonville. Fridays.
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is she still
fixing that tuna casserole? It's so good, but bad for...
- Your... on the left... You are beautiful...
- That is so sweet! Thanks!
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.
Fire!
Hey! Climb on.
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.
- You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.
- Wade?
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.
- What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.
- Oh, you never left.
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.
Well I hope they've blocked pain to your
every last nerve. 'Cause I'mma go looking!
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.
When I'm finished, what's left to grow back you?
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.
- Fine. Fists.
- Sounds like your last Saturday night.
Asshole!
- Hang in there, baby. I got you.
- Wade!
I got a plan. You're
not gonna like it.
Shit, shit, shit!
Don't worry! I'm
totally on top of this.
Dammit! Maximum effort!
Thanks.
Just take it slow.
Oh, my God! That was so awe---
- Me and you, are headed
to fix this butter face!
- What?
You sure are a fucking idiot.
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?
- What?
- You heard me.
No, no!
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?
Any last words?
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!
Wade!
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?
- Four or five moments, that's all it takes.
- To...?
Be a hero.
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero.
Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true.
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.
Moments when you're offered a choice.
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...
... spare an enemy.
In these moments, everything else falls away.
The way the world sees us.
The way we---
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.
I can't even tell you... I deserve that...
that too.. No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.
Start talking!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,
- I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner...
It's been a rough couple of years.
- Rough?
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...
Every night we spoon for warmth, everybody
fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.
So you live in a house?
I should've come
and found you sooner.
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.
You made this mask?
And this one. In case
the other fell off.
Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Hey...
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..
It's a face...
I'd be happy to sit on.
But I'm not the same underneath
this suit either. Super-penis.
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.
What are you still doing ---- Get
outta here, go make yourself useful.
You, go be a really big brother to someone.
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.
And you, chicken noodle. Nothing
Compares 2 U. Sinead O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.
- That's all right. You're cool.
- What in the ass?
- That was not mean! I'm proud of you!
- We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.
You know, for a second there, it felt like we were 3 mini
lion robots coming together to form one super robot.
- This was stupid.
- Yeah.
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.
Come here.
WHAM! As promised.
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, here we go...
Looks nice, not gonna be the only thing that's pulling out tonight.
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh? Until next
time, this is your friendly neighborhood Pool guy singing...
You're still here.
It's over! Go home!
Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.
What were you expecting, Sam Jackson'll
show up? Eye patch? Saucy leather? Go, go.
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.
In the sequel, we're gonna have Cable. Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time-travel. We have no idea who to cast yet,
but it could be anybody. Just
take a big guy with a flat top.
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley.
She's got range, who knows? Anyway, big secret.
And don't leave your garbage rotting
around. It's a total dick move. Go.

There's a girl in this harbor town.

It will be here any minute.
Which will be its loss.
I thought your thing was a sword?
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?
It hurts.
It hurts?
I have sensitive nipples.
(ROCKET LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"
What about him? What's he doing?
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.
How is that a priority?
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.
That's hardly important right now.
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.
No, seriously, I side with Drax.
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.
I can clearly see you winking.
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

He said the skin is too thick

Skin is the same level of thickness

I realize that.

What?
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)
What are they called again?
Anulax batteries.
Harbulary batteries.
That's nothing like what I just said.
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.
The cost of transgression is death.
AYESHA: We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.
Impeccable,
both physically and mentally.
We control the DNA of our progeny...
germinating them in birthing pods.
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.
Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.
For academic purposes.
I would be honored, yes.
In the name of research...
I think that could be pretty, uh...
repulsive.
I'm not into that kind of casual...
Oh, please.
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.
Bring it...
and we shall gladly be on our way.
(GRUNTS)
Family reunion. Yay.
I understand she is your sister.
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.
Do with her as you please.
(NEBULA GRUNTS)
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?
My mother is from Earth.
And your father?
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.
I see it within you.
An unorthodox genealogy.
A hybrid that seems particularly...
reckless.
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...
- but that isn't true at all.
- (CROWD GASPS)
ROCKET: Oh, shit.
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?
I'm sorry. That was meant to be

That stuff about my father...
Who does she think she is?
I know you're sensitive about that.
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.
I wasn't.
I don't care if you were.
Well, I feel like you do care.
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
Damn shadow.
There are two types of beings
in the universe...
those who dance, and those who do not.
Mmm-hmm.
I first met my beloved at a war rally.
Oh, God.
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.
Except one woman.
My Ovette.
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.
She wouldn't even tap her foot.
Wouldn't move a muscle.
One might assume she was dead.
That does sound pretty hot.
It would make
my nether regions engorge.
Okay. I get it, yes.
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.
Mmm.
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.
No. It's not ripe yet...
and I hate you.
You hate me?
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.
And yet here you stand, a hero.
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.
I swear.
No.
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days
in a prison on Xandar...
wishing you could.
- (GRUNTS)
- (ALARM BLARING)
QUILL: This is weird.
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.
GAMORA: Why would they do that?
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.
Dude!
Right.
He didn't steal some of those.
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.
- (QUILL GRUNTS)
- (GAMORA YELPS)
(WHIMPERS)
(GRUNTS)
What were you thinking?
Dude, they were really easy to steal!
- That's your defense?
- Come on!
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!
I was being sarcastic!
Oh, no!
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!
Now I look foolish!
Can we put the bickering on hold...
until after we survive
this massive space battle?
QUILL: More incoming!
ROCKET: Good!
I wanna kill some guys!
(ROCKET YELLING)
(CONTINUES YELLING)
GAMORA: You're not killing anyone.
All those ships are remotely piloted.
(GRUNTS)
Damn it!
(EXCITED CHATTER)
What is the delay, Admiral?
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...
and could destroy the entire fleet.
Our concern is their slight
against our people.
We hired them and they steal from us.
It is heresy of the highest order.
All command modules...
fire with the intent to kill.
(GRUNTS)
What's the nearest habitable planet?
It's called Berhert.
- How many jumps?
- Only one.
But the access point is 47 clicks away.
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.
Quill, to make it through that...
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.
Lucky for us, I...
I am.
ROCKET: What are you doing?
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!
Stop it.
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...
and there's gonna be something squishy
in your pillow case.
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.
Oh, it won't be my turd.
It will be Drax's.

What?
Who?

- What is that?
- Who cares?

GAMORA: Look at this!
Where is the other half of our ship?
QUILL: My ship.
GAMORA: Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field...
had you flown with
what's between your ears
instead of what's between your legs!
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.
More like because he stole...
the Anulax batteries!
They're called Harbulary batteries.
No, they're not!
Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."
I did it because I wanted to!
Dick.
What are we even talking about this for?
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!
How little?
Well, I don't know, like this?
A little one-inch man saved us?
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.
Don't call me a raccoon!
I'm sorry. I took it too far.
I meant trash panda.
Is that better?
I don't know.
It's worse. It's so much worse.
You son of a...
Hey!
ROCKET: I've had it with you!
QUILL: No! Back up!
NEBULA: Someone followed you
through the jump point.
Set me free, you'll need my help.
I'm not a fool, Nebula.
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
No, I won't.
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.
I bet it's the one-inch man.
After all these years, I've found you.
And who the hell are you?
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.
My name is Ego...

TULLK: Yondu!
Come on down!
STAKAR: After going around
years in circles...
with this woman I end up marrying.
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...
"but you're losing your mind!"
Then again, she's always been that way.
I could never trust her. You know?
Stakar.
It's been some time.
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.
- Sir!
- Stakar!
STAKAR: There's a hundred
Ravager factions.
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.
Please, sir. Please!
Get away from me.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
(GROWLS)
You can go to hell then!
I don't give a damn what you think of me!
So what are you following us for?
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!
Ravagers don't deal in kids.
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!
You didn't know because
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.
I demand a seat at the table!
I wear these flames, same as you.
You may dress like us...
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.
And the Colors of Ogord...
will never flash over your grave.
If you think...
I take pleasure in exiling you...
you're wrong.
You broke all our hearts.
Ah, pathetic.
First, Quill betrays us...
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.
We followed him
because he was the one...
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.
Seems he's goin' soft.
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?
You know I'm right, Kraglin.
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.
RAVAGER: Who the hell is that?
(GRUNTING)
(SIGHS)
Yondu Udonta...
I have a proposition for you.
EGO: I hired Yondu to pick you up...
when your mother passed away.
But instead of returning you...
Yondu kept you.
I have no clue as to why.
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because I was a skinny little kid
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.
It made it easier for thievin'.
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.
DRAX: I thought Yondu was your father.
What? We've been together
this whole time...
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?
You look exactly alike.
One's blue!
No, he's not my father!
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.
- Eat you?
- Yeah.
Oh, that son of a bitch.
How'd you locate us now?
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.
What say we head out there right now?
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.
I promise you...
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.
And there...
I can explain your very special heritage.
Finally get to be...
the father I've always wanted to be.
Excuse me.
I've gotta take a whiz.
I'm not buying it.
Let's go take a walk.
- (WHISTLING)
- (URINATING)
I am Mantis.
What are you doing?
Smiling.
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.
Not if you do it like that.
Oh...
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.
Yes.

After all this time,
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...
- you wanna be my dad?
- GAMORA: I hear you.
QUILL: And by the way,
this could be a trap.
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...
But what?
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?
Who?
He owned a magic boat?
David Hasselhoff?
Right.
Not a magic boat. A talking car.
Why did he talk again?
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...
and you would tell
all the other children...
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?
I love that story.
- I hate that story.
- (SIGHS)
It's so sad!
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!
That's my point, Peter.
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?
If he ends up being evil...
we will just kill him.
You're leaving me with that fox?
GAMORA: He's not a fox.
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.
(GRUMBLES)
- Or if you feel like it.
- ROCKET: Okay.
It'll be just a couple of days.
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
DRAX: What if the Sovereign come?
QUILL: There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.
I'm uncertain about parting ways.
God, you're like an old woman.
Because I'm wise?
GAMORA: Why do you have
so much luggage?
DRAX: I don't want Groot
playing with my things.
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?
Because it's working.
(FLEETWOOD MAC'S

And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again.
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain.
And if you don't love me now.
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying.
You would never break the chain.
And if you don't love me now.
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying.
You would never break the chain
(DRAX AND QUILL LAUGHING)
QUILL: Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?
Oh...
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.
Your antennae, what are they for?
Their purpose?
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!
I say...
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.
QUILL: Right.
And if it's anything other than...
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.
They are not for feeling doorways.
- (SIGHS)
- (QUILL LAUGHS)
I think...
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.
What are those?
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.
- You read minds?
- No.
Telepaths know thoughts.
Empaths feel feelings.
Emotions.
May I?
All right.
You feel love.
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.
No!
Romantic, sexual love.
No, I don't.
- For her!
- No!
(LAUGHING)
QUILL: Okay.
(QUILL GROANS)
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!
You must be so embarrassed!
(DRAX CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Do me! Do me!
I have never felt such humor!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
So unbelievably uncool.
- Oh, Quill.
- (CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.
I can also alter emotions to some extent.
QUILL: Yeah, like what?
If I touch someone who is sad...
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.
I can make a stubborn person compliant.
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.
Do one of those on me.
Sleep.

Hey there, rat!
How's it going, you blue idiot?
Not so bad.
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...
has offered us a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...
because she wants
- to kill y'all.
- (ALL LAUGHING)
Your friend...
There's too many of them.
He needs my help.
If you care about him...
you need to get me out of these bonds.
They are going to kill him!
YONDU: I tell you,
it was pretty easy to find you.
I put a tracer on your ship back there...
during the war over Xandar.
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
(CHUCKLES) Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
Otherwise, you'd what?
We'll take them batteries.
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?
That Priestess offered us a million.
A quarter is only one third of that!
A quarter ain't a third.
A quarter is 25.
No.
GEF: We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.
YONDU: Enough!
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.

I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...
you protect him like
none of the rest of us much matter!

No larger than your Earth's Moon.
Humility.
I like it.
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.
(LAUGHING)
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.
What are you exactly?
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.
A Celestial, like a god?
Mmm, small "g," son.
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.
(EGO CHUCKLING)
QUILL: Whoa!
I don't know where I came from exactly.
First thing I remember is flickering...
adrift in the cosmos utterly...
and entirely alone.
Over millions of years...
I learned to control
the molecules around me.
I grew smarter and stronger.
And I continued building from there...
layer by layer...
the very planet you walk on now.
Whoa.
But I wanted more.
I desired...
meaning.
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...
"besides just me," I thought.
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.
I created...
what I imagined biological life
to be like...
down to the most minute detail.
Did you make a penis?
Dude!
What is wrong with you?
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?
He would smush her!
(QUILL GROANS)
I don't need to hear how my parents...
Why?
My father would tell the story
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.
That's disgusting.
It was beautiful.
You Earthers have hang-ups.
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.
Ha! Thank you!
It's not half bad.
- Oh.
- Ugh.
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...
and all the accompanying junk.
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...
as I set out amongst the stars...
until I found...
what I sought.
Life.
I was not alone in the universe after all.
When did you meet my mother?
Not long after.
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.
I called her my river lily.
And from that love, Peter...
you.
I have searched for you for so long.
And when I heard of a man from Earth...
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

- (ALL SNICKERING)

- Scrotum Hat?
- (ALL LAUGHING)

Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.
That's enough killing for today.
(RAVAGERS MURMURING)
RAVAGER: She's the daughter
of Thanos.
TASERFACE: I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.
I assure you...
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...
or a talking woodland beast.
I want 10% of the take...
and a couple more things.
KRAGLIN: We got
a whole box of hands...
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.
What are you gonna do with your share?
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me
battle one another in training.
Every time my sister prevailed...
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.
But she won...
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.
So after I murder my sister...
I will buy a warship
with every conceivable
instrument of death.
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...
piece by piece...
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...
I know every single day.
Yeah.
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.
Or a nice hat.
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"
Anyways, happy trails.
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.
Peter...
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.
But you left...
the most wonderful woman ever...
to die alone.
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...
and the light within it...
this form will wither and perish.
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?
I loved your mother, Peter!
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!
I know exactly what that feels like!
I had to watch her die!
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...
I've made many mistakes, Peter.
But you're not one of them.
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...
and the light within.
They are a part of you, Peter.
What do you mean?
Give me your hands, son.
Here.
Hold them like that.
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.
(QUILL EXHALES DEEPLY)
(GASPS)
Yes!
Whoa!
Yes! It's okay.
Just relax. Concentrate.
You can do it. Bring it back.
Yes!
Yes, now shape it.
Feel that energy.
Yes.
You're home.
Peter...
DRAX: How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?
MANTIS: Ego found me
in my larva state.
Orphaned on my homeworld.
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.
So you're a pet?
I suppose.
People usually want cute pets.
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?
I am hideous?
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.
But that's a good thing.
Oh?
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...
you know they love you for who you are.
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.
DRAX: Those pools,
they remind me of a time...
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.
She was like you.
Disgusting?
Innocent.
(SOBS)
(SIGHS)
Drax?
There's something I must tell you.
What's going on?
This gross bug lady is my new friend.
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.
You're not ugly. Drax!
What are you talking about?
GAMORA: Mantis...
can you show us where we'll be staying?
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?
MANTIS: The planet is Ego.
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.
And you're not a flea?
I'm a flea with a purpose.
I help him sleep.
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?
Nothing.
Your quarters are this way.
(BOTH GRUNT)
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.
Okay, Taserface.
Hey, tell the other guys we said...
"Hi," Taserface!
(SIGHS)
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?
No, Gef.
It's too adorable to kill.
Take it to the tailor.
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.
But I was young...
and greedy, and stupid.
Like you stealing those batteries.
That was mostly Drax.
Me and Stakar and the other captains...
we weren't so different from
you and your friends.
The only family I ever had.
When I broke the code...
they exiled me.
This is what I deserve.
Slow down, drama queen.
You might deserve this, but I don't.
We gotta get outta here.
Where's Quill?
He went off with his old man.
- Ego?
- Yeah.
It's a day for dumbass names.
(CHUCKLES)
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.
You like a professional asshole or what?
Pretty much a pro.
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?
He was skinny.
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.
Uh-huh.
I got an idea on how to get outta here.
But we're gonna need your little friend.

Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...
the thing I wore on my head.
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.
You got it?
(RAVAGERS SNORING)
That's my underwears.
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.
You have to explain it more careful.
It's a prototype fin.
(SCREECHING)
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.
You explain it this time.
All right.
YONDU: That's Vorker's eye.
He takes it out when he sleeps.
Go. Look again.
But leave the eye here.
Why?
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...
and he's not gonna know...
where his eye is! (LAUGHING)
That's a desk.
We told you it was this big.
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...
with a bunch of severed human toes.
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.
Okay?
What? No!
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.
That's not what I said!
I am Groot.
He's relieved you don't want him to.
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.
I am Groot.
On anyone, not just himself.
I am Groot.
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.
That's why you don't like hats?
This is an important conversation
right now?

It doesn't feel right.
What are you talking about?
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!
That girl Mantis...
she's afraid of something.
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?
I'm not trying...
He's my father. He's blood.
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.
Again, you made me come here!
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?
That's the half I'm worried about.
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.
You were insufferable to begin with.
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...
to open themselves up
to new possibility,
and the other person is a jerk...
who doesn't trust anybody!
It's a show that doesn't exist.
That's why it would get zero ratings!
I don't know what Cheers is!
I finally found my family.
Don't you understand that?
I thought you already had.

I win.
I win. I bested you in combat.
No. I saved your life.
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.
You let me live!
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!
I'm not the one that just
flew across the universe
just because I wanted to win.
Do not tell me what I want.
I don't need to tell you what you want!
It's obvious!
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!
You were all I had.
But you were the one
who needed to win.
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...
and my brain from my skull...
and my arm from my body...
because of you.
(NEBULA SIGHS)
(LOOKING GLASS' "BRANDY
(YOU'RE A FINE GIRL)" PLAYING)
You all right, son?
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.
Yeah. (SIGHS)
It's fortuitous...
you listening to this song.
- You know...
- Brandy?
By Looking Glass?
(CHUCKLES) A favorite of your mom's.
Yeah, it was.
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.
Perhaps its very greatest.
Yes!
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.
He came on a summer's day.
Bringing gifts from far away.
Like the child I put in your mother...
or the freedom you brought Gamora.
Brandy, you're a fine girl.
What a good wife you would be.
My life, my love.
My lady is the sea.
The sea calls the sailor back.
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...
No, Peter...
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...
as long as the light
burns within the planet.
I'm immortal?
Mmm-hmm.
Really?
Yes! As long as the light exists.
And I can use the light
to build cool things...
like how you made this whole planet?
It might take you
a few million years of practice...
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!
What!
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...
and Heather Locklear.
You can do anything you want.
I'm gonna make some weird shit.
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.
Only we can remake the universe.
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...
and lead it to where it needs to go.
How?
Come with me.
(GASPS)
(SNORING)
Drax, Drax. Drax!
Drax! We need to talk.
I'm sorry.
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.
What?
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.
No, that's not what I...
(RETCHING)
What are you doing?
I'm imagining being with you physically.
Drax...
I don't like you like that.
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.
Hey! There's no need to get personal.
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.
I should have told you earlier.
I'm stupid. You are in danger.
(BOTH PANTING)
What is that?
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.
Everything around us,
including the girl...
Everything is temporary.
We are forever.
Doesn't eternity get boring?
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...
which is why you're here.
I told you how all those years ago...
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...
it was all so...
disappointing.
And that is when I came...
to a profound realization.
My innate desire to seek out other life...
was not so that I could
walk among that life.
Peter...
I have found meaning.
(GASPING)
I see it.
Eternity!
Oh, my God.
We need to get off this planet.
(ALL SCREAMING)
Oh, man.
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.
(ALL SCREAMING)
(BOTH GROAN)
What the hell you doing, boy?
I could tell

this Ego is bad news.
We're here to save Quill.
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?
No. I don't care about those things.
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!
I can lord this over him forever.
(LAUGHING)
What are you laughing at me for?
You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.
I know who you are.
You don't know anything
about me, loser.
I know everything about you.
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.
Shut up!
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...
because just a little bit of love...
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.
I said shut up!
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.
I'm serious, dude!
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...
their own little baby, into slavery.
I know who you are, boy.
Because you're me.
What kind of a pair are we?
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.
All right, okay! Good. Wait.
Fight a what?
(GAMORA YELLS)
Who are you people?
What is this place?
Gamora, let her go!
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?
You are scared.
(MANTIS COUGHING)
I call it the Expansion.
It is my purpose...
and now it is yours as well.
It's beautiful.
Over thousands of years...
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...
on thousands of worlds.
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...
To grow and spread...
covering all that exists...
until everything is...
Me!
What did she do to me?
She already told me everything.
I only had one problem.
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power
for such an enterprise.
But two Celestials...
Well, now, that just might do.
The bodies...
are his children.
EGO: Out of all my labors...
the most beguiling was...
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...
to power the Expansion.
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.
It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.
But one after the other, they failed me.
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.
Until you, Peter.
Out of all my spawn...
only you carried
the connection to the light.
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.
- Then we just go.
- No!
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.
You're right.
We're family.
We leave no one behind.
Except maybe you.
Oh, my God.
For the first time in my existence...
I am truly not alone!
What is it, son?
My friends.
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.
Yes.
We are beyond such things.
Yes.
- Now...
- But my mother...
You said you loved my mother.
And that I did.
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.
And I knew if I returned a fourth...
I'd never leave.
The Expansion...
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.
So, I did what I had to do.
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.
What?
Now, all right...
I know that sounds bad.
(GROANING)
Who in the hell do you think you are?
You killed my mother!
I tried...
so hard...
to find the form...
that best suited you...
and this is the thanks I get?
You really need to grow up.
- (GASPS)
- I wanted to do this together...
but I suppose you'll have to learn
by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!
(TRANSMITTER BEEPING)
Finally! Rocket?
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.
We're in an old piece of construction

to slice open the Bank of A 'askavaria.

(BABY GROOT GRUNTING)
I told you something didn't feel right.
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.
Well, I came back, didn't I?
Because there's an unspoken thing.
There is no unspoken thing.
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?
We had it under control.
We did not.
That is only an extension...
of his true self.
He will be back soon.
What's Smurfette doing here?
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.
She tried to murder me!
I saved you, you stupid fox!
He's not a fox.
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.
I am Groot.
"Raccoon." Whatever.
How do we kill a Celestial?
There's a center to him.
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...
Some sort of protective shell.
It's in the caverns...
below the surface.
- Yondu?
- (GRUNTS)
(QUILL GRUNTS)

Thrusters are out.

I was a skinny kid.
Otherwise, you'd have

You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?
That's what you told me, you old doofus.
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.
You said you were gonna eat me.
That was being funny!
Not to me!
You people have issues.
Of course I have issues.
That's my freakin' father!
Thrusters are back up.
(EGO YELLING)
(ALL GRUNT)
- We should be going up!
- QUILL: We can't!
Ego wants to eradicate

We have to kill him.
Rocket!
Got it!
QUILL: Whoo-hoo!
So, we're saving the galaxy again?
I guess.
Awesome!
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...
if we're two-time galaxy savers.
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...
and all the animals on the planets.
And the people.
Meh.

Tell me why Ego wants you here?
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...
to help destroy the universe.
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.
So, could you?
A little.
I made a ball.
A ball?
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.
You "thought"?
You think when I make this arrow fly...
- I use my head?

Why aren't you firing the lasers?
They blew out the generator.
I think I packed a small detonator.
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.
Well, we got these.
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...
throughout his entire nervous system.
Meaning what?
The entire planet will explode.
We'll have to get out of here fast.
I rigged a timer.
QUILL: Go!
(QUILL GRUNTING)
He's coming.
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?
When he wants. He's too powerful.
I can't!

I never thought she'd be able to do it...
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.
I don't know how long I can hold him.
ROCKET: The metal's too thick.
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.
QUILL: Well...
That's a terrible idea.
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.
(GROANS) Unbelievable.
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."
(SIGHS) What a day.
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.
That activates it.
Then you push this button...
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.
Now, whatever you do...
don't push this button...
because that will set off
the bomb immediately
and we'll all be dead.
Now, repeat back what I just said.
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.
- I am Groot.
- That's right.
- I am Groot.
- No!
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!
Try again.
Hmm...
- I am Groot.

No! That's exactly what you just said!
How is that even possible?
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?
Point to it.
No!
QUILL: Hey, you're
making him nervous!
Shut up and get me some tape!
Does anybody have any tape out there?
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.
I don't have any tape. Let me check.
Yo, Yondu... Ow!
Do you have any tape?
(QUILL GROANING)
Gamora? Do you have any tape?
Tape!
Never mind. Ow!
Drax, do you have any tape?
- (ROCKET COUGHS)
- Yes, Scotch tape would work.
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,
if you don't have any?
Nobody has any tape!
Not a single person has tape?
Nope!
Did you ask Nebula?
Yes!
Are you sure?
I asked Yondu...
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!
You are wasting a lot of time here!
Whee!
We're all gonna die.
YONDU: Rear thrusters are out again!
- We're done for without that generator!

perhaps it will provide you solace...
that your deaths

She's just unconscious.
How long until the bomb goes off?
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...
about six minutes.

QUILL: I told Gamora...
how when I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.
Earlier, it struck me...
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.
He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...
but he did have the whistle of one.
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...
and hooked up with hot women...
and fought robots.
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.
Only it was you, Yondu.
I had a pretty cool dad.
What I'm trying to say here is...
sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...
it's right there by your side all along.
You don't even know it.
(SNIFFLES)
I am Groot.
He did call you twig.
Nebula...
I was a child like you.
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.
I'm trying to make it right.
There are little girls like you...
across the universe who are in danger.
You can stay with us and help them.
I will help them by killing Thanos.
I don't know if that's possible.
(NEBULA GASPS)

Said you'd come back

It's called a Zune.
It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.
It's got 300 songs on it.

I think Yondu would want you to have it.

playing that mind-numbing game.
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!
I'm not boring!
I am Groot.
And now I know how Yondu felt.
HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...
just remember...
We. Are. Groot.
Hey, fellas.
Wait, where are you going?
You were supposed to be my lift home.
How will I get out of here?
Hey! Aw, gee...
I've got so many more stories to tell.
Aw, guys.
Oh, gee...

Now, I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"
Well, sometimes you have to get captured
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.
See, I spent some time on Earth...
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.
Then I went searching through the Cosmos
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.
Didn't find any.
That's when I came across
a path of death and destruction,
which led me all the way here
into this cage,
where I met you.
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?
Thor, son of Odin.
Surtur, son of a bitch.
You're still alive.
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.
I cannot die.
Not until I fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home.
It's funny you should mention that.
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.
And you, Surtur,
are at the center of all of them.
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.
Hang on.
I'll be back around shortly.
I really feel like
we were connecting there.
Okay, so Ragnarok.
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.
My time has come.
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame,
I shall be restored to my full might.
I will tower over the mountains,
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...
Hang on. Give it a second.
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.
I'm really sorry.
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame
and then you'll suddenly grow as big
as a house?
A mountain!
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
locked away on Asgard?
Odin is not on Asgard.
And your absence has left the throne
defenseless.
Okay, so where is it? This crown?
This is my crown,
the source of my power.
Oh, that's a crown.
I thought it was a big eyebrow.
It's a crown.
Anyway, it sounds like
all I have to do to stop Ragnarok
is rip that thing off your head.
But Ragnarok has already begun.
You cannot stop it.
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.
All will suffer, all will burn.
That's intense.
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.
But it looks like I'm gonna have to
choose option B,
where I bust out of these chains,
knock that tiara off your head,
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.
You cannot stop Ragnarok.
Why fight it?
Because that's what heroes do.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.
And, now!
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.
I make grave mistakes all the time.
Everything seems to work out.
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,
but I could really use a fast exit.
Heimdall?
Heimdall was an idiot.
This job should have made him rich.
Now, the job ain't easy
but it does have its benefits.
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.
Behold...
My stuff.
I'm particularly fond of these.
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard
called Texas.
I even named them. Des and Troy.
You see, when you put them together,
they destroy.
Heimdall, come on.
Stay!
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.
Heimdall?
Skurge?
Is that important?
You girls are in for a treat.
Girls!
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.
Thanks for scaring away my company
and drenching my workplace in brains.
Who are you?
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
We fought together on Vanaheim.
Right. Where is Heimdall?
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.
Traitor?
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall
with negligence of duty
but he disappeared before the trial.
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.
Sure.
Hold on.
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.
What the hell is that?
Oh, brother. This is it.
I take my leave.
You fool, you didn't listen!
I'm sorry.
Lady Sif, get help!
Somebody, help!
Sorry for all I've done.
It's all right. Hold on.
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.
They'd be lucky to have you.
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.
I'm a trickster.
So mischievous.
Sorry about that time I turned you
into a frog.
It was a wonderful joke.
'Twas indeed hilarious.
You are the savior of Asgard.
- Tell my story.
- I will.
Build a statue for me.
We will build a big statue for you.
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.
I will tell Father
what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
And so, Loki died of his wounds,
giving his life for ours.
He fought back those disgusting elves,
he brought peace to the realm.
Loki, my boy...
'Twas many moons ago I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.
On that day,
I did not yet see in you
Asgard's savior. No.
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle
that melted this old fool's heart.
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.
Father.
Shit.
My son, Thor, has returned!
Greetings, my boy.
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.
The people wanted to commemorate him.
Indeed they should.
I like the statue.
A lot better looking than he was
when he was alive, though.
A little less weaselly, less greasy,
maybe.
Do you know what this is?
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster
and destroy the whole planet.
Thank you, dear.
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?
Nope.
I've been having this reoccurring dream
lately.
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.
That's just a silly dream,
signs of an overactive imagination.
Possibly.
But then I decide to go out there
and investigate.
And what do I find,
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,
all while you, Odin,
the protector of those Nine Realms,
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.
Yes, it is best
to respect our neighbors' freedom.
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.
Watching theater.
Board meetings,
and security council meetings...
- You're really gonna make me do it?
- Do what?
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir
as it returns to my hand.
Not even your face.
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.
Then I'll see you on the other side,
brother.
All right, I yield.
Behold!
Thor...
- Odinson.
- No.
You had one job. Just the one.
Where's Odin?
You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Everything was fine without you.
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.
- Ask them.
- Where's Father? Did you kill him?
You had what you wanted.
You had the independence you asked for.
Okay. I know exactly where he is.
I swear I left him right here.
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?
Great planning.
How was I supposed to know?
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.
No? Then why do you dress like one?
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.
I saw you die.
I mourned you, I cried for you.
I'm honored.
Ask him.
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture
with us?
Sure.
Start figuring out where he is.
Oh, my God.
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
She didn't dump me, you know.
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.
What's this? What are you doing?
This isn't me.
Loki.
Thor Odinson.
God of Thunder.
You can put down the umbrella.
So, Earth has wizards now?
The preferred term is
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.
All right, wizard. Who are you?
Why should I care?
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.
Take a seat.
Tea?
I don't drink tea.
What do you drink?
Not tea.
So, I keep a watch list of individuals
and beings from other realms
that may be a threat to this world.
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.
He's a worthy inclusion.
Then why bring him here?
We're looking for my father.
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was,
all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?
Promptly.
Great! Then I'll help you.
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.
And you don't have a phone.
No, I don't have a phone,
but you could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.
So if you could tell me where he is,
I can take him home.
Gladly. He's in Norway.
I'm just seeing whether this incantation
requires any Asgardian modifications.
Nope.
We don't need that.
Will you stop doing that?
I need just one strand of your hair.
Let me explain something.
My hair is not to be meddled with.
We could have just walked.
He's waiting for you.
All right.
Don't forget your umbrella.
Yes.
Sorry.
There we go.
I suppose I'll need my brother back.
Yeah. Right.
I have been falling for 30 minutes!
You can handle him from here.
Yes. Of course.
Thank you very much for your help.
Good luck.
Handle me? Who are you?
Loki.
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...
Bye-bye.
Father?
Look at this place. It's beautiful.
Father, it's us.
My sons.
I've been waiting for you.
I know. We've come to take you home.
Home, yes.
Your mother, she calls me.
Do you hear it?
Loki, lift your magic.
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.
Frigga would have been proud.
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.
I know we failed you.
But we can make this right.
I failed you.
It is upon us. Ragnarok.
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.
No.
It has already begun. She's coming.
My life was all that held her back.
But my time has come.
I cannot keep her away any longer.
Father, who are you talking about?
Goddess of Death. Hela.
My firstborn.
Your sister.
Your what?
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.
Locked her away.
She draws her strength from Asgard,
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.
No, we won't.
I'm on a different path now.
This you must face alone.
I love you, my sons.
Look at that.
Remember this place.
Home.
Brother.
This was your doing.
So he's gone.
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.
You must be Hela.
I'm Thor, son of Odin.
Really? You don't look like him.
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.
You sound like him.
Kneel.
Beg your pardon?
Kneel.
Before your queen.
I don't think so.
It's not possible.
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.
Bring us back!
No!
Loki!
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?
I'm Hela.
I'm just a janitor.
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.
How would you like a job?
Are you a fighter?
Or are you food?
I'm just passing through.
It is food.
On your knees.
He's mine.
Wait!
Wait!
He's mine.
So if you want him, you go through me.
But we've already got him.
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.
More food.
Thank you.
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.
I've got something special.
Hey! Where are you taking me?
Answer me!
Hey!
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.
Many apologies, your majesty.
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard,
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.
My father is dead.
As are the princes.
You're welcome.
We were once the seat
of absolute power in the Cosmos.
Our supremacy was unchallenged.
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.
Our destiny is to rule over all others.
And I am here to restore that power.
Kneel before me
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.
Whoever you are,
whatever you've done, surrender now!
Or we will show you no mercy.
Whoever I am?
Did you listen to a word I said?
This is your last warning!
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Fine.
Charge!
I've missed this.
Still, it's a shame.
Good soldiers dying for nothing,
all because
they couldn't see the future.
Sad.
Look, still alive.
Change of heart?
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.
You evil demoness!
Let's go see my palace.
Fear not, for you are found.
You are home,
and there is no going back.
No one leaves this place.
But what is this place?
The answer is Sakaar.
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.
It is the collection point
for all lost and unloved things.
Like you.
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.
You are valuable.
Here you are loved.
What the hell?
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.
He is the original,
the first lost and the first found.
The creator of Sakaar,
and father of the Contest of Champions.
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.
You are the property of the Grandmaster.
Congratulations!
You will meet the Grandmaster
in five seconds.
Prepare yourself.
Prepare yourself.
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.
He's wonderful.
It is a he?
It is a he.
Yeah.
I love when you come to visit, 142.
You bring me the best stuff.
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
about Scrapper 142,
what do I always say? "She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."
Trash.
No, not trash.
Were you waiting just to call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."
Booze hag.
I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."
'Cause I always say you're the best.
She brought me my beloved champion,
you know.
You say that every time she's here.
What have you brought today? Tell me.
A contender.
A what?
I need to go closer.
I want to get a closer look at this.
Can you take us closer? Thank you.
Pay this lady.
Just wait a damn minute.
I'm not for sale.
Man, he's a fighter.
I take 10 million.
Tell her she's dreaming.
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.
You'll pay for this.
No, I got paid for this.
Here's what I wanna know.
Who are you?
I am the God of Thunder.
I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your
fingers, was that sparkles?
We've located your cousin.
Good!
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.
There he is.
Hey, cuz.
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?
Hi.
So...
Please.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Carlo...
I pardon you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're officially pardoned.
From life.
Help me.
Oh, my God!
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!
The smell.
What does it smell like?
Burnt toast.
What happened to my manners?
I haven't properly introduced myself.
Come on. Follow me.
My name is Grandmaster.
I preside over a little harlequinade
called the Contest of Champions.
People come from far and wide
to unwillingly participate in it.
And you, my friend,
might just be part of the new cast.
What do you say to that?
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games.
I'm going back to Asgard.
Ass-gard.
One, two, three, four.
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.
At that moment, I let go.
Loki?
Loki! Loki!
Over here. Over here.
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!
- What?
- You're alive?
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.
- Get me out of this one. Get me out.
- I can't.
- I can't.
- What?
I've made friends with this man.
He's called the Grandmaster.
- He's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.
The Bifrost brought me out here
weeks ago.
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.
I just got here.
What are you whispering about?
Time works real different
around these parts.
On any other world, I'd be, like,
millions of years old.
But here on Sakaar...
In any case, you know this...
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
God of Thunder.
Tell him.
I've never met this man in my life.
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.
Is he any kind of a fighter?
You take this thing out of my neck
and I'll show you.
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.
If you wanna get back to Ass-place,
Assberg...
Asgard.
Any contender who defeats my champion,
their freedom they shall win.
Fine. Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick!
That's what I call, contender.
Direction would be this way, Lord.
Loki!
Hey. Take it easy, man.
Over here.
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.
I'm kind of like the leader in here.
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.
But don't let that intimidate you.
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke
for you.
This is my very good friend over here,
Miek.
He's an insect and has knives for hands.
You're a Kronan, aren't you?
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.
So hardly anyone turned up, except for
my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.
As punishment, I was forced
to be in here and become a gladiator.
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.
Do you reckon you'd be interested?
How did you...
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here, man.
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?
Doug has.
Doug!
Our luck, Doug's dead.
That's right.
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.
What about you? You're made of rocks.
Perishable rock.
There you go. Another one gone.
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.
Wait. You're not gonna face him,
are you?
Yes, I am.
Gonna fight him, win,
and get the hell out of this place.
That's exactly what Doug used to say.
See you later, new Doug.
Does no one remember me?
Has no one been taught our history?
Look at these lies.
Goblets and garden parties?
Peace treaties?
Odin...
Proud to have it,
ashamed of how he got it.
We were unstoppable.
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.
One by one, the realms became ours.
But then,
simply because my ambition outgrew his,
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.
Before that,
Asgard's warriors were honored,
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.
Most of the stuff in here is fake.
Or weak.
Smaller than I thought it would be.
That's not bad.
But this...
The Eternal Flame.
Want to see what true power
really looks like?
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
I've missed you.
I've missed you all.
Odin,
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,
where the brave shall live forever.
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,
for those that have died
the glorious death.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Being lied to.
Being told you're one thing
and then learning it's all a fiction.
You didn't think
I'd really come and see you, did you?
This place is disgusting.
Does this mean you don't want my help?
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position
with the Grandmaster.
It took me time to win his trust.
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.
What I'm telling you is, you could
join me at the Grandmaster's side.
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?
Our sister destroyed your hammer
like a piece of glass.
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.
You don't stand a chance.
Do you understand
what I'm saying here?
Fine.
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.
Like I've always done.
Would you say something?
Say something!
What would you like me to say?
You faked your own death,
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.
Have I said enough or would you like me
to go back further than the past two days?
You know, I haven't seen this
beloved champion he talks of,
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.
I've placed a large wager against you
tomorrow.
Don't let me down.
Piss off, ghost!
He's freaking gone.
Yuck!
There's still someone's hair and blood
all over this.
Guys, can you clean up the weapons
once you finish your fight?
Disgusting slobs.
Thor,
wanna use a big wooden fork?
No.
Yeah, not really useful.
Unless you're fighting off three vampires
that were huddled together.
I really wish I had my hammer.
Hammer?
Quite unique.
It was made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.
And when I spun it really, really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.
You rode a hammer?
No, I didn't ride the hammer.
The hammer rode you on your back?
No. I used to spin it really fast,
and it would pull me off the...
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?
The ground. It would pull me off the
ground, up into the air, and I would fly.
Every time I threw it,
it would always come back to me.
Sounds like you had a pretty special
and intimate relationship with this hammer
and that losing it was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.
That's a nice way of putting it.
I said they're mine.
See her,
that's the one that put me in here.
Yeah. Scrapper 142.
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.
They are hard to perish.
Asgardian?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.
Asgard is in danger.
My God, you're a Valkyrie.
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger,
until I found out that
you were all women.
There's nothing wrong with women,
of course. I love women.
Sometimes a little too much.
Not in a creepy way,
just more of a respectful appreciation.
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.
It's about time.
Are you done?
Lord of Thunder, you're up.
Please, help me. I need your help.
Bye.
Fine, then you must be a traitor
or a coward.
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect
the throne.
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.
Bring him in for processing.
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.
Now, don't you move.
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair,
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.
Please.
Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.
Please! No!
No!
Look at all of you.
What a show! What a night!
Who's having fun?
Please, I'm your host.
Big round of applause
for all of our undercard competitors,
who today died so gruesomely.
Good sports.
What a show! What a night!
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.
And now, without further ado,
it's main event time.
Making his first appearance,
though he looks quite promising,
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.
I'll say no more, see what you think.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Lord of Thunder.
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.
Okay, this is it.
Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.
He is a creature.
What can we say about him?
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.
I feel a special connection with him.
He's undefeated.
He's the reigning.
He's the defending.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you...
Your Incredible...
Hulk!
Yes!
I have to get off this planet.
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
Hey!
We know each other.
He's a friend from work.
Where have you been?
Everybody thought you were dead.
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer.
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?
He's up there.
Loki! Look who it is!
Banner,
I never thought I would say this,
but I'm happy to see you.
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!
Banner.
Hey, Banner!
No Banner. Only Hulk.
What are you doing?
It's me. It's Thor!
Banner, we're friends.
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!
Here we go.
What?
Hey, big guy.
The sun's getting real low.
That's it.
The sun's going down.
I won't hurt you anymore.
No one will.
Yes!
That's how it feels!
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.
All right. Screw it.
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out!
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!
I told them we were friends!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Another day, another Doug.
What is that noise?
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.
There's a resistance trying to knock down
the front gates.
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.
What I meant was,
what's your ambition?
I just want a chance to prove myself.
Recognition.
When I was young,
every great king had an executioner.
Not just to execute people,
but also to execute their vision.
But mainly to execute people.
Still, it was a great honor.
I was Odin's executioner.
And you shall be my executioner.
Let's begin our conquest.
Skurge, where's the sword?
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.
Those people you mentioned,
the ones who aren't falling into line...
Round them up.
Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
These bloody things are everywhere.
Come on.
You'll be safe here.
Are we cool?
It's Hulk in a hot tub.
So how long
have you been like that?
Like what?
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.
Hulk always Hulk.
How'd you get here?
Winning.
You mean cheating?
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?
How'd you arrive here?
Quinjet.
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?
That's naked.
He's very naked.
It's in my brain now.
Quinjet.
Yes!
I'm getting us out of here.
This terrible, awful place.
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.
Hulk stay.
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.
We must prevent Ragnarok.
Ragnarok?
The prophesied death of my home world.
The end of days, it's the end of...
If you help me get back to Asgard,
I can help you get back to Earth.
Earth hate Hulk.
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.
You're one of the Avengers.
One of the team, one of our friends.
This is what friends do.
They support each other.
You're Banner's friend.
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.
Banner's friend.
I don't even like Banner.
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."
Thor go. Hulk stay.
Fine.
Stay here.
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.
Smash you.
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Baby arms.
- What?
Baby.
Moron! You big child.
Thor go!
I am going.
Thor go again.
Thor home.
Hulk trains.
That's great. Have fun.
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.
What have you been up to?
Winning.
Heimdall, I know you can see me.
I need you to help me.
Help me see.
I see you, but you're far away.
What's going on here?
Come see for yourself.
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold
built by our ancestors.
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?
We won't last long if we stay.
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.
Come on.
Hela is ravenous.
If I let her leave, she'll consume
Nine Realms and all the Cosmos.
We need you.
I'm working on it. But I don't even know
where the hell I am.
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.
- Which one?
- The big one.
Thor sad.
Shut up.
Thor sad.
I'm not sad, you idiot.
I'm pissed off!
Angry. I lost my father.
I lost my hammer.
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
- You're not even listening.
Don't kick stuff.
You're being a really bad friend.
You bad friend!
- You know what we call you?
- No.
We call you the stupid Avenger.
You're tiny Avenger!
What, are you crazy?
Yes.
You know what? Earth does hate you.
No.
I'm sorry I said those things.
You're not the stupid Avenger.
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.
It's okay.
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.
Hulk always, always angry.
I know.
We're the same, you and I.
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.
Yeah, same.
Hulk like fire, Thor like water.
We're kind of both like fire.
But Hulk like real fire.
Hulk like raging fire.
Thor like smoldering fire.
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.
Angry girl.
What's going on? What are you...
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone?
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.
I need her to stay.
Stay?
Block.
Stay.
- Please.
- Please.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I'll listen to you
till this is empty.
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.
We need to get back there.
I need your help.
Finished. Bye.
Odin is dead.
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.
I'm going to stop her.
- Alone?
- Nope.
I'm putting together a team.
It's me, you, and the big guy.
No. No team. Only Hulk.
It's me and you.
I think it's only you.
Please, listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.
I'm not getting dragged into
another one of Odin's family squabbles.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace
and tried to seize the throne.
When she tried
to escape her banishment
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.
I only survived because...
Look, I already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne,
and it cost me everything.
That's what's wrong with Asgard.
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.
I agree.
Don't get familiar.
I agree.
That's why I turned down the throne.
But this isn't about the crown.
This is about the people.
They're dying
and they're your people, too.
Forget it.
I have.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Good. Great.
- Great.
Thank you.
- For what?
- For this.
Didn't see that, did you?
There... That's better.
You know, go ahead.
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.
Keep drinking, keep hiding.
But me...
I choose to run toward my problems
and not away from them.
Because that's what...
Because that's what heroes do.
Friend stay!
Yes!
All right.
Come on.
Welcome. Voice activation required.
Thor.
Access denied.
Thor, son of Odin.
Access denied.
God of Thunder.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Damn you, Stark.
Point Break.
Welcome, Point Break.
Friend stay!
No, no, no!
Stop!
Stay!
Hulk, stop breaking everything!
Don't go!
Nice work, big guy.
We don't know where Ultron's headed,
but you're going very high, very fast.
So, I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode,
so I need you to help me out. Okay?
I need you to...
No! No, Banner!
Oh, jeez.
Banner.
Hey, hey, hey.
You all right, Banner?
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.
That's it, breathe.
I won't hurt you.
Sun's going down.
- Thor.
- Yeah.
What happened to your hair?
Some creepy old man cut it off.
- It looks good.
- Thanks.
Where are we? How's Nat?
- Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?
- Banner, listen.
- What?
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.
What are you saying?
What?
I've been Hulk for two years?
I'm afraid so.
What the hell happened?
Banner, there's something
you should know.
Voice activation required.
Banner.
Welcome, strongest Avenger.
What?
Ship's log.
Thor, where are we?
Yeah, about that.
Sakaar, hear ye.
Attention please. I have some bad news.
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.
Who's that?
He kind of runs the place.
You actually lived at his house
for awhile.
- I did?
- Yeah.
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.
Doesn't sound right.
Well, it's true.
It seems that that criminally seductive
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.
Oh, no.
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.
No, no, no.
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.
These are Tony's clothes.
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?
No, he's not here.
But listen. Just stay calm, okay?
The sun's going down. The sun's getting
really low. Sun's going down.
I'm upset!
I'm very upset.
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.
And you know who I'm blaming?
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!
Don't interrupt me!
Here you go.
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?
He was interrupting.
That's not a capital violation.
Where was I?
My precious champion
has come up missing,
and it's all because of that
Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.
Your brother.
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated, or you know.
I'm sure there's a big history.
And your contender...
My dear friend,
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could
bring them both back to you. Alive.
I could do it in two.
I could do it in one.
Let's stop there.
You know what? I woke up this morning
thinking about a public execution.
But for now,
I'll settle for this sweet little
"Who's gonna get him first?"
So, you're on the clock.
What have you done?
I don't answer to you, lackey.
It's Loki.
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.
Why would you help my brother escape
with that green fool?
I don't help anyone.
You're a Valkyrie.
I thought the Valkyrie had all died
gruesome deaths.
Choose your next words wisely.
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low.
Oh, shoot.
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?
I just need you to stay calm.
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.
Yeah. One.
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.
It's a new experience.
My neurons, they're firing faster
than my brain can handle the information.
The whole thing
is totally different this time.
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.
No, it's not what matters.
What I'm trying to tell you, is that
if I turn into the Hulk again,
Banner may never come back.
And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.
Thank you.
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.
What?
Listen, my people are in great danger.
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,
who also happens to be my sister.
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...
I don't wanna fight your sister.
That's a family issue.
No, she's an evil being.
I don't care what she is.
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.
- What?
- I just told you.
If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.
And you don't care.
No, no. I'm putting together the team.
The Hulk is the fire.
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.
- What? No!
- It's gross.
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.
No! I don't even like the Hulk.
He's all like...
"Smash, smash, smash."
I prefer you.
Thanks.
But if I'm being honest,
when it comes to fighting evil beings,
he is very powerful and useful.
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
Is he though?
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.
What are you doing with that?
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?
Because you were naked.
Okay, I'll give you that.
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!
Tony wears his pants super tight.
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.
Maybe the fact that I was trapped
for two years
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.
Hey. It's okay.
You're good. Calm down. Come on.
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard
and you're not gonna have to think about
the Hulk ever again. All right?
All right.
This is bad.
Banner! Banner!
Banner!
Banner!
Thor!
Hi.
Hi.
I was gonna do that.
Yeah, well, I did it first.
That's good. What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.
I got sidetracked.
What's with the...
It's my disguise.
But I can see your face.
Not when I do this, you can't.
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did
with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?
What are those things on her eyes?
Are those people that she's killed?
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.
Who is this guy?
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too.
Look, I've spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.
Sakaar seemed like the best place
to drink and forget, and to die one day.
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.
I don't plan to stop drinking.
But I don't wanna forget.
I can't turn away anymore,
so if I'm gonna die,
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.
- Good.
- Yeah.
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.
Has it got a name?
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.
Revengers?
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.
Do you want revenge?
I'm undecided.
Okay.
Also, I've got a peace offering.
Surprise.
Just had to be sure.
Hello, Bruce.
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.
Where are you at these days?
It varies from moment to moment.
Is that a Dragonfang?
It is.
My God.
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
apart as any two known systems.
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.
Nope. We are going through the big one.
The Devil's Anus?
Anus?
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
We need another ship.
That will tear mine to pieces.
She's right. We need one that can
withstand the geodetic strain
from the singularity.
And has an offline
power steering system
that could also function
without the on board computer.
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.
What do you say?
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.
Talk about an adventure.
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.
There are one or two ships.
Absolute top of the line models...
I don't mean to impose...
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.
I may even have stolen the access codes
to his security system.
And suddenly you're overcome
with an urge to do the right thing.
Heavens, no.
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster,
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.
You're telling us that you can get us
access into the garage
without setting off any alarms?
Yes, brother. I can.
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.
He did try to kill me.
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.
There was one time
when we were children,
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.
So, I went to pick up the snake
to admire it,
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.
If we're boosting a ship
we're gonna need to draw some guards
away from the palace.
Why not set the beast loose?
Shut up.
You guys have a beast?
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.
We're going to start a revolution.
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.
Is that some sort of protoplasm,
all the stuff that's coming out of you,
or are they eggs?
Looks like eggs.
I'm looking for Korg.
Who's asking?
I know you're asking.
Is there anyone else asking,
or is it just you?
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.
The revolution has begun.
Revolution? How did this happen?
Don't know.
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated
and the slaves have armed themselves.
I don't like that word.
Which? Mainframe?
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?
No, the "S" word.
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.
Okay, that's better.
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.
I disagree.
Open communication
was never our family's forte.
You have no idea.
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.
Hello.
Hi.
Odin brought us together.
It's almost poetic that his death
should split us apart.
We might as well be strangers now.
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.
Here's the thing.
I'm probably better off staying here
on Sakaar.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Did you just agree with me?
Come on, this place is perfect for you.
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...
Brother, you're gonna do great here.
Do you truly think so little of me?
Loki, I thought the world of you.
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.
I don't know,
maybe there's still good in you.
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.
Yeah.
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.
It's what you always wanted.
Hey, let's do "Get Help."
- What?
- "Get Help."
No.
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.
- It's great. It works every time.
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.
We're doing it.
We are not doing "Get Help."
Get help! Please!
My brother, he's dying.
Get help! Help him!
Classic.
Still hate it.
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?
The Commodore.
Right.
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.
Loki.
I know I've betrayed you many times
before,
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.
Never one for sentiment, were you?
Easier to let it burn.
I agree.
That looks painful.
Dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.
I trust you, you betray me.
Round and round in circles we go.
See, Loki, life is about...
It's about growth.
It's about change.
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief,
but you could be more.
I'll just put this over here for you.
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.
All right, I can figure this out.
It's just another spaceship.
Loyal Sakaarians,
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship
and my favorite champion.
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.
Do not let him leave this planet.
- Good shot!
- Thanks.
Open the doors.
Okay.
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.
Why?
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?
Yes, we should.
Where are the guns on this ship?
There aren't any.
- It's a leisure vessel.
- What?
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,
orgies and stuff.
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?
Yeah.
Don't touch anything.
No!
- No!
- No!
Get inside!
In a minute.
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!
Okay, come on.
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.
That looks like a gun.
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
Yeah!
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!
There she is.
Our ticket out of here.
Hey, what's this?
Thank you.
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.
You wanna come?
You do seem like you're
in desperate need of leadership.
Why, thank you.
Here we go.
Shit.
Asgardians...
Some misguided soul
has stolen the Bifrost sword.
Tell us where it is
or there will be consequences.
Bad ones.
Well?
You.
Well? Executioner?
Wait!
Wait!
I know where the sword is.
I never thought I'd be back here.
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.
I mean, not that it's not nice.
It's just, it's on fire.
Here, up here in the mountains.
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.
She's coming for them.
Okay, drop me off at the palace
and I'll draw her away.
And get yourself killed?
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you
two to help get everyone off Asgard.
How the hell are we supposed to do that?
I have a man on the ground.
Asgard.
She's here.
Now the ship has a gun.
I'll take it from here.
I found this in the armory.
Good luck.
Your Majesty...
Don't die.
You know what I mean.
We must keep moving!
Go to the Bifrost!
Sister.
You're still alive.
I love what you've done with the place.
Redecorating, I see.
It seems our father's solution
to every problem was to cover it up.
Or to cast it out.
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.
You see?
You never knew him.
Not at his best.
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations
in blood and tears.
Where do you think all this gold
came from?
And then, one day,
he decided to become a benevolent king.
To foster peace, to protect life.
To have you.
I understand why you're angry.
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.
But it can't be you.
You're just the worst.
Okay, get up.
You're in my seat.
You know, Father once told me
that a wise king never seeks out war.
But must always be ready for it.
Go back!
Go!
To be honest, I expected more.
Heimdall!
The sword!
Here's the difference between us.
I'm Odin's firstborn,
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.
And you're nothing.
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.
Now you remind me of Dad.
The stupid dog won't die!
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.
You wanted to know who I am?
What the hell are you talking about?
You'll see!
You see? No one's going anywhere.
I'll get that sword,
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.
Hey, man.
I'm Korg. This is Miek.
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?
Your savior is here.
Did you miss me?
Everyone, on that ship now.
Welcome home. I saw you coming.
Of course you did.
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.
You see...
I'm not a queen or a monster.
I'm the Goddess of Death.
What were you the god of, again?
Even when you had two eyes,
you'd see only half the picture.
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.
It was never your source of strength.
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.
Asgard is not a place. Never was.
This could be Asgard.
Asgard is where our people stand.
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.
I'm not as strong as you.
No...
You're stronger.
Tell me, brother.
What were you the god of, again?
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.
This isn't over.
I think we should disband the Revengers.
Hit her with a lightning blast.
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.
It did nothing.
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.
It won't end there.
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.
She'll hunt us down.
We need to stop her here and now.
So what do we do?
I'm not doing "Get Help."
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.
Loki,
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.
This was about causing Ragnarok.
Surtur's crown, the vault.
It's the only way.
Bold move, brother.
Even for me.
Shall we?
After you.
This is madness.
Go! Go, now!
For Asgard.
Hela!
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
Hela, enough!
You want Asgard, it's yours.
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.
You can't defeat me.
No, I know.
But he can.
No.
Tremble before me, Asgard!
I am your reckoning!
The people are safe.
That's all that matters.
We're fulfilling the prophecy.
I hate this prophecy.
So do I, but we have no choice.
Surtur destroys Asgard,
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.
But we need to let him finish the job,
otherwise...
No!
Hulk, stop, you moron!
Hulk, stop.
Just for once in your life, don't smash.
Big monster!
Let's go!
Fine.
I am Asgard's doom!
The damage is not too bad.
As long as the foundations
are still strong,
we can rebuild this place.
It will become a haven
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.
What have I done?
You saved us from extinction.
Asgard is not a place...
It's a people.
It suits you.
Maybe you're not so bad after all,
brother.
Maybe not.
Thank you.
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.
I'm here.
Your throne.
So, King of Asgard.
Where to?
I'm not sure.
Any suggestions?
Miek, where are you from?
Miek's dead.
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him
on the bridge.
I've just felt so guilty,
I've been carrying him around all day.
Miek, you're alive!
He's alive, guys.
What was your question again, bro?
Earth it is.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to go back to Earth?
Yes, of course. The people of Earth
love me. I'm very popular.
Let me rephrase that.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to bring me back to Earth?
Probably not, to be honest.
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like
everything's gonna work out fine.
Oh, boy.
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.
Come on. No?
Me too.
'Cause I've been a big part of it.
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.
So, you're welcome.
And it's a tie.

Things are never gonna be
the same now.
I mean, look at this.
You got aliens.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.
Yeah. Tell you what, though.
It ain't bad, is it?
No. Yeah.
Kid's got a future.
Yeah, well...
...we'll see, I guess.
No, hey!
You can't saw through that stuff.
These alien bastards are tough.
You gotta use the stuff they use.
- See? All right.
- All right.
Oh, hey!
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.
Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.
This is a huge deal for us.
Attention, please!
In accordance
with Executive Order 396B...
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
Qualified personnel.
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so-
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under ou rjurisdiction.
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected...
...or you will be prosecuted.
Ma'am, what am-- ?
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.
Look...
...I bought trucks for this job.
I brought in a whole new crew.
These guys have a family.
I have a family.
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.
What'd you say?
Yeah.
He's right. I overextended myself.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.
Put them down.
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?
A joint venture between Stark Industries
and the government...
...the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection...
...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.
Yeah, it's all rigged.
Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material...
...scattered throughout the tri-state area.
Hey, chief!
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?
I ain't hauling it.
It's too bad.
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.
I tell you what.
Let's keep it.
The world's changing.
It's time we change, too.
There you go, Mason.
Business is good.
New York. Queens.
- t's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.
- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.
Then why are you narrating
in that voice?
- Because it's fun.
- Fun.
So why do they call you Happy?
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.
Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?
There's a bathroom on it.
No pilot? That's awesome.
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.
This is your first time
on a private plane?
My first time on any plane.
Should it-- ? Should it be-- ?
Should it be making that noise?
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.
Something about
Captain America going crazy.
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?
We're not roommates. Suit up.
Okay, Peter, you got this.
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.
- Where's the case?
- What case?
What? I thought that was a closet.
- This is still my room?
- Go.
- My room is way bigger than--
- There.
I found the case. I found the case.
"A minor upgrade"?
Oh, my God.
- Put it on.
- What the-- ?
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen--
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.
This is insane. Insane.
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.
Hey, everyone.
The craziest thing just happened.
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him--
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"
And then-- Hey, just a second!
coming!
L- ley-
We have thin walls here.
What are you doing, a little video diary?
- Yeah.
- It's all right.
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.
Hey. You know what?
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.
Three, two, one. Hey, May.
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...
...this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.
Everyone was impressed.
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.
That was a private conversation.
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.
- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line.
- Can you give us a moment?
- Want me to leave?
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.
I can keep the suit?
Yes, we were just talking about it.
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.
I've seen his cardiogram.
- All right?
- Yes.
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.
- This it?
- Seventh floor.
- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?
- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.
So when's our next-- ?
When's our next "retreat," you know?
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?
No, I mean, we'll call you.
Like, someone will call you. All right?
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.
Bye.
They're gonna call me.
What's up, Penis Parker?
Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.
Don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.
Do you have a date for homecoming?
Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Damn it. You, in my office right now.
Join me, and together...
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.
- What?
- So lame.
That's awesome. How many pieces?
Three thousand eight hundred and three.
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark--
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.
Always got that internship.
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.
Here's a gold coin."
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.
That'd be great.
I'm gonna be late.
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...
...between points A and B?
Flash.
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.
Nope. Peter. You still with us?
Yeah, yeah.
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.
You're dead.
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...
...but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing...
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.
Did Liz get a new top?
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.
Too late.
You guys are losers.
Well, then why do you sit with us?
Because I don't have any friends.
Next question.
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?
Hydrogen's the lightest.
That's not the question. Okay.
- Yeah.
- Uranium.
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.
Peter, it's nationals.
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.
Wait. What's happening?
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.
- No, no, no.
- Why not?
Really? Right before nationals?
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.
Flash, you're in for Peter.
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.
I got a hot date
with Black Widow coming up.
That is false.
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Delmar?
Hey, Mr. Parker.
Number five, right?
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.
You got it, boss.
How's your aunt?
Yeah, she's all right.
She's a very hot Italian woman.
How's your daughter?
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.
Here's 5 dollars.
What's up, Murph?
How you doing, buddy?
So how's school?
It's boring. Got better things to do.
Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.
Finally.
- What's the matter with you?
- Could you hold this?
Thanks.
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?
Everybody good?
Hey!
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?
Call me Spider-Man.
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.
- Yeah!
- Not bad.
Hey, buddy.
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumb-ass!
Hey! Shut that off!
- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was--
- I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!
- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know?
- He was putting that in the window!
- Every day with these alarms!
- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there, punk.
Hey, Gary. How you doing?
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?
I'm good, I'm good.
You have reached
the voice-mail box of:
Happy Hogan.
Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.
I just feel like I could be doing more.
You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.
So, yeah, just call me back.
It's Peter. Parker.
Why would I tell him about the churro?
Hey, hey-
Okay.
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.
Oh, nice.
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?
You're the Avengers.
What are you guys doing here?
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.
Hey"
Oh, this feels so weird.
What is that thing?
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.
911. What's your emergency?
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.
Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?
No. Wait, wait, wait!
Mr. Delmar.
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
ls anybody in here? Hello?
Oh, come on.
I gotta--
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.
Okay. Good. Yes.
Yes-- No. No, put that down.
That's worth more
than you or me. Yeah?
The craziest thing just happened.
These guys were robbing an ATM...
- ...with high-tech weapons--
- Take a breath. I don't have time...
- ...for ATM robberies...
- Yeah, but--
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.
Everything's gotta be out next week.
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?
Tony sold Avengers Tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate...
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?
What about you?
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?
- Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?
- Stay away from anything dangerous.
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?
I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap.
- My backpack's gone.
- That doesn't sound responsible.
- I'll call you back.
- Feel free not to.
What was that?
It's nothing. Nothing.
You're the Spider-Man.
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.
You can't just bust into my room!
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.
A thing to do after.
Okay.
Maybe put on some clothes.
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.
Mr. Stark knows
because he made my suit. That's it.
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?
Yeah, basically.
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.
Come on, Ned, please.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I-- Please.
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?
I swear.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
I can't believe this is happening now.
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.
Okay, well, wait, then.
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?
This is the Stark internship.
Just get out of here.
What's the matter?
Thought you loved larb.
It's too larby?
Not larby enough.
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?
You know I larb you.
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.
A lot of work.
The Stark internship.
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.
- Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...
- What does he have you doing?
- ...in an explosion...
- You need to use your instincts.
...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...
What?
...the Spider-Man.
As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...
...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.
Miraculously, no one was harmed.
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Six blocks away from us.
I need a new backpack.
- What?
- I need a new backpack.
That's five.
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.
It's on the house.
Thanks.
That's nice of him.
I think he larbs you.
You got bit by a spider?
Can it bite me?
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.
Maybe. How much did it hurt?
The spider's dead, Ned.
You were here?
Yeah.
You could've died.
Do you lay eggs?
What? No.
- Can you spit venom?
- No.
Can you summon an army of spiders?
No, Ned.
The Sokovia Accords were put
into place...
How far can you shoot your webs?
It's unknown. Shut up.
-- To begin regulating...
If I was you,
I would stand on a building...
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could--
- Shut up, Ned.
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.
...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.
- I stole his shield.
- What?
Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher...
...will conduct
the Captain America Fitness Challenge.
Thank you, Captain.
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.
It's required by the state. Let's do it.
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?
What does Hulk smell like?
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?
Ned, just...okay?
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset...
...telling the other guy where t0 go?
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- I don't need a guy in the chair.
Looking good, Parker.
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.
Well, what about the Spider-Man?
It's just Spider-Man.
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.
Oh, my God,
she's crushing on Spider-Man.
No way.
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.
Like, what if he's seriously burned?
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.
Peter knows Spider-Man.
No, I don't. No. I-- I mean--
They're friends.
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.
But it's...
...through the Stark internship.
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.
It's okay.
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?
What are you doing?
Helping you out.
Did you not hear her?
Liz has a crush on you.
Dude, you're an Avenger.
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.
House party in the suburbs.
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.
It'll be a night to remember.
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.
Yeah, it gives me confidence.
This is a mistake.
Hey, let's just go home.
Oh, Peter.
I know. I know it's really hard...
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.
It's flowering now.
He's so stressed out lately.
What helps with stress is a party.
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.
Peter.
- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.
Bye, May.
Dude, you have the suit, right?
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.
L- ley-
DJ Flash.
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in...
...say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.
Can't believe you're at this lame party.
But you're here too.
Am w.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.
I'm so happy you guys came.
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
- What a great party.
- Thanks.
Oh, I--
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta--
- Yeah.
- Have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Dude, what are you doing?
She's here. Spider it up.
No, no, no. I can't-- I cannot do this.
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.
Peter, no one wants that.
Dude.
Penis Parker, what's up?
So where's your pal Spider-Man?
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?
He must be around..."
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?
What the hell?
This sucks.
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.
Here. You try.
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.
I got antigrav climbers.
Yo, climbers?
Okay, what the hell is that?
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.
All right.
What was that?
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.
Did you just do it again?
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.
Toomes's phone.
Boss.
Oh, my butt!
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.
Hey, hey, buddy.
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.
Now, this is more like it.
Smells really good.
Great movie!
Oh, hey, guys.
NO! No!
Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.
Peter, where are you?
The hat's not working. This is not cool.
Almost got you.
Thought you got away from me,
didn't you?
I got you right where I want you.
Surprise!
What the hell?
Oh, hey.
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?
I put everything in your suit.
Including this heater.
That's better. Thanks.
What were you thinking?
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.
Take him down now, huh?
Crockett, there are people
who handle this son of thing.
- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.
Mr. Stark, you didn't have
to come out here.
I had that. I was fine.
Oh, I'm not here.
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...
...or you would be toast right now.
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.
Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.
- Why?
- Why?
Because I said so!
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.
Stay close to the ground.
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.
Can't you just be a friendly...
...neighborhood Spider-Man?
But I'm ready for more than that now.
No, you're not.
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.
Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.
Are you driving?
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.
I got some pull at MIT. End call.
No, I don't need to go to--
Mr. Stark is no longer connected.
That's awesome.
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."
- Penis!
- Parker!
- Penis!
- Parker!
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
Idiots.
Idiots.
Idiots!
Boss?
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?
Sorry. You left it out.
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?
You're still on that? I told you, no.
The answer's no. Forget it.
I mean, that was badass.
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.
Under the radar!
That's how we survive.
If you bring Damage Control
or the Avengers down here, we're through.
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars...
...calling yourself the Shocker.
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?
Whatever, old man. Come on.
Look.
Look.
I know you don't give a crap
about anything.
But I do.
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I can't afford your bullshit.
- Get out of here.
- What?
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.
All right.
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?
With everything I know.
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying...
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.
- You know what?
- What?
You're right.
- That work?
- I don't know.
I can't afford that.
Wait.
Damn.
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?
No, that's that one.
Here.
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.
All right.
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.
Yeah, well, something came up.
What is that?
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Awesome.
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.
So scary.
Well, look, I think it's...
...a power source.
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.
That's an inductive charging plate. That's
what I use to charge my toothbrush.
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey...
...into this amazing--
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.
We'll go to the lab after class
and run tests.
Let's do it.
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.
We gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy."
You're right.
Crap.
Come on, come on, come on.
High schools creep me out.
They got this funny smell, you know?
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.
What?
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.
- Peter--
- No. Stay there, Ned.
Peter.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Yeah. You good?
Chess.
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.
There's no sign of the weapon.
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.
This is so awesome.
I know, right?
They're in Brooklyn.
Staten Island.
Leaving Jersey.
They stopped.
Maryland?
- What's there?
- I don't know.
Evil lair?
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.
Badass.
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?
It's not too far from D.C.
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.
No, no way. You can't quit on us...
...stroll up and be welcomed back
by everyone.
Hey, welcome back!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.
- What?
- He's taking your place.
Excuse me, can we go already?
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.
Focus up.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.
The second law of thermodynamics.
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.
Liz, don't overwork them.
Strontium, barium, vibranium.
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.
Glad to be back.
- What is the current standard unit of-- ?
- Can I take this real quick?
Yeah, fine.
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker.
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...
...is a complete violation of privacy.
- That's different.
- What's different?
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.
- It's no big deal.
- Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.
You kidding me? This place is huge.
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?
Peter...
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?
I gotta follow these guys to their boss
before they move again...
...and I don't really want Mr. Stark
to know about it.
So you're lying to Iron Man now?
No, I'm not lying.
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.
Gotcha.
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here...
...but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.
What?
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.
- t's not cool.
- But you are a kid.
A kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.
I mean, what if this is illegal?
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.
I can handle it. Ned, come on.
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.
- Don't do that.
- Come on.
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.
- They're moving.
- Be careful.
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.
We're gonna go swimming.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.
L- ley-
I was-- I was gonna go study
in the business center.
You don't need to.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.
And besides...
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so--
I-- I heard it in a TED Talk.
And I read a coaching book.
You really--
This is really important to you.
Yeah. It's our future.
I'm not gonna screw it up.
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
Let's go.
- Good evening, Peter.
- Hello? Hello?
Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...
...and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.
Thank you.
Where would you like
to take me tonight?
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.
Tracker located.
Plotting course to intercept target.
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.
One hundred meters
from destination and closing.
Jump now.
Detecting three individuals.
Why is their secret lair
in a gas station? That's so lame.
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?
Do you want to hear
what they're saying?
I can hear what they're saying? Yeah.
Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design.
Whoa, that's so cool.
Can't believe they're still cleaning up
that Triskelion mess.
I love it. They keep making messes...
- ...we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.
They're in the middle of a heist.
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.
Okay, I'll get closer
to see what's happening.
Would you like me
to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?
"Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.
Activating instant Kill.
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.
Deactivating Instant Kill.
Did you hear that?
What the hell just happened?
What was that?
You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.
What's wrong with my web-shooters?
Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
- Would you like to see more options?
You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.
Mr. Stark really overdid it.
You two wait right here.
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?
- That one.
- Great choice.
Would you like me to set this
as your new default?
No, no, no.
- Push that in. No, the other--
- Here? This one here?
- What was that?
- Taser webs.
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.
You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.
Would you like to run
a refresher course?
- No. Just-- You choose.
- Sure thing.
Six-alpha-niner,
are you running on time?
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.
Oh, that's him.
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.
Pulling in behind the caboose.
Deploy anchors.
Dropping down.
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.
All right, coming up.
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.
Oh, God.
- Suit lady, what was that?!
- You told me to choose.
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.
Activating all systems.
My head.
You appear to have a mild concussion.
Hey, so where am I right now?
I'm not sure.
The container walls are hindering
my sensors.
Wait a minute.
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have
to fight our way out of this one.
Three, two, one.
What is this place?
Suit lady, where am I?
You're in the most secure facility
on the eastern seaboard.
The Damage Control deep storage vault.
No. Seriously?
The door will most likely remain closed
until morning.
Morning?
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?
I think I should probably give you a name.
Like Liz. No, no, no.
God, that's-- That's weird.
What about Karen?
You can call me Karen
if you would like.
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?
What?
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.
- Ricochet web.
- Ricochet web.
- Cool.
- Splitter web.
- Web grenade.
- Web grenade!
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?
Who is Liz?
Who's Liz? She's--
She's the best. She's awesome.
She's just a girl who goes to my school.
And--
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."
What's weird about that?
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.
Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.
Thanks, Karen.
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.
Hey, how long we been here anyways?
- Thirty-seven minutes-
- What?!
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.
I cannot take this anymore.
I got t0-- I gotta get out of here.
There's got t0 be something in here
I can use.
Okay, let's see.
Nope.
That's awesome.
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.
That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?
t would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.
No, no, no.
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.
Trial unsuccessful.
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.
Okay. Hold on, hold on.
Initiating trial 247.
It worked. It works.
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.
Thank you.
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.
Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.
- It's Ned. Leave a message.
- Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!
There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.
We have now entered sudden death.
The next correct answer wins
the championship.
Midtown Tech?
Zero.
That is correct.
Midtown takes the championship.
- We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just--
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by--
Okay.
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?
- t's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.
- Listen.
- We're at the Washington Monument.
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.
- Is that Liz?
- Put Ned back on the phone.
- You should tell her how you feel.
- You flake. You are lucky we won.
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.
- All items on the belt, please.
- There's something in Ned's backpack.
It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through x-ray.
Liz? Liz! Damn it.
Can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?
The Chitauri core has detonated...
...and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.
Just stay calm, everyone.
Oh, we are all going to die here.
Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.
We're freaking screwed.
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.
The safety systems
are completely failing.
We're very safe in here.
The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.
Going as fast as I can!
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.
You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.
What?! Why?
Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.
- How do I get in there?
- Activating reconnaissance drone.
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.
Locating optimal entry point.
Proceed to southwest window.
Karen, I'm on my way.
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Okay. Oh, my God.
Okay.
What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.
- Why are you hesitating?
- It's fine.
I've just never been this high before.
You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...
...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.
Perfect.
Oh, my God.
Why is it not breaking?
It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.
My friends are in there! Stop!
Return to the ground immediately.
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.
Stand down!
Return to the ground immediately.
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!
Go up, 90 UP-
I got this.
Take my trophy.
This is your last chance.
I'm gonna die.
Break!
I did it.
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Let's go, let's go!
Okay, Okay-
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.
- This is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.
Liz!
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay.
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.
- Come on in.
- You guys good?
So is everyone okay?
This is your chance, Peter.
Kiss her.
Thank you.
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck...
Yeah, damn it.
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?
Yeah, but then that's it.
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.
No.
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those...
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.
Really?
I'm gonna kill him.
- I'm gonna find him--
- Found him.
The Spider-Man swooped in...
...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.
The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.
Peter. Come here,
come here, come here.
This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...
...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.
Later that day,
they also defeated death.
Explosion. Salty scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.
There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.
As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.
I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.
Not again.
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.
How can you show your spider spirit?
Dude, dude, dude.
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.
Dude, listen, I figured it out.
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.
Ned, I'm probably never gonna
come back here.
Mr. Stark is moving
the Avengers upstate...
- ...so when I bring this guy in--
- Dude.
You want to be a high school dropout?
I am so far beyond high school right now.
Parker, my office.
So...
...you got detention.
You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.
The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?
Maybe you were trying to be cool.
But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...
...the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.
We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.
Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...
- ...you know is wrong...
- Where you going? Get back here.
...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.
It's you.
So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.
May?
Hey, Karen. What's up?
Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?
I was wondering if you could help me.
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.
I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.
- Footage?
- Yes, Peter.
I record everything you see.
- Everything?
- Everything.
- All the time?
- It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.
Yeah, of course it is.
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
- With pleasure.
Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.
Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.
Go later in the day, later in the day.
It is I, Thor, son of Odin.
No, no, no. That's definitely--
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.
- Your impressions are very funny.
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.
Okay.
- The two on the right, who are they?
- Searching law enforcement databases.
No records found
for two of the individuals.
Nothing'?
- One individual identified.
Aaron Davis, age 33.
He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.
Let's pay him a visit.
Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?
Yeah.
- Remember me?
- Hey--
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.
- All right, chill.
- Come on!
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man.
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl--
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?
I need to know. Give me names or else.
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.
Look, man.
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.
They can't be out on the streets.
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half--
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- It's too much bread.
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.
The other night, you told that dude,
"if you shoot somebody, shoot me."
That's pretty ballsy.
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.
I got a nephew who live here.
Who are these guys?
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.
I don't know who he is
or where he is.
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with...
...he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.
Yes! Yes.
- Thank--
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just--
Yeah.
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?
You got to get better
at this part of the job.
I don't understand.
I'm intimidating.
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.
No, no, no. Come fix this.
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.
Nice.
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
Sure thing.
He's up front, main deck.
I hate this guy.
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?
Just keep me posted.
There's no record of him
in my criminal database.
Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.
- Who's the guy on the left?
- Mac Gargan.
Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.
Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.
White pickup truck.
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.
Oh, this is too perfect.
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.
- Incoming call from Tony Stark.
- No, no, no.
Don't answer.
- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
- I'm actually at school.
- No, you're not.
- Nice work in D. C.
- Okay.
My dad never really gave me
a lot of support...
...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.
I'm in the middle of something.
Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.
Anyway, great things are about to-
What is that?
I'm at band practice.
That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?
- I gotta go. End call.
- Hey.
I'll take those!
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry
was at 10:30. You missed it.
Spider guy's here.
Not so fast.
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.
I got to say, the other guy was way better
with that thing.
I'm honestly--
I'm-- I'm shocked.
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.
What do you mean, FBI?
- The Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- I know, but what are they doing here?
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!
No.
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.
We're getting out of here.
Activate Taser web!
You're messing with things
you don't understand.
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.
Web grenade. Web grenade.
Splitter web, go.
Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!
No, no, no.
What the hell?
What the hell?
Hi, Spider-Man.
Band practice, was it?
Yeah, Iron Man!
Mr. Stark.
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?
I think you've done enough.
So that's it. You're just gonna run?
Feds were waiting for us.
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?
Yeah, I'm running.
You should too.
You know I can't do that.
So now what?
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?
Seriously?
Yes. You will not regret this.
You in?
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch...
.../ tell you to stay away from this.
Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...
...so you could sneak around
behind my back...
...doing the one thing
I told you not to do.
ls everyone okay?
No thanks to you.
No thanks to me?
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...
...but you didn't listen.
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.
And if you died...
...I feel like that's on me.
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.
I just wanted to be like you.
And I wanted you to be better.
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.
- For how long?
- Forever.
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.
- Let's have it.
- Please, this is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Okay?
God, I sound like my dad.
I don't have any other clothes.
Okay, we'll sort that out.
L- ley-
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.
You can't do that.
Then this ferry thing happens.
I've called five police stations.
Five.
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.
Cut the bullshit.
I know you left detention.
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.
That's not fine.
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.
It's just me and you.
I lost the Stark internship.
- What?
- Yeah.
What happened?
I just thought that I could work really hard
and he could-- He would-- You know.
But I screwed it up.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I made you worry.
I'm not trying to ruin your life.
Yeah, I know.
Just--
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.
And take a shower. You smell.
You smell like garbage.
I know.
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?
Okay.
All right, get out of here.
Are you expelled?
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.
You're so lucky.
L- ley-
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.
Hey, look, I--
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.
It's fine.
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.
No, I'm--
I just mean that...
...it was not cool, especially...
...because...
...I like you.
I know.
You do?
You're terrible at keeping secrets.
Yeah, you'd be surprised.
I got to get to class, but--
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...
...forever, but--
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so--
Do you want to...
...go with me?
Yeah. Sure.
Really? I mean, great. Cool.
Cool.
I'm actually going that way.
May, I need your help.
Through or around?
Right?
It's game day. So, what's the plan?
Open the door for her.
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.
- Don't be creepy.
- No.
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.
I got this.
- Love you.
- Bye.
You must be Peter.
Yeah.
I'm Liz's dad.
Put her there.
Hell of a grip.
Come on in here. Come on.
Hi, Peter.
You look very handsome.
Thank you.
You got his name right?
- Freddie?
- Peter.
Peter. Peter.
I'm gonna go get Liz.
Okay.
You all right, Pete?
Yeah.
Because you look pale.
You want something to drink?
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?
I'm not old enough to drink.
That's the right answer.
- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.
Doesn't she, Pete?
Yeah, you look really good.
Once again, that's the right answer.
Is that a corsage?
Thanks.
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.
Okay. Come on, you guys.
Peter, closer.
Smile.
There you go.
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.
I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.
- Thank you.
- Promise.
He's cute.
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.
Come on, Pedro.
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.
Just saying, you know.
All you guys who go to that school...
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.
Really? Stark?
So cool.
What do you do?
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got...
...boring.
It was boring?
You got to hang outwith Spider-Man.
Really? Spider-Man?
What's he like?
Yeah, he's nice.
Nice man.
Solid dude.
Look. So cute.
I've seen you around, right? I mean...
...somewhere. We've-- Have we ever-- ?
Because even the voice--
He does Academic Decathlon with me.
And he was at my party.
It was a great party, really great, yeah.
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.
That was-- I was there longer
than two seconds.
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.
Were you scared?
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...
...showed up in the elevator though, huh?
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.
I saw it all from the ground.
Yeah.
Very lucky that he was there that day.
Good old Spider-Man.
Dad, the light.
Here we are. End of the line.
Thanks, Dad.
You head in there, gumdrop.
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.
Don't let him intimidate you.
Love you.
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.
Hi.
You guys look so pretty.
Does she know?
Know what?
So she doesn't. Good.
Close t0 the vest.
I admire that.
I've got a few secrets of my own.
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...
Peter...
...nothing is more important than family.
You saved my daughter's life.
I could never forget something like that.
So I'm gonna give you one chance.
Are you ready?
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...
...and don't you ever, ever...
...interfere with my business again.
Because if you do...
...I'll kill you...
...and everybody you love.
I'll kill you dead.
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?
L- ley-
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?
Just not too good.
L- ley-
What did he say to you?
Gotta go.
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this.
He gave you a choice.
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?
What's with the crappy costume?
My web-shooters.
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but damn.
Gross.
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.
Nice shot!
Yes!
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.
Get a computer and track my phone.
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...
...before he leaves town.
I'm sorry about dinner...
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So--
Flash, I need your car and phone.
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't--
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?
- Go for Ned.
- Ned, I need you...
- ...to track my phone.
- Yeah, but where is it?
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. it's--
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move!
Are you okay'?
- I've never driven before...
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.
Hey, have you gotten through
to Happy yet?
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
Guy in the chair.
Takeoff in nine minutes.
Hello? Hello? Who Is this?
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
- Who?
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you--
You gotta be shitting me.
Damn.
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.
Left, okay.
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.
It sounded like he was catching a flight.
He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.
- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.
Boxes? It's moving day.
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.
I gotta stop him!
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster Armor...
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging--
The Meg-- The--
Thor's magic belt.
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.
- What?
- Turn right.
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.
I'm...
...looking...
...at porn.
Hey!
Surprised?
Oh, hey, Pete.
I didn't hear you come in.
It's over. I've got you.
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...
...I really, really admire your grit.
I see why Liz likes you.
I do. When you first came to the house...
...I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.
How could you do this to her?
To her?
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.
I'm doing this for her.
Yeah.
Peter...
...you're young.
You don't understand
how the world works.
But I understand that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.
How do you think
your buddy Stark paid for that tower?
Or any of his little toys?
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.
Guys like us...
...like you and me...
...they don't care about us.
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.
That's how it is.
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to understand.
And...
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.
I'm sorry, Peter.
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.
True. Then again...
...wasn't really trying to.
Chief, they're powering up engines.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, ready?
Hello?
Hello!
Please, hey.
Hey, please. I'm down here.
I'm down here. I'm stuck.
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't--
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Come on, Peter.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man!
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.
Oh, yeah.
Retroreflective panels engaged.
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.
It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.
Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.
This better work, Mason.
Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life.
Yeah.
You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...
...and override their security.
Cloning transponder signal.
Launching decoy drone.
Entering new coordinates.
Good, so it's on its way.
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.
All right.
Hot dog.
Just a typical homecoming...
...on the outside of an invisible jet...
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.
Oh, God!
I can't believe that worked.
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.
I'm not going home empty-handed.
Oh, my God.
- Get out of there. What are you doing?
- Please turn, please turn!
Hey, Pedro.
Bingo.
Your wingsuit.
Your wingsuit's going to explode!
Time to go home, Pete.
I'm trying to save you!
No.
No.
It looked so insane. That whole--
Like, it was just crazy.
He-- He was just, like...
And you were like...
And then I just hit him with the...
It was so-- Oh, my God.
I mean, you saved me.
It was awesome.
Hey, Liz.
I'm gonna miss you.
Bye.
Liz.
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?
The dance?
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.
Well, yeah, but I--
I mean, your dad-- I can't imagine
what you're going through.
If there's anything I can do to help...
I guess we're moving to Oregon.
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So...
Liz, I-- I--
Bye, Peter.
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.
Yeah!
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...
...but just for motivation right now
at this practice.
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...
...a new team captain next year.
So I am appointing Michelle.
Yeah!
Thank you.
My-- My friends call me MJ.
I thought you didn't have any friends.
I didn't.
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?
What are you hiding, Peter?
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.
Hey, Happy. What-- ?
What are you doing here?
I really owe you one.
I don't know what I would do
without this job.
I mean, before I met Tony--
So how long you been here?
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.
Upstate-- Like, upstate-upstate?
Yeah, let's go.
Take a look.
It's pretty impressive, huh?
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.
How was the ride up?
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
I gotta talk to the kid.
I'll be close behind.
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.
Sorry I took your suit.
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...
...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.
- Mr. Stark, I really--
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.
But then you did the right thing.
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...
All right, not my best analogy.
I was wrong about you.
I think, with a little more mentoring...
...you could be a real asset to the team.
- To the-- ? To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.
When you're ready...
...why don't you try that on?
And I'll introduce the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:
Spider-Man.
'Can-
Yeah, give that a look.
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...
...your new quarters.
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.
Or walls.
You'll fit right in.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
But I'm good.
You're good? Good-- ?
How are you good?
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?
You're turning me down?
You better think about this.
Look at that.
Look at me.
Last chance. Yes or no?
- No.
- Okay.
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.
Happy will take you home.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.
- See you around.
- Okay.
That was a test, right?
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
Yeah, thank you.
Told you he's a good kid.
- Where's the kid?
- He left.
- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?
Think of something. How about...?
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I-- ? I-- ?
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?
I've been carrying this since 2008.
Okay.
I think I can think
of something better than that.
Well, it would buy us a little time.
Like we need time.
I can't believe you have that
in your pocket.
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?
May?
What 'the-l?!
Look who it is.
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?
Relax.
This? It's not on you.
It's on our little spider friend.
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.
And I heard a rumor.
You know who he is.
If I knew who he was...
...he'd already be dead.
Toomes, your family's here!
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.
Patience.
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.
Sometimes it leads to very little...
...and it seems like it's not worth it.
And you wonder...
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.
How many more of these?

This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel Statesman.
We are under assault.
I repeat,
we are under assault.
The engines are dead,
life support failing.
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.
We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.
Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.
We have
very few soldiers here.
This is not a warcraft.
I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.
Hear me and rejoice.
You have had the privilege
of being saved
by the Great Titan.
You may think
this is suffering.
No.
It is salvation.
Universal scales
tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.
Smile.
For even in death,
you have become
Children of Thanos.
I know what it's like to lose.
To feel so desperately
that you're right...
yet to fail, nonetheless.
It's frightening.
Turns the legs to jelly.
But I ask you, to what end?
Dread it, run from it...
destiny arrives all the same.
And now, it's here.
Or should I say...
I am.
You talk too much.
The Tesseract.
Or your brother's head.
I assume you have
a preference.
Oh, I do.
Kill away.
All right, stop!
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.
You really are
the worst brother.
I assure you, brother...
the sun will shine
on us again.
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.
And for another...
we have a Hulk.
Let him have his fun.
Allfathers...
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...
time.
That was a mistake.
No!
You're going to die for that.
Shh.
My humble personage...
bows before your grandeur.
No other being
has ever had the might...
nay, the nobility...
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.
The universe lies
within your grasp.
There are two more stones
on Earth.
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.
Father,
we will not fail you.
If I might interject.
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.
If you consider
failure experience.
I consider
experience experience.
Almighty Thanos...
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...
Odinson...
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...
god of mischief...
do hereby pledge to you...
my undying fidelity.
Undying?
You should choose your words
more carefully.
You...
will never be...
a god.
No!
No resurrections this time.
No. Loki.
Seriously,
you don't have any money?
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.
Dollars?
- Rupees.
- Which is?
Uh, buck and a half.
What do you want?
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.
Thanos is coming.
He's coming.
Who?
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.
You're totally rambling.
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,
and in the dream
you gotta pee.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."
And then you wake up
and in real life
you actually have to pee.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.
It was so real.
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.
Uh, what was his name?
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.
...and thought that we were...
- Expecting.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- No.
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.
If you wanted to have a kid...
you wouldn't have done that.
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.
You're not helping
your case, okay?
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...
You don't need that.
I know, I had the surgery.
I'm just
trying to protect us...
and future usses
and that's it.
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.
You know me so well.
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.
You should have shirts
in your closet.
Yeah.
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.
Show off this Harry Winston.
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.
I should promise you.
- Yes.
- I will.
Thank you.
Tony Stark.
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?
We need your help.
It's not overselling it
to say that
the fate of the universe
is at stake.
And who's "we"?
Hey, Tony.
Bruce.
- Pepper.
- Hi.
- Oh.
- You okay?
At the dawn
of the universe,
there was nothing. Then...
Boom.
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...
hurtling across
the virgin universe.
These Infinity Stones
each control an essential
aspect of existence.
Space.
Reality.
Power.
Soul.
Mind.
And Time.
Tell me his name again.
Thanos.
He's a plague, Tony.
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.
He wipes out
half the population.
He sent Loki.
The attack on New York,
that's him.
This is it.
What's our timeline?
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.
That already makes him
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...
He could destroy life
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Is that what it is?
I'm going to allow that.
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?
No can do.
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.
And I swore off dairy...
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.
A bit chalky.
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.
Point is, things change.
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.
Yeah, so conversely,
it may also be
his best chance against us.
Well, if we don't do our jobs.
What is your job exactly?
Besides making
balloon animals.
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?
The fact is
we have this stone.
We know where it is.
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...
and we have to find him now.
Yeah, that's the thing.
What do you mean?
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.
He's offline.
- What?
- Yeah.
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.
Who could find Vision then?
Shit.
Probably Steve Rogers.
Oh, great.
Maybe.
But...
Call him.
It's not that easy.
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?
No.
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.
Broke up?
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?
Cap and I fell out hard.
We're not on speaking terms.
Tony, listen to me.
Thor's gone.
Thanos is coming.
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.
Flip phone.
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be
moving your hair, would ya?
Not at the moment, no.
You okay?
- Help him!
- Banner!
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!
Friday, what am I looking at?
Not sure.
I'm working on it.
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone
in your back pocket, Doc!
Might wanna use it.
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.
Holy shit.
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!
What's the matter
with you kids?
You never seen
a spaceship before?
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.
Notify first responders.
Will do.
Hear me and rejoice.
You are about to die
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.
Be thankful...
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.
You better pack it up
and get outta here.
Stonekeeper.
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.
He means get lost, Squidward.
He exhausts me.
Bring me the stone.
Banner, you want a piece?
Mmm, no, not really.
But when do I ever get
what I want?
That's right.
Okay. Push!
It's been a while.
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.
Okay. Shh.
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.
Come on, come on, man.
God!
Where's your guy?
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.
It's okay.
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.
- I have him.
- Damn it.
Where'd that come from?
It's nanotech.
You like it?
A little something I...
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend
won't be joining us...
Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.
It stays with me.
Exactly. Bye.
Tony, you okay?
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?
I'm trying. He won't come out.
Hammer.
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?
Come out! Come out! Come out!
No!
What do you mean, "no"?
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?
Uh, he's from space.
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.
Your powers are quaint.
You must be popular
with children.
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.
You'll only wish
you were dead.
No!
Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.
On it!
Not cool.
Gotcha!
Wait!
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.
Hang on, kid.
Oh!
Ugh.
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.
Give me a little juice,
Friday.
Unlock 17:A.
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.
But you said
save the wizard!
I can't breathe.
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.
Yeah. That makes sense.
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!
Happy trails, kid.
- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.
Oh, come on!
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.
Tony? Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
What's going on?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.
Why?
Just 'cause
I'll probably
not make it back for a while.
Tell me
you're not on that ship.
Yeah.
God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.
Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.
- Pep.
- Come back here right now.
Come back.
Boss,
we're losing her.
I'm going too.
Oh, my God!
I shoulda stayed on the bus.
Where you going?
The Time Stone's been taken.
The Sanctum remains unguarded.
What will you do?
I'm gonna make a call.
Sing it, Drax!
Why are we doing this again?
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.
Someone could be dying.
I get that,
but why are we doing it?
'Cause we're nice.
And maybe whoever it is
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...
We take his ship.
- Exactly!
- Bingo!
All right!
We are arriving.
All right, Guardians,
don't forget
this might be dangerous...
so let's put on
our mean faces.
Groot, put that
thing away, now.
I don't wanna tell you again.
Groot.
I am Groot!
- Whoa!
- Language!
- Hey!
- Wow.
You got some
acorns on you, kid.
Ever since
you got a little sap,
you're a total d-hole.
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Looks like
we're not getting paid.
Wipers! Wipers!
Get it off.
How the hell
is this dude still alive?
He is not a dude.
You're a dude.
This... This is a man.
A handsome, muscular man.
I'm muscular.
But who are you
kidding, Quill?
You're one sandwich
away from fat.
Yeah, right.
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.
What?
Gamora, do you think I'm...
He is anxious, angry.
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.
Wow.
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?
It's like his muscles
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.
Stop massaging his muscles.
Wake him up.
Wake.
Who the hell are you guys?
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.
To bring balance
to the universe
by wiping out
half of all life.
He used to kill people
planet by planet,
massacre by massacre.
Including my own.
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.
Your father killed my brother.
Oh, boy.
Stepfather, technically.
And she hates him
as much as you do.
Families can be tough.
Before my father died,
he told me
that I had a half-sister...
that he imprisoned in Hel.
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.
So I had to kill her.
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.
Goes round and round and...
I feel your pain.
I feel your pain as well,
because...
I mean,
it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.
My father killed my mother.
And then I had to kill
my father.
That was hard.
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...
I need a hammer, not a spoon.
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.
No, you're not.
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?
- No.
- You are.
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.
No, I'm not.
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.
Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.
He's trying to copy me.
I need you to stop doing that.
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.
We need to stop Thanos.
Which means
we need to find out
where he's going next.
Knowhere.
He must be going somewhere.
No, no. Knowhere?
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?
Because for years...
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there
with a man
called the Collector.
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...
he's not going
for one of the other stones?
There are six stones
out there.
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.
He stole the Space Stone
from me...
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.
Like Kevin Bacon?
He may be on the team.
I don't know.
I haven't been there
in a while.
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.
No one even knows where it is.
Therefore Thanos can't get it.
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?
That place is a legend.
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons
to ever torment the universe.
I would very much like
to go there, please.
The rabbit is correct
and clearly the smartest
among you.
Rabbit?
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.
I assume
you're the captain, sir.
You're very perceptive.
You seem like a noble leader.
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.
Quiet.
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.
Look, this is my ship.
And I'm not goin' to...
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?
The Thanos-killing kind.
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.
Your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed
into madness.
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.
If we don't go to Knowhere
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...
he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.
We got two ships
and a large assortment
of morons.
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.
And the morons
will go to Knowhere
to try to stop Thanos.
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.
For the record...
I know that
you're going with him
because it's where
Thanos isn't.
You know, you really shouldn't
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.
Come on, Groot.
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.
Bye.
Vis?
Is it the stone again?
It's as if
it's speaking to me.
What does it say?
I don't... I don't know,
but something.
Hey.
Tell me what you feel.
I just feel you.
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...
which would give us more time
together before you went back.
What if
I miss that train?
There's an 11:00.
What if I missed
all the trains?
What if this time
I didn't go back?
But you gave Stark your word.
I'd rather give it to you.
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.
We both made promises.
Not to each other.
Wanda.
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...
trying to see
if this could work and...
I don't know.
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.
I think...
- It works.
- It works.
It works.
Stay.
Stay with me.
Or not. If I'm overstepping...
What are they?
What the stone
was warning me about.
I have to go.
No, Vision.
Vision, if that's true,
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.
Wanda, I...
Vision!
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.
My systems are failing.
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.
Vis!
Give up the stone,
and she lives.
Hands off.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, you gotta get up.
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.
Hey. We have to go.
Please. Please leave.
You asked me to stay.
- I'm staying.
- Please.
- Get up.
- I can't.
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.
You'll never get
the chance again.
Can you stand?
Thank you, Captain.
Let's get you on the jet.
Now, I thought we had a deal.
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.
I'm sorry.
We just wanted time.
Where to, Cap?
Home.
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.
Zehobereians.
Mother! Where's my mother?
Choose a side or die.
Mother!
One side
is a revelation...
the other an honor
known only to a few.
What's wrong, little one?
My mother. Where is my mother?
What's your name?
Gamora.
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.
Come.
Let me help you.
Look.
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.
Too much to one side
or the other...
Here. You try.
Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.
Uh-uh.
Concentrate.
There. You've got it.
Gamora.
Do you know if these grenades
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?
Because I was thinking about
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.
But I don't want to
if they're the...
I need to ask a favor.
Yeah, sure.
One way or another,
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.
Which is what
the grenades are for.
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?
If things go wrong...
If Thanos gets me...
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.
What?
I know something he doesn't.
And if he finds it out,
the entire universe
could be at risk.
What do you know?
If I tell you, you'd know too.
If it's so important...
shouldn't I?
Only if you wanna die.
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?
Just...
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would. But you...
Swear to me.
Swear to me on your mother.
Okay.
Okay.
- Oh.
- Dude.
How long have you been
standing there?
An hour.
An hour?
Are you serious?
I've mastered the ability
of standing
so incredibly still...
that I become
invisible to the eye.
Watch.
You're eating a zarg-nut.
But my movement...
was so slow...
that it's imperceptible.
Mmm, no.
I'm sure I'm invisible.
Hi, Drax.
Damn it.
This place looks deserted.
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.
Yep,
I'm picking that up too.
Let's put down right here.
I don't have it.
Everyone
in the galaxy knows
you'd sell your own brother...
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...
to your pathetic collection.
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.
I told you.
I sold it.
Why would I lie?
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.
Like suicide.
You do understand.
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.
I didn't know what it was.
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.
It's him.
Last chance,
charlatan.
Where's the stone?
Today...
Drax. Drax.
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.
Drax, wait.
Not yet, not yet, not yet.
Drax.
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.
He doesn't have the stone yet.
If we get it,
then we can stop him.
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.
No.
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.
Sleep.
Okay.
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.
The other right.
Why?
Why you, daughter?
That was quick.
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!
Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.
But one never knows for sure.
Reality is often
disappointing.
That is, it was.
Now...
reality can be
whatever I want.
You knew I'd come.
I counted on it.
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.
Thanos!
No!
Let her go, Grimace.
Peter.
I told you to go right.
Now? Really?
You let her go!
Ah, the boyfriend.
No.
Like to think of myself
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.
- Let her go.
- Peter.
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.
Not him.
You promised. You promised.
Oh, daughter.
You expect too much from him.
She's asked, hasn't she?
Do it.
Mmm.
Do it!
I told you to go right.
I love you more than anything.
I love you too.
I like him.
Still no word from Vision?
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.
On a stolen Quinjet
with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.
You know they're
only criminals because
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?
My God, Rhodes.
Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.
If it weren't
for those Accords,
Vision would've been
right here.
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.
That's right.
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.
You have second thoughts?
Not anymore.
Mr. Secretary.
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.
You could use
some of that right now.
The world's on fire.
And you think all is forgiven?
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.
And I'm way past
asking permission.
Earth just lost
her best defender.
So we're here to fight.
And if you wanna
stand in our way...
we'll fight you too.
Arrest them.
All over it.
That's a court-martial.
It's great to see you, Cap.
You too, Rhodey.
Hey.
Wow. You guys...
really look like crap.
Must've been
a rough couple years.
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.
Uh, I think
you look great.
Uh...
Yeah, I'm back.
Hi, Bruce.
Nat.
This is awkward.
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?
And they can clearly find us.
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?
After the whole
Accords situation,
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough
on their families.
They're on house arrest.
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?
Okay, look.
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...
Vision's stone.
Then we have to protect it.
No, we have to destroy it.
I've been giving
a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head.
About its nature.
But also its composition.
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...
its molecular integrity
could fail.
Yeah, and you with it.
We're not having
this conversation.
Eliminating the stone
is the only way
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.
That's too high a price.
Only you have
the power to pay it.
Thanos threatens
half the universe.
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.
But it should.
We don't trade lives, Vision.
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...
to save how many
millions of people?
Tell me,
why is this any different?
Because you might
have a choice.
Your mind is made up
of a complex construct
of overlays.
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.
All of them mixed together,
all of them
learning from one another.
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.
Perhaps the best parts.
Can we do that?
Not me, not here.
Well,
you better find someone
and somewhere fast.
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys
have your old rooms back.
I know somewhere.
The Kingsguard
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.
And the Border Tribe?
Those that are left.
Send word
to the Jabari as well.
M'Baku likes a good fight.
And what of this one?
This one may be tired of war.
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.
Where's the fight?
On its way.
In all the time
I've served Thanos...
I have never failed him.
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...
with the Time Stone
still attached
to your vaguely
irritating person...
there would be judgment.
Give me...
the stone.
Wow, you're a seriously
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?
Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...
What the...
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.
God damn it.
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.
And now, I'm here in space.
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.
This is a one-way ticket.
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.
No, I did think this through.
You could not have possibly
thought this through.
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...
if there's no neighborhood.
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,
but you know
what I'm trying to say.
Come on. We got a situation.
See him down there?
He's in trouble.
What's your plan?
- Go.
- Um...
Okay, okay... Uh...
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?
Painful, aren't they?
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.
And any one of them...
could end your friend's life
in an instant.
I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.
You've saved nothing.
Your powers
are inconsequential
compared to mine.
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.
Yes! Wait.
What are those?
Hey,
we haven't officially met.
Cool.
We gotta turn
this ship around.
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.
No, I want to protect
the stone.
And I want you
to thank me.
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.
I seriously don't know
how you fit your head
into that helmet.
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.
I tried to bench you.
You refused.
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.
And due to that fact,
we're now
in a flying doughnut...
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.
What is he, your ward?
No.
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...
I'm Spider-Man, then.
This ship is
self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.
Can we control it?
Fly us home?
- Stark?
- Yeah.
Can you get us home?
Yeah, I heard you.
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.
Under no circumstances
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.
I don't think
you quite understand
what's at stake here.
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.
Since he sent an army
to New York
and now he's back.
And I don't know what to do.
So I'm not so sure
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.
So I say we take
the fight to him.
Doctor.
Do you concur?
All right, Stark.
We go to him.
But you have to understand...
if it comes to saving you
or the kid
or the Time Stone...
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.
Nice. Good, moral compass.
We're straight.
All right, kid.
You're an Avenger now.
I thought
you might be hungry.
I always hated that chair.
So I've been told.
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.
I hated this room.
This ship.
I hated my life.
You told me that too.
Every day.
For almost 20 years.
I was a child
when you took me.
I saved you.
No.
No. We were happy
on my home planet.
Going to bed hungry...
scrounging for scraps.
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.
Do you know
what's happened since then?
The children born...
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.
Because you murdered
half the planet.
A small price to pay
for salvation.
You're insane.
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.
It needs correction.
You don't know that!
I'm the only one
who knows that.
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.
For a time...
you had that same will...
as you fought by my side.
Daughter.
I'm not your daughter.
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.
And, in doing so,
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
I am disappointed.
But not because
you didn't find it.
But because you did.
And you lied.
Nebula.
Don't do this.
Some time ago,
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.
Please don't do this.
And very nearly succeeded.
So I brought her here.
To talk.
Stop. Stop it.
I swear to you on my life.
I never found the Soul Stone.
Accessing memory files.
You know
what he's about to do.
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.
- All of them.
- He can never get them all.
He will!
He can't, Nebula.
Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...
and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.
You're strong.
Me.
You're generous.
Me.
But I never taught you to lie.
That's why
you're so bad at it.
Where is the Soul Stone?
Vormir!
The stone is on Vormir.
Show me.
I am Groot.
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking.
What's there to see?
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.
I am Groot.
Tree, pour what's in the cup
out into space
and go in the cup again.
You speak Groot?
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.
I am Groot.
You'll know when we're close.
Nidavellir's forge harnesses
the blazing power
of a neutron star.
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.
It's truly awesome.
Okay, time to be the captain.
So, dead brother, huh?
Yeah, that could be annoying.
Well, he's been dead before.
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.
And you said
your sister and your dad?
Both dead.
But still got a mom, though?
Killed by a dark elf.
A best friend?
Stabbed through the heart.
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?
Absolutely.
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...
they're all
tremendous motivators.
They really clear the mind.
So I'm good to go.
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...
he's the toughest there is.
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.
He's never fought me twice.
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.
It better be some hammer.
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,
but none succeeded.
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.
Fate wills it so.
Mmm-hmm.
And what if you're wrong?
If I'm wrong, then...
what more could I lose?
I could lose a lot.
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.
Okay.
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?
- What's it look like?
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.
He gave you his eye?
No, he gave me 100 credits.
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.
Thank you, sweet rabbit.
Hmm.
Huh?
Oh.
I would've washed that.
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...
Hey, we're here!
I don't think
this thing works.
Everything seems dark.
It ain't the eye.
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.
And the rings are frozen.
I hope
these dwarves are better
at forging
than they are cleaning.
Maybe they realized
that they live
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?
Yes, why?
It look
anything like that?
I am Groot.
Go back to the pod.
Eitri, wait!
Stop!
Stop.
Thor?
What happened here?
You were supposed
to protect us.
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.
Asgard is destroyed.
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.
I made what he wanted.
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.
Then he killed
everyone anyway.
All except me.
"Your life is yours," he said.
"But your hands
are mine alone."
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.
Every weapon
you've ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword...
it's all inside your head.
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.
Mantis, listen very carefully.
I need you
to meet me on Titan.
Hey, what's going on?
I think we're here.
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.
Close those around it.
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.
We might wanna turn.
Turn! Turn! Turn!
You all right?
That was close.
I owe you one.
Let me just say, if aliens
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.
I do not want another
single pop culture reference
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.
Thanos!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!
Stay down, clown.
Die, blanket of death!
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.
Where is Gamora?
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!
Do it, Quill! I can take it.
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.
I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.
Starting with you.
Wait, what, Thanos?
All right, let me ask you
this one time.
What master do you serve?
What master do I serve?
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?
You're from Earth.
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.
Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?
So you're not
with Thanos?
With Thanos?
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.
You're the ones
Thor told us about.
You know Thor?
Yeah.
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.
Where is he now?
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?
It's a mold.
A king's weapon.
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.
Did it have a name?
Stormbreaker.
That's a bit much.
So how do we make it?
You'll have to restart
the forge.
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.
Rabbit, fire up the pod.
The hell happened
to this planet?
It's eight degrees
off its axis.
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.
Or at least
the beginnings of one.
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,
pin him down,
get what we need.
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.
We just want the gauntlet.
Are you yawning?
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?
Did you hear what I said?
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?
Kick names, take ass.
Yeah, that's right.
All right, just get over here,
please.
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.
We gotta coalesce.
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...
and that way
it might be really good.
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.
Like in Footloose, the movie?
Exactly like Footloose.
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?
It never was.
Don't encourage this,
all right?
- Okay.
- We're getting no help
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?
By the way,
that's a compliment.
Don't forget, I'm half human.
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...
that's 100% you.
Your math
is blowing my mind.
Excuse me.
But does your friend
often do that?
Strange, we all right?
You're back. You're all right.
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.
To see all
the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.
How many did you see?
14,000,605.
How many did we win?
One.
The stone
had better be up there.
For your sister's sake.
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
You know us?
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.
Where is the Soul Stone?
You should know...
it extracts a terrible price.
I am prepared.
We all think that at first.
We are all wrong.
How is it you know
this place so well?
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out,
banished me here.
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.
What you seek
lies in front of you.
As does what you fear.
What's this?
The price.
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.
Tell me what it needs.
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...
understands its power...
the stone demands a sacrifice.
Of what?
In order to take the stone,
you must lose
that which you love.
A soul...
for a soul.
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...
a moment...
when you got
what you deserved.
And I was always
so disappointed.
But now...
You kill and torture...
and you call it mercy.
The universe has judged you.
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.
You failed.
And do you wanna know why?
Because you love nothing.
No one.
No.
Really?
Tears?
They're not for him.
No.
This isn't love.
I ignored my destiny once.
I cannot do that again.
Even for you.
I'm sorry, little one.
No!
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.
I hope you're right
about this.
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda
to the rest of the world...
this is not what I imagined.
And what did you imagine?
The Olympics.
Maybe even a Starbucks.
Should we bow?
Yeah, he's a king.
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.
What are you doing?
Uh, we don't do that here.
So how big of an assault
should we expect?
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.
How we looking?
You will have my Kingsguard,
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.
How you been, Buck?
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.
Whoa.
The structure is polymorphic.
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.
Why didn't you just reprogram
the synapses
to work collectively?
Because we didn't think of it.
I'm sure you did your best.
Can you do it?
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.
It will take time, brother.
How long?
As long as you can give me.
Something's entered
the atmosphere.
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.
God, I love this place.
Yeah, don't
start celebrating yet, guys.
We got more incoming
outside the dome.
It's too late.
We need to destroy
the stone now.
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.
We will hold them off.
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...
you blow it to hell.
I will.
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.
And get this man a shield.
I don't think
you get the scientifics here.
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...
you're gonna need something
a lot bigger
to yank 'em loose.
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...
Fire the engines!
More power, rabbit!
Well done, boy.
That's Nidavellir.
Damn it.
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?
The mechanism
is crippled.
- What?
- With the iris closed,
I can't heat the metal.
How long will it take
to heat it?
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?
I'm gonna hold it open.
That's suicide.
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.
How we looking, Bruce?
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.
Wow! This is amazing, man.
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through
the tree line.
Thank you
for standing with us.
Where's your other friend?
You will pay for his life
with yours.
Thanos will have that stone.
That's not gonna happen.
You are in Wakanda now.
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.
We have blood to spare.
They surrender?
Not exactly.
What the hell?
Looks like we pissed her off.
They're killing themselves.
You see the teeth
on those things?
All right, back up, Sam.
You're gonna get
your wings singed.
Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter
and get in behind us...
there's nothing
between them and Vision.
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.
How do we do that?
We open the barrier.
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.
Requesting
confirmation, My King.
You said open the barrier?
On my signal.
This will be
the end of Wakanda.
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.
Wakanda forever!
Now!
How much longer, Shuri?
I've barely begun, brother.
You might want to pick up
the pace.
Allfathers, give me strength.
You understand, boy?
You're about to take
the full force of a star.
It'll kill you.
Only if I die.
Yes.
That's what killing you means.
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!
Thor! Say something. Come on.
Thor, you okay?
I think he's dying.
He needs the axe!
Where's the handle?
Tree, help me find the handle!
There's too many of 'em!
You guys
are so screwed now!
Bring me Thanos!
Oh, yeah.
You're much more of a Thanos.
I take it the Maw is dead.
This day
extracts a heavy toll.
Still, he accomplished
his mission.
You may regret that.
He brought you face-to-face
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.
And where do you think
he brought you?
Let me guess. Your home?
It was.
And it was beautiful.
Titan was like most planets.
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.
Genocide.
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.
They called me a madman.
And what I predicted
came to pass.
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.
I'm a survivor.
Who wants to murder trillions.
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.
And then what?
I'd finally rest...
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.
Our?
Piece of cake, Quill.
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.
Boom!
Don't let him close his fist.
Magic.
More magic.
Magic with a kick.
Magic with a...
Insect!
Well, well.
You should've killed me.
It would've been
a waste of parts!
Where's Gamora?
Is he under?
Don't let up.
Be quick. He is very strong.
Parker, help! Get over here.
She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.
For the record,
this was my plan.
You're not so strong now, huh?
Where is Gamora?
My Gamora.
No, bullshit!
Where is she?
He is in anguish.
Good.
He... He mourns.
What does
this monster have to mourn?
Gamora.
What?
He took her to Vormir.
He came back
with the Soul Stone.
But she didn't.
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!
Tell me she's lying.
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!
I had to.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!
Oh, God.
Come and get some,
space dogs!
Come on! Get some! Get some!
Come on! Get some!
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.
Okay. How much for the arm?
Oh, I'll get that arm.
New haircut?
Noticed you've copied
my beard.
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.
I am Groot.
I am Steve Rogers.
Fall back! Fall back, now!
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.
I'm doing it.
Why was she up there
all this time?
She's on the field. Take it.
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.
Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him!
- On my way.
He'll die alone. As will you.
She's not alone.
Oh, no, you don't.
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.
What? No! No!
Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!
Hulk? Hulk,
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.
Hulk! Hulk!
Hulk!
No!
Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!
I'll do it myself!
Come on! Yeah!
See ya!
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.
I thought you were formidable,
machine.
But you're dying,
like any man.
Get outta here!
Go!
That was really gross.
I thought I told you to go.
We don't trade lives, Captain.
I got you. I got you.
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.
You're full of tricks, wizard.
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.
A fake.
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.
Stark.
You know me?
I do.
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.
My only curse is you.
Come on!
All that for a drop of blood.
You have my respect, Stark.
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.
I hope they remember you.
Stop.
Spare his life...
and I will give you the stone.
No tricks.
Don't.
One to go.
Where is he?
Did we just lose?
Why would you do that?
We're in the endgame now.
Are you okay?
What? What is it?
He's here.
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.
What the hell?
Cap.
That's him.
Eyes up. Stay sharp.
Wanda.
It's time.
No.
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.
Look at me.
You have the power
to destroy the stone.
Don't.
You must do it. Wanda, please.
We are out of time.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can.
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.
It's not fair.
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.
It's all right.
You could never hurt me.
I just feel you.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I love you.
I understand, my child.
Better than anyone.
You could never.
Today, I lost more
than you can know.
But now is no time to mourn.
Now is no time at all.
No!
I told you...
you'd die for that.
You should have...
You should...
You should have
gone for the head.
No!
Daughter?
Did you do it?
Yes.
What did it cost?
Everything.
What did you do?
What'd you do?
Where'd he go?
Thor.
Where'd he go?
Steve?
Up, General. Up!
This is no place to die.
I am Groot.
Oh...
No, no, no!
Groot! No.
Sam!
Sam, where you at?
Something's happening.
Quill?
Steady, Quill.
Oh, man.
Tony.
There was no other way.
Mr. Stark?
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.
I don't know...
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.
I'm sorry.
He did it.
What is this?
What the hell is happening?
Oh, God.
Still no word
from Stark?
No, not yet.
We're watching every satellite
on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.
What is it?
Multiple bogeys
over Wakanda.
Same energy signature
as New York?
Ten times bigger.
Tell Klein
we'll meet him at...
Nick! Nick!
They okay?
There's no one here.
Call Control.
Code red.
Nick.
Hill.
Oh, no.
Mother...
BOY: Baba...
MAN: Yes, my son.
BOY: Tell me a story.
MAN: (CHUCKLES) Which one?
The story of home.
Millions of years ago...
a meteorite
made of vibranium...
the strongest substance
in the universe...
struck the continent
of Africa...
affecting the plant life
around it.
And when
the time of man came...
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...
until a warrior shaman...
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...
a plant that granted him
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.
The warrior became king...
and the first Black Panther...
the protector of Wakanda.
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...
more advanced
than any other nation.
But as Wakanda thrived...
the world around it descended
further into chaos.
To keep vibranium safe...
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...
keeping the truth
of their power
from the outside world.
And we still hide, Baba?
Yes.
BOY: Why?
(IN THE TRUNK
BY TOO $HORT PLAYING)
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!
Whatever!
Get outta here!
Check up.
Pick your man up! He open.
Where you at?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Pass! Pass!
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!
Watch me get this.
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.
KID: Come on.
BOY: What you got?
You ain't got nothing.
MAN: Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,
won't be no worries.
You in the van,
come in through from the west.
Come around the corner.
- Land right here.
- Mmm-hmm.
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...
(FAINT RUSTLING)
Hide the straps.
Yo, is it the Feds?
No.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.
They're holding spears.
Open it.
JAMES: You serious?
They won't knock again.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Prove to me you are one of us.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
My King.
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.
As you wish.
At ease.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Come, baby brother.
how you are holding up.
You look strong.
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.
How is home?
Not so good.
(IN XHOSA) Baby brother.
There has been an attack.
This man...
Ulysses Klaue...
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.
Many lives were lost.
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...
and how to strike.
He had someone on the inside.
Why are you here?
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.
I did no such thing.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Tell him who you are.
Zuri, son of Badu...
What?
James. James, you lied to me?
Leave him.
You were Wakandan
this whole time?
You betrayed Wakanda!
How could you lie
to me like...
Stand down.
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?
Prince N'Jobu...
you will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
Check up!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Guard your man,
guard your man!
Yo.
REPORTER:
The tiny nation of Wakanda
is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.
The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...
after a terrorist attack
at the United Nations
a week ago.
The suspect
has since been apprehended.
Though it remains one of
the poorest countries
in the world...
fortified by
mountain ranges...
and an impenetrable
rainforest...
Wakanda does not engage
in international trade
or accept aid.
The succession
of the throne...
is expected to fall
to the oldest
of the king's two children...
Prince T'Challa.
OKOYE: My Prince...
coming up on them now.
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.
Hmm.
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.
Just don't freeze
when you see her.
What are you talking about?
I never freeze.
(MEN GRUNTING)
MILITANT 1: What's going on?
MILITANT 2: It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.
The car no start.
MILITANT 3: What happened?
MILITANT 4: The engine failed.
MILITANT 1: Ours, too.
What is it, Captain?
- Defense positions.
- (GUNS COCKING)
Defense positions.
MILITANT 2:
Are we under attack?
Defense positions.
Get around to the side.
Defense positions.
Hey. Defense positions!
No games.
(BARKING)
What do you see?
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
- Come in. Come in.
- (SCREAMS)
Over there! Look back!
Watch out!
(ALL SCREAMING AND GRUNTING)
NAKIA: T'Challa, no!
This one's just a boy.
He got kidnapped as well.
BLACK PANTHER: Nakia...
I...
- I wanted...
- MILITANT 1: Hey!
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!
I will shoot her right now.
(GROANS)
You froze.
BLACK PANTHER: Ah...
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.
My father is dead, Nakia.
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.
And I wish for you
to be there.
NAKIA:
Carry yourselves home now.
WOMAN: Thank you.
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.
Thank you oh.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
You will speak
nothing of this day.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
(WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL

OKOYE: Sister Nakia...
My Prince...
we are home.
This never gets old.
(WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL

Queen Mother...
Princess...
My comfort for your loss.
RAMONDA: Thank you, Nakia.
It is so good
to have you back with us.
Take her to
the River Province
to prepare her
for the ceremony.
Yes, General.
Did he freeze?
Like an antelope
in headlights.
(LAUGHING)
Are you finished?
So surprised
my little sister came
to see me off
before our big day.
You wish!
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.
How many times
do I have to teach you?
Just because something works
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.
You are teaching me?
What do you know?
SHURI: More than you.
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...
to your ceremonial outfit.
Shuri!
Sorry, Mother!
How are you
feeling today, Mama?
Proud.
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.
He is with us...
and it is your time
to be king.
Good morning.
How can I help you?
I was just checking out
these artifacts.
They tell me
you're the expert.
Ah. You could say that.
They're beautiful.
Where's this one from?
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...
present day Ghana...
19th century.
For real?
What about this one?
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...
16th century.
Now, tell me about this one.
Also from Benin,
seventh century.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Fula tribe, I believe.
Nah.
I beg your pardon?
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin
but it's from Wakanda.
And it's made
out of vibranium.
(CHUCKLES) Don't trip.
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.
These items aren't for sale.
How do you think
your ancestors got these?
You think they paid
a fair price?
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?
Sir, I'm going to have to
(CLEARS THROAT)
ask you to leave.
You got
all this security in here
watching me
ever since I walked in.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- But you ain't checking for
- what you put in your body.
- (GASPS)
All right, mate.
Let's have it.
- Come on, mate. Time.
- (GRUNTS)
I think she might not
be feeling too good.
Somebody get some help!
Come here!
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!
GUARD: Medical emergency
right away
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.
Look out.
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.
I'm gonna take a break.
MEDIC 1: Let's give the lady
some space, please.
MEDIC 2: Step back,
please, gents.
Step back, please.
(GUARDS GRUNT)
Hey, come here.
Come here. It's okay.
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?
Because it's better to leave
the crime scene
more spread out.
Makes us look like amateurs.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Now then,
let's see if you know
what you're talking about.
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
That's just a taste.
(SNIFFING)
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.
(CHUCKLES) It's already sold!
Whatever you try,
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.
That'll make my day.
I can kill two birds
with one stone.
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

Who scoffs at tradition!
And now you want to

who could not keep

Mmm?
We will not have it.

What is wrong my son?
I am not ready.
Have you not prepared
to be king your whole life?
Have you not trained
and studied,
been by my side?
what I am talking about.
I am not ready
to be without you.
A man who has not prepared
his children
for his own death...
has failed as a father.
Have I ever failed you?
Never.
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.
I want to be
a great king, Baba.
Just like you.
You're going to struggle.
So you'll need to
surround yourself
with people you trust.
You're a good man
with a good heart.
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.
(GASPING)
Breathe.
T'Challa, breathe.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Breathe.
He was there.
(CHUCKLES)
He was there. My father.
(BEREBERE BY IDRISSA SOUMAORO

Just one?
Come home, Nakia.
I'm right here.
Stay.
I came to support you
and to honor your father...
but I can't stay.
I found my calling out there.
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.
I can't be happy here...
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?
Share what we have.
We could provide aid...
and access to technology
and refuge
to those who need it.
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.
If the world found out
what we truly are...
what we possess...
we could lose our way of life.
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others
and protect ourselves
at the same time.
(SIGHS)
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.
- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.
T'CHALLA: Is that him?
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?
W'KABI: Of course.
I see Nakia is back.
You guys going to work it out?
T'Challa...
what's wrong?
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.
More, like what?
Foreign aid, refugee programs.
You let the refugees in...
they bring their problems
with them.
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...
to go out there
and clean up the world,
then I'll be all for it.
But waging war
on other countries
has never been our way.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILLING)
You, too, huh?
Bast! We're in trouble.
My King.
My love.
You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...
in South Korea...
tomorrow night.
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.
We need a king.
My parents were killed
when he attacked.
Not a day goes by
when I do not think
about what Klaue took from us.
From me.
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.
W'KABI: Take me with you.
We'll take him down together,
side by side.
I need you here
protecting the border.
Then I ask...
you kill him
where he stands...
or you bring him back to us.
You have my word.
I will bring him back.
We will proceed
with the mission.
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
My King!
- Stop it. Stop it.
- (CHUCKLES)
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?
Okoye.
And Nakia as well.
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?
Yes.
We'll be fine.
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.
Yes!
I have great things
to show you, Brother.
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.
Unlimited range,
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.
Check these out.
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.
T'CHALLA: Ah.
And what are these?
The real question is
(SHOUTS) what are those?
(CHUCKLES)
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.
I bet the Elders loved that.
(CHUCKLES)
Try them on.
Fully automated.
Like the old American movie
Baba used to watch.
T'CHALLA: Mmm.
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.
Interesting.
Guess what I call them.
Sneakers.
Because you...
Never mind.
If you're going to take
on Klaue...
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.
Exhibit A.
T'CHALLA: My design.
SHURI: Old tech.
- Old?
- Functional, but old.
"Hey, people are shooting
at me.
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."
- Enough.
- (CHUCKLES)
Now, look at these.
Do you like that one?
Tempting.
But the idea
is to not be noticed.
This one.
(TRILLING)
Now tell it to go on.
SHURI: Ooh!
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.
Strike it.
- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not that hard, genius!
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.
I invite you to my lab,
and you just
kick things around?
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.
Hey.
Wait a minute.
SHURI: The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...
and hold it in place
for redistribution.
Very nice.
Strike it again
in the same spot.
(KIMOYO BEADS BEEP)
You're recording?
For research purposes.
(SHURI LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)

this will go quickly...
and I can get this ridiculous

What? It's a disgrace.
(IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia.
Good to see you.
Who are these two?
My friends from Kenya.
Very deep pockets.
They're good.

...like you?
(EXCLAIMS)
Thank you!

is likely already here.

What trouble
was she referring to?
Ah... I got into
a disagreement
with some ivory traders.
- Made a bit of a mess.
- Hmm.
And will there be
any trouble tonight,
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?
Depends...
on how quickly we finish
the mission.

Can we please focus?
Thank you.

I count three.
OKOYE: Five.
How could you miss
Greased Lightning
there behind you?
Six.
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.
It just got
a little more complicated.
Agent Ross.
Your Highness.
You are buying from Klaue.
What I'm doing or not doing...
on behalf of
the U.S. government
is none of your concern.
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.
I gave you Zemo.
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...
that the king of
a third world country
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?
I'd say we were even.
You really need to leave, now.
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.
You've been warned.
CROUPIER: Three, craps.
Hey, you won!
You know what?
I think
I'll just take these...
bring them over here
- and hold on for safekeeping.
- ROSS: Mmm-hmm.
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.
He cannot leave with Klaue.
All right.
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia
links back to a person...
that I'm not actually saying
I'm here to make
a deal with...
but that deal
will not be called off.
When the dust settles,
you and me can work
something out.
I'm not here to make a deal.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING

(DOOR BUZZING AND BEEPING)
Klaue, plus eight!
General.
In position
to secure our exit.
And the vibranium?
I don't see it yet.
OKOYE: I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.
There's not supposed to be.
Somebody did not get the memo.
Definitely armed.
Well, that is quite
the entourage.
You got a mixtape coming out?
Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Yeah, actually, there is one.
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.

You think they're for you?
Don't worry.
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,
thank you very much.
OKOYE: Six more. It's a setup.
You got the diamonds?
Okay. That's enough.
- We need to move on Klaue.
- T'CHALLA: Stand down.
We can't afford a shootout.
Vibranium?
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.
It's now or never.
(IN XHOSA) Stand down!
Hey!
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
(GRUNTING)
(CROWD SCREAMING)
Wakandans! They're here!
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
ROSS: Get outta here!
KLAUE: Kill 'em all!
Diamonds, quick!
(ALL GRUNTING)
(YELLS)
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Murderer!
(GUN CLICKING)
You know, you look just like
your old man.
(WEAPON POWERING UP)
(GRUNTS)
I made it rain! (LAUGHS)
Let's get out of here, boss!
That was awesome!
That was awesome!
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!
- Do we just leave him?
- He'll catch up.
(DEVICE BEEPS)
Shuri!
Yes!
AUTOMATED VOICE: Remote
driving system activated.
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?
T'CHALLA: For Bast's sake!
- Just drive!
- Okay, calm down!
Whoo! Let's go!
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?
(UPBEAT RAP MUSIC PLAYING
ON STEREO)
Which one is he in now?
Hey, split up!
- They're trying to lose us.
- I'll take the right.
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.
(TIRES SCREECH)
We're not going to make it!
BLACK PANTHER: Keep going!
Whoo! Brother!
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTS)
Hey, what was that?
BLACK PANTHER: Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.
Guns.
So primitive!
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!
The bullets won't penetrate!
What are you doing?
Just drive.
(MEN YELL)
- Whoo!
- Shit!
Hey, look at your suit.
You've been taking bullets,
charging it up
with kinetic energy.
BLACK PANTHER:
Pull around the truck.
Where'd he go?
You show-off.
There he is!
Hold tight!
(ENGINE REVS)
All right.
Let's have some fun!
(GRUNTING)
(STRAINING)
(PANTING)
Hop in.
Put that spear in the trunk.
BLACK PANTHER: Faster, Shuri.
I'm going as fast as I can!
Take a right! Take a right!
(TIRES SCREECH)
No, no, no!
(GRUNTS) Brother!
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING)
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
(GROANING AND PANTING)
BLACK PANTHER: Klaue!
Did you think we would forget?
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING)
Look at me, murderer!
Where did you get this weapon?
You savages didn't deserve it.
- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.
(IN XHOSA) King!
The world watches.
Let's go, huh?
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)
Yeah.
KLAUE: Hello.
(GIGGLES)
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.
(CACKLING)
(AIR KISSES)
(SPLUTTERING)
So this is a big mess, huh?
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes
than to make a scene here.
After your questioning,
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor
by letting you
even be in here.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
If he touches you again,
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.
Does she speak English?
When she wants to.
Huh.
I'm going in.
When I'm done,
you guys are up.
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.
You see that?
It's called diplomacy.
You're welcome.
(KLAUE SINGS WHAT IS LOVE
BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN
AND JUNIOR TORELLO)
- Okoye.
- (SCOFFS)
Play nice.
Americans.
(KLAUE CONTINUES SINGING)
(ROSS CLEARS THROAT)
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.
I'm much more your speed.
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.
Where'd you get that?
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.
But I can get you one,
if you like.
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,
and I'll ask them.
He's right outside.
Why don't you
ask him yourself?
What? T'Challa?
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?
Bingo.
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?
ROSS: Um...
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.
KLAUE: (ON EARPIECE)
It's all a front.
Explorers searched for it
for centuries.
El Dorado, the Golden City.
They thought they could
find it in South America...
but it was in Africa
the whole time.
A technological marvel.
All because it was built
on a mound
of the most valuable metal
known to man.
Isipho, they call it.
The gift.
Vibranium.
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.
It's not just a metal.
They sew it
into their clothes.
It powers their city,
their tech...
their weapons.
Weapons?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.
That's a nice fairy tale,
but Wakanda is
a third world country...
and you stole
all their vibranium.
(LAUGHING) I stole...
All of it?
I took a tiny piece of it.
They have
a mountain full of it.
They've been mining it
for thousands of years...
and they still haven't
scratched the surface.
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it
and got out of there alive.
If you don't believe me,
you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.
What his claws are made of.
(BEEPING)
Your father told the UN...
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.
But now he's telling me
you have more.
And you believe the word
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?
(TRUCK BEEPING)
(IN KOREAN) Where is that?
Back there.
How much more are you hiding?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Something is happening
out back.
(YELLS)
Get down!
- (KLAUE YELLING)
- Stand down!
MAN 1: Cover!
MAN 2: Grenade!
I see you took your time,
didn't you? (LAUGHS)
(OKOYE SPEAKING XHOSA)
My King!
My King.
Nakia.
He just jumped in front of me.
(LABORED BREATHING
AND GRUNTING)
I don't think
he'll make it here.
It hit his spine.
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)
This will stabilize him
for now.
(ROSS GRUNTING SOFTLY)
(EXHALING DEEPLY)
Give him to us.
We can save him.
OKOYE: Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.
We failed.
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?
He took a bullet for me.
OKOYE: That was his choice.
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?
Let us consider
that we heal him.
It is his duty to report back
to his country.
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.
I cannot just let him die...
knowing we can save him.
Where exactly
are we taking him?
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.
This is going to be fun.
He will live.
- (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
- (MUSIC STOPS)
W'Kabi is here.
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?
He's not here.
(SIGHS)
He slipped through our hands.
"Slipped"?
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.
With you,
I thought it'd be different.
But it's more of the same.
Let's get going, boss.
You always sell to the CIA?
I sell to the highest bidder.
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...
and I lay low for a bit,
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.
I know you good for it.
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.
You don't want to
go there, boy.
Yeah, I do.
KLAUE: Drop it!
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine
ends today.
Put your gun down now!
I'm sorry.
- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.
(KLAUE GROANS)
(GROANS)
(KLAUE PANTING)
You really want to go
to Wakanda?
They're savages.
This is what they do
to people like us.
KILLMONGER: I ain't worried
about no brand.
Check these out.
Each one is for a kill.
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.
(CHUCKLING)
T'CHALLA: Leave us!
So your mission did not go
as planned.
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?
My father told me
he disappeared.
There was a man today...
wearing a ring
identical to this one.
That is not possible.
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!
My grandfather's ring!
Do not tell me
what is possible.
Tell me the truth!
Some truths...
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.
That is not your choice
to make.
What happened to him?
I promised the king
to say nothing.
I am your king now!
Your uncle took...
a War Dog assignment
in America.
Your father...
placed me there...
to observe...
unbeknownst to him.
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.
They had a child.
The hardships he saw there...
radicalized your uncle.
I observed
for as long as I could.
Their leaders
have been assassinated.
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.
All over the planet...
our people suffer because
they don't have the tools
to fight back.
With vibranium weapons,
they could overthrow
every country...
and Wakanda could
rule them all
the right way.
He knew your father
would not support this.
So, your uncle betrayed us.
No!
He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.
No, no, no.
You will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
ZURI: He drew his weapon
on me.
- No!
- (GRUNTING)
ZURI: Your father
killed his own brother...
to save my life.
Speak nothing of this.
And the child?
We left him.
We had to...
maintain...
the lie.
What is this?
Just a little gift.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
(GRUNTING)
All right, where am I?
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!
(STAMMERS) What?
My name is Everett.
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...
former air force pilot
and now CIA.
Right.
Okay, is this Wakanda?
No, it's Kansas.
How long ago was Korea?
SHURI: Yesterday.
I don't think so.
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
They do here.
But not by magic,
by technology.
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.
ROSS: These train things...
that's magnetic levitation,
right?
Obviously.
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.
The light panels,
what are they?
- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?
In its raw form...
vibranium is too dangerous
to be transported
at that speed...
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.
ROSS: There's vibranium
on those trains?
There's vibranium
all around us.
That's how I healed you.
(CHUCKLES)
Where is T'Challa?
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.
A man showed up at the border
who claims
to have killed Klaue.
What?
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.
We need to find your brother!
An outsider?
No, a Wakandan.
He's not a Wakandan.
He's one of ours.
He killed his own brother...
and left a child behind...
with nothing.
What kind of king...
What kind of man does that?
No man is perfect.
Not even your father.
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...
he may have created something
even worse.
Hey.
Look at me.
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
Brother, you need to
get here now!
ROSS: Erik Stevens.
Graduated Annapolis age 19...
MIT for grad school.
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,
like it was a video game.
Started calling him
Killmonger.
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.
They will drop off the grid...
so they can
commit assassinations
and take down governments.
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?
SHURI: He has
a War Dog tattoo...
but we have no record of him.
Is this man Wakandan or not?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Tell us what is going on.
Speak.
I'm standing in your house...
serving justice to a man
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand
is because I know who you are.
Now, what do you want?
I want the throne.
(LAUGHS AND SPEAKS XHOSA)
My goodness.
(TRIBES' ELDERS LAUGHING)
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.
Must feel good.
It's about two billion people
all over the world
that looks like us.
But their lives
are a lot harder.
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.
And what tools are those?
Vibranium. Your weapons.
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...
for people
who are not our own.
Not your own?
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?
So ain't all people
your people?
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.
And it is my responsibility
to make sure
our people are safe...
and that vibranium
does not fall
into the hands
of a person like you.
KILLMONGER: Mmm...
RAMONDA: Son.
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.
Reject his request.
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.
An American black operative.
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.
That's not my name, Princess.
Ask me, King.
No.
Ask me.
Take him away.
(IN XHOSA) Who are you?
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.
Son of N'Jobu?
with Panther claws
in his chest!
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.
(IN XHOSA) You're lying!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.
RIVER TRIBE ELDER:
(GASPS) What?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
The descendent of N'Jobu.
I'm exercising my blood right
to challenge
for the mantles of king...
and Black Panther.
Do not do this, T'Challa.
BORDER TRIBE ELDER:
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,
he is within his rights.
He has no rights here!
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.
Weeks? I don't need weeks.
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?
I accept your challenge.
SHURI:
He'll never beat T'Challa.
He should've just come
to the first challenge
and gotten it over with.
(UPBEAT DRUMMING)
ZURI: The king
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther
stripped away.
(LABORED BREATHING)
Where is Agent Ross?
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.
This is your last chance.
Throw down your weapons,
and we can handle this
another way.
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.
I trained, I lied, I killed...
just to get here.
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...
Iraq.
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters
right here on this continent.
And all this death...
just so I could kill you.
Let the challenge begin.
- (FAST-TEMPO DRUMMING)
- (GRUNTING)
Yield!
(GROANS)
(T'CHALLA GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
Snap out of it, T'Challa!
(GRUNTING AND GROANING)
(YELLS)
(GASPS)
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
Come on, get up.
Come here.
This is for my father.
ZURI: Erik!
- Zuri, no.
- Stop!
- Zuri!
- Zuri, don't!
I am the cause of
your father's death.
Not him.
Take me.
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.
No!
No! No!
Zuri, no!
(GROANS)
No!
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!
No! No!
(YELLING)
Is this your king? Huh?
(T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
Is this your king?
The Black Panther,
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?
Come on, Brother!
Is there nothing
that can be done?
- (T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
- Him?
He's supposed to protect you?
- No.
- No!
No!
Nah. I'm your king.
- No! No!
- We have to go now!
Queen Mother, let's go!
(RAMONDA CRYING)
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?
- Yes.
- (SIGHS)
(IN XHOSA) Thank you.
to them immediately.
(IN XHOSA) I cannot.
Though my heart is with you.
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man
who showed up here
only hours ago.
He is of royal blood.
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.
Does that really matter?
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.
Overthrow?
Nakia!
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.
What are you loyal to?
I loved him.
I loved my country, too.
Then you serve your country.
No. I save my country.
What's wrong?
The king is dead.
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.
First Baba.
And now my brother.
(CRYING) Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.
(RAMONDA SIGHS)
- (WHISPERS) It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.
Where's Okoye?
Okoye is not coming.
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.
Wait here.
What has happened
to our Wakanda?
(CHANTING SOFTLY)
SHAMAN:
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.
(SOBBING QUIETLY)
N'JOBU: What did I tell you
about going into my things?
Hmm?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
What did you find?
Your home.
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.
Yes. The sunsets there
are the most beautiful
in the world.
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.
Why?
They will say you are lost.
But I'm right here.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
No tears for me?
Everybody dies.
It's just life around here.
Well, look at what
I have done.
I should've taken you back
long ago.
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.
That's why they can't find us.
(GASPING)
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?
This all of it?
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,
we will be ready.
Another king?
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...
(CHOKING)
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.
(YELPS)
(BOTH GASP)
Burn it all!
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
You know, where I'm from...
when black folks
started revolutions,
they never had
the firepower...
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.
Where was Wakanda?
Hmm?
Yeah, all that ends today.
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.
Already in place.
I know how colonizers think.
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.
And their children.
And anyone else
who takes their side.
It's time they know
the truth about us!
We're warriors!
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.
OKOYE: Wakanda has survived
for so long...
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.
But the world is changing,
General.
Elders, it is getting smaller.
The outside world
is catching up...
and soon it will be
the conquerors
or the conquered.
I'd rather be the former.
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.
ROSS: So where are we
going again?
NAKIA: We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb
to Jabariland.
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.
Nakia.
I don't like this.
The Herb belongs to us.
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.
I am a spy with no army.
I wouldn't stand a chance.
(SIGHS)
We'll go.
Oh, boy.
(SHUSHES)
(MEN CHANTING AND GRUNTING)
ROSS: Oh, shit.
Look down. Stay calm.
Shuri.
Look down.
My son...
was murdered in ritual combat.
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...
(GRUNTS)
- The new king...
- (MEN GRUNTING)
M'BAKU: You cannot talk!
One more word,
and I will feed you
to my children.
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.
(LAUGHING)
NAKIA: Great Gorilla M'Baku...
this is why we are here.
To offer this to you.
An outsider
sits on our throne.
Only you can help us stop him.
Come with me.
- (GASPS)
- Impossible!
(RAMONDA GASPING)
Is he breathing?
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.
One of our fishermen found him
at the edge
of the river border.
He brought him to me.
Why do you have him
in the snow?
It is the only thing
keeping him
from joining the ancestors.
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.
Nakia, the Herb.
I call upon the ancestors.
I call upon Bast.
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.
Heal him.
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!
Okay.
(IN XHOSA)
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Wake up, T'Challa.
Wake up.
(T'CHAKA SPEAKS XHOSA)
My son.
for you to come home...
and be reunited with me.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Why?
bring the boy home?
Why, Baba?
He...
He was the truth
I chose to omit.
You were wrong to abandon him.
I chose my people.
I chose Wakanda.
Our future depended...
You were wrong!
All of you were wrong!
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!
We let the fear
of our discovery
stop us from doing
what is right!
No more!
I cannot stay here with you.
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.
He is a monster
of our own making.
I must take the mantle back.
I must!
I must right these wrongs.
- (T'CHALLA GASPS)
- (RAMONDA EXCLAIMING)
(SHIVERING)
Do you have a blanket?
NAKIA: Killmonger
has the full support
of our military.
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.
ROSS: Of course he did.
That's what he was
trained to do.
His unit used to work
with the CIA
to destabilize
foreign countries.
They would always strike
at transitions of power...
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.
You get control of government,
the military...
- Our resources.
- ROSS: Right.
The Great Mound.
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.
He will send our weapons
all over the world.
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.
- What?
- What about you?
The challenge
will have to continue.
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.
It is my duty
to keep you safe.
If he gets control
of our technology,
nowhere will be safe.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
The Black Panther lives.
And when he fights

What? You're gonna need

Thank you.
I owed you a great debt.
A life for a life.
Consider it paid.
Please allow my mother
to stay here.
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.
You know, I could use
an army as well.
I bet you could. (LAUGHS)
But no.
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.
It is our cause.
- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...
and now you speak of "us"?
I cannot speak for past kings.
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.
We both know the power
of vibranium.
If Killmonger
gains control of it,
who do you think
he will come for next?
We will not help you.

Everything is on schedule.
Have the spies been alerted?
Yes. Some resistance

But the War Dogs in London,

We'll strike there first.
The others'll come around.

A handheld sonic cannon,

And we got thousands of them.
The world's gonna find out

I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.
And for the first time
in our history...
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...
with the outside world.
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.
We cannot.
We must not.
We will work to be an example
of how we...
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...
should treat each other.
Now, more than ever...
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.
We all know the truth.
More connects us
than separates us.
But in times of crisis...
the wise build bridges...
while the foolish
build barriers.
We must find a way...
to look after one another...
as if we were one,
single tribe.

have to offer

No, I actually agree with Drax on this.
That's hardly important right now.
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.

Anulax batteries.

That's nothing like what I just said.
But they're worth

which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.
The cost of transgression is death.

for putting your lives on the line.
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.
Impeccable,

We control the DNA of our progeny...
germinating them in birthing pods.
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.
Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.
For academic purposes.
I would be honored, yes.
In the name of research...
I think that could be pretty, uh...

I'm not into that kind of casual...
Oh, please.

What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

I wasn't.
I don't care if you were.
Well, I feel like you do care.
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
Damn shadow.
There are two types of beings
in the universe...
those who dance, and those who do not.
Mmm-hmm.
I first met my beloved at a war rally.
Oh, God.
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.
Except one woman.
My Ovette.
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.
She wouldn't even tap her foot.
Wouldn't move a muscle.
One might assume she was dead.
That does sound pretty hot.
It would make
my nether regions engorge.
Okay. I get it, yes.
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.
Mmm.
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.
No. It's not ripe yet...
and I hate you.
You hate me?
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.
And yet here you stand, a hero.
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.
I swear.
No.
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days
in a prison on Xandar...
wishing you could.

QUILL: This is weird.
We've got a Sovereign fleet

Probably because Rocket stole

Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!
I was being sarcastic!
Oh, no!
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!
Now I look foolish!
Can we put the bickering on hold...

this massive space battle?
QUILL: More incoming!

What is the delay, Admiral?
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...
and could destroy the entire fleet.
Our concern is their slight

We hired them and they steal from us.
It is heresy of the highest order.
All command modules...
fire with the intent to kill.

What's the nearest habitable planet?
It's called Berhert.

But the access point is 47 clicks away.
And you have to go through

Quill, to make it through that...
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.
Lucky for us, I...
I am.

I was cybernetically engineered

had you flown with

instead of what's between your legs!
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...
I guarantee I could have landed

Peter, we almost died

They're called Harbulary batteries.

I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

How little?
Well, I don't know, like this?
A little one-inch man saved us?
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.
That's how eyesight works,

Don't call me a raccoon!
I'm sorry. I took it too far.
I meant trash panda.
Is that better?

I'm not a fool, Nebula.
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
No, I won't.
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.
I bet it's the one-inch man.

you're wrong.
You broke all our hearts.
Ah, pathetic.

We followed him

who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.
Seems he's goin' soft.
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?
You know I'm right, Kraglin.
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.
RAVAGER: Who the hell is that?
(GRUNTING)
(SIGHS)
Yondu Udonta...
I have a proposition for you.
EGO: I hired Yondu to pick you up...
when your mother passed away.
But instead of returning you...
Yondu kept you.
I have no clue as to why.
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because I was a skinny little kid
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.
It made it easier for thievin'.
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.
DRAX: I thought Yondu was your father.
What? We've been together
this whole time...
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?
You look exactly alike.
One's blue!
No, he's not my father!
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.
- Eat you?
- Yeah.
Oh, that son of a bitch.
How'd you locate us now?
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.
What say we head out there right now?
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.
I promise you...
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.
And there...
I can explain your very special heritage.
Finally get to be...
the father I've always wanted to be.
Excuse me.
I've gotta take a whiz.
I'm not buying it.
Let's go take a walk.
- (WHISTLING)
- (URINATING)
I am Mantis.
What are you doing?
Smiling.
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.
Not if you do it like that.
Oh...
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.
Yes.
- (GRUNTS)

(LAUGHING)
That is called a practical joke!
(BOTH LAUGHING)

I just made it up!
(BOTH CONTINUE LAUGHING)
QUILL: Give me a break!
After all this time,
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...
- you wanna be my dad?
- GAMORA: I hear you.
QUILL: And by the way,
this could be a trap.
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...
But what?
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?
Who?
He owned a magic boat?
David Hasselhoff?
Right.
Not a magic boat. A talking car.
Why did he talk again?
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...
and you would tell
all the other children...
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?
I love that story.
- I hate that story.
- (SIGHS)
It's so sad!
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!
That's my point, Peter.
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?
If he ends up being evil...
we will just kill him.
You're leaving me with that fox?
GAMORA: He's not a fox.
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.
(GRUMBLES)
- Or if you feel like it.
- ROCKET: Okay.
It'll be just a couple of days.
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
DRAX: What if the Sovereign come?
QUILL: There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.
I'm uncertain about parting ways.
God, you're like an old woman.
Because I'm wise?
GAMORA: Why do you have
so much luggage?
DRAX: I don't want Groot
playing with my things.
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?
Because it's working.
(FLEETWOOD MAC'S
"THE CHAIN" PLAYING)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again.
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain.
And if you don't love me now.
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying.
You would never break the chain.
And if you don't love me now.
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying.
You would never break the chain
(DRAX AND QUILL LAUGHING)
QUILL: Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?
Oh...
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.
Your antennae, what are they for?
Their purpose?
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!
I say...
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.
QUILL: Right.
And if it's anything other than...
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.
They are not for feeling doorways.
- (SIGHS)
- (QUILL LAUGHS)
I think...
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.
What are those?
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.
- You read minds?
- No.
Telepaths know thoughts.
Empaths feel feelings.
Emotions.
May I?
All right.
You feel love.
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.
No!
Romantic, sexual love.
No, I don't.
- For her!
- No!
(LAUGHING)
QUILL: Okay.
(QUILL GROANS)
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!
You must be so embarrassed!
(DRAX CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Do me! Do me!
I have never felt such humor!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
So unbelievably uncool.
- Oh, Quill.
- (CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.
I can also alter emotions to some extent.
QUILL: Yeah, like what?
If I touch someone who is sad...
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.
I can make a stubborn person compliant.
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.
Do one of those on me.
Sleep.

(SIGHS)
Hey there, rat!
How's it going, you blue idiot?
Not so bad.
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...
has offered us a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...
because she wants
- to kill y'all.
- (ALL LAUGHING)
Your friend...
There's too many of them.
He needs my help.
If you care about him...
you need to get me out of these bonds.
They are going to kill him!
YONDU: I tell you,
it was pretty easy to find you.
I put a tracer on your ship back there...
during the war over Xandar.
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
(CHUCKLES) Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
Otherwise, you'd what?
We'll take them batteries.
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?
That Priestess offered us a million.
A quarter is only one third of that!
A quarter ain't a third.
A quarter is 25.
No.
GEF: We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.
YONDU: Enough!
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.
KRAGLIN: That ain't right!
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...
you protect him like
none of the rest of us much matter!
ALL: Yeah!
I'm the one what sticks up for you!
Take it easy, Kraglin.

QUILL: Wow.
You have your own planet?
Come on.
No larger than your Earth's Moon.
Humility.
I like it.
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.
(LAUGHING)
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.
What are you exactly?
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.
A Celestial, like a god?
Mmm, small "g," son.
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.
(EGO CHUCKLING)
QUILL: Whoa!
I don't know where I came from exactly.
First thing I remember is flickering...
adrift in the cosmos utterly...
and entirely alone.
Over millions of years...
I learned to control
the molecules around me.
I grew smarter and stronger.
And I continued building from there...
layer by layer...
the very planet you walk on now.
Whoa.
But I wanted more.
I desired...
meaning.
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...
"besides just me," I thought.
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.
I created...
what I imagined biological life
to be like...
down to the most minute detail.
Did you make a penis?
Dude!
What is wrong with you?
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?
He would smush her!
(QUILL GROANS)
I don't need to hear how my parents...
Why?
My father would tell the story
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.
That's disgusting.
It was beautiful.
You Earthers have hang-ups.
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.
Ha! Thank you!
It's not half bad.
- Oh.
- Ugh.
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...
and all the accompanying junk.
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...
as I set out amongst the stars...
until I found...
what I sought.
Life.
I was not alone in the universe after all.
When did you meet my mother?
Not long after.
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.
I called her my river lily.
And from that love, Peter...
you.
I have searched for you for so long.
And when I heard of a man from Earth...
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

It's Taserface?

Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...
- (ROCKET SNICKERING)

I'm sorry. I am so sorry!
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...

in all seriousness saying to yourself...
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?
"Taserface!" (LAUGHING)
- That's how I hear you in my head!
- (ALL SNICKERING)
What was your second choice?
- Scrotum Hat?
- (ALL LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING)
New plan. We're killing you first.
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.
That's enough killing for today.
(RAVAGERS MURMURING)
RAVAGER: She's the daughter
of Thanos.
TASERFACE: I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.
I assure you...
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...
or a talking woodland beast.
I want 10% of the take...
and a couple more things.
KRAGLIN: We got
a whole box of hands...
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.
What are you gonna do with your share?
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me
battle one another in training.
Every time my sister prevailed...
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.
But she won...
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.
So after I murder my sister...
I will buy a warship
with every conceivable
instrument of death.
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...
piece by piece...
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...
I know every single day.
Yeah.
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.
Or a nice hat.
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"
Anyways, happy trails.
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.
Peter...
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.
But you left...
the most wonderful woman ever...
to die alone.
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...
and the light within it...
this form will wither and perish.
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?
I loved your mother, Peter!
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!
I know exactly what that feels like!
I had to watch her die!
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...
I've made many mistakes, Peter.
But you're not one of them.
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...
and the light within.
They are a part of you, Peter.
What do you mean?
Give me your hands, son.
Here.
Hold them like that.
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.
(QUILL EXHALES DEEPLY)
(GASPS)
Yes!
Whoa!
Yes! It's okay.
Just relax. Concentrate.
You can do it. Bring it back.
Yes!
Yes, now shape it.
Feel that energy.
Yes.
You're home.
Peter...
DRAX: How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?
MANTIS: Ego found me
in my larva state.
Orphaned on my homeworld.
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.
So you're a pet?
I suppose.
People usually want cute pets.
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?
I am hideous?
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.
But that's a good thing.
Oh?
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...
you know they love you for who you are.
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.
DRAX: Those pools,
they remind me of a time...
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.
She was like you.
Disgusting?
Innocent.
(SOBS)
(SIGHS)
Drax?
There's something I must tell you.
What's going on?
This gross bug lady is my new friend.
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.
You're not ugly. Drax!
What are you talking about?
GAMORA: Mantis...
can you show us where we'll be staying?
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?
MANTIS: The planet is Ego.
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.
And you're not a flea?
I'm a flea with a purpose.
I help him sleep.
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?
Nothing.
Your quarters are this way.
(BOTH GRUNT)
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.
Okay, Taserface.
Hey, tell the other guys we said...
"Hi," Taserface!
(SIGHS)
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?
No, Gef.
It's too adorable to kill.
Take it to the tailor.
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.
But I was young...
and greedy, and stupid.
Like you stealing those batteries.
That was mostly Drax.
Me and Stakar and the other captains...
we weren't so different from
you and your friends.
The only family I ever had.
When I broke the code...
they exiled me.
This is what I deserve.
Slow down, drama queen.
You might deserve this, but I don't.
We gotta get outta here.
Where's Quill?
He went off with his old man.
- Ego?
- Yeah.
It's a day for dumbass names.
(CHUCKLES)
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.
You like a professional asshole or what?
Pretty much a pro.
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?
He was skinny.
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.
Uh-huh.
I got an idea on how to get outta here.
But we're gonna need your little friend.

Aw, man...
what did they do to you?
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...
the thing I wore on my head.
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.
You got it?
(RAVAGERS SNORING)
That's my underwears.
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.
You have to explain it more careful.
It's a prototype fin.
(SCREECHING)
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.
You explain it this time.
All right.
YONDU: That's Vorker's eye.
He takes it out when he sleeps.
Go. Look again.
But leave the eye here.
Why?
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...
and he's not gonna know...
where his eye is! (LAUGHING)
That's a desk.
We told you it was this big.
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...
with a bunch of severed human toes.
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.
Okay?
What? No!
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.
That's not what I said!
I am Groot.
He's relieved you don't want him to.
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.
I am Groot.
On anyone, not just himself.
I am Groot.
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.
That's why you don't like hats?
This is an important conversation
right now?

Cheers, Sam and Diane...
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...
but never say it because if they do,
the ratings would go down...
sort of thing.
There's no unspoken thing.
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,
then it would be spoken...
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.
No, that's not what I...

That girl Mantis...
she's afraid of something.
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?
I'm not trying...
He's my father. He's blood.
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.
Again, you made me come here!
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?
That's the half I'm worried about.
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.
You were insufferable to begin with.
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.
I'm gonna go outside,

You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!
This is whatever the show is

to open themselves up
to new possibility,
and the other person is a jerk...

I win.
I win. I bested you in combat.
No. I saved your life.
Well, you were stupid enough
to let me live.
You let me live!
I don't need you always
trying to beat me!
I'm not the one that just
flew across the universe
just because I wanted to win.
Do not tell me what I want.
I don't need to tell you what you want!
It's obvious!
You were the one who wanted to win.
And I just wanted a sister!
You were all I had.
But you were the one
who needed to win.
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...
and my brain from my skull...
and my arm from my body...
because of you.
(NEBULA SIGHS)
(LOOKING GLASS' "BRANDY
(YOU'RE A FINE GIRL)" PLAYING)
You all right, son?
I saw your girl stomp off
a little earlier in quite a huff.
Yeah. (SIGHS)
It's fortuitous...
you listening to this song.
- You know...
- Brandy?
By Looking Glass?
(CHUCKLES) A favorite of your mom's.
Yeah, it was.
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.
Perhaps its very greatest.
Yes!
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.
He came on a summer's day.
Bringing gifts from far away.
Like the child I put in your mother...
or the freedom you brought Gamora.
Brandy, you're a fine girl.
What a good wife you would be.
My life, my love.
My lady is the sea.
The sea calls the sailor back.
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...
No, Peter...
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...
as long as the light
burns within the planet.
I'm immortal?
Mmm-hmm.
Really?
Yes! As long as the light exists.
And I can use the light
to build cool things...
like how you made this whole planet?
It might take you
a few million years of practice...
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!
What!
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...
and Heather Locklear.
You can do anything you want.
I'm gonna make some weird shit.
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.
Only we can remake the universe.
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...
and lead it to where it needs to go.
How?
Come with me.
(GASPS)
(SNORING)
Drax, Drax. Drax!
Drax! We need to talk.
I'm sorry.
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.
What?
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.
No, that's not what I...
(RETCHING)
What are you doing?
I'm imagining being with you physically.
Drax...
I don't like you like that.
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.
Hey! There's no need to get personal.
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.
I should have told you earlier.
I'm stupid. You are in danger.
(BOTH PANTING)
What is that?
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.
Everything around us,
including the girl...
Everything is temporary.
We are forever.
Doesn't eternity get boring?
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...
which is why you're here.
I told you how all those years ago...
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...
it was all so...
disappointing.
And that is when I came...
to a profound realization.
My innate desire to seek out other life...
was not so that I could
walk among that life.
Peter...
I have found meaning.
(GASPING)
I see it.
Eternity!
Oh, my God.
We need to get off this planet.
(ALL SCREAMING)
Oh, man.
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.
(ALL SCREAMING)
(BOTH GROAN)
What the hell you doing, boy?
I could tell
by how you talked about him...
this Ego is bad news.
We're here to save Quill.
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?
No. I don't care about those things.
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!
I can lord this over him forever.
(LAUGHING)
What are you laughing at me for?
You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.
I know who you are.
You don't know anything
about me, loser.
I know everything about you.
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.
Shut up!
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...
because just a little bit of love...
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.
I said shut up!
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.
I'm serious, dude!
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...
their own little baby, into slavery.
I know who you are, boy.
Because you're me.
What kind of a pair are we?
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.
All right, okay! Good. Wait.
Fight a what?
(GAMORA YELLS)
Who are you people?
What is this place?
Gamora, let her go!
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?
You are scared.
(MANTIS COUGHING)
I call it the Expansion.
It is my purpose...
and now it is yours as well.
It's beautiful.
Over thousands of years...
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...
on thousands of worlds.
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...
To grow and spread...
covering all that exists...
until everything is...
Me!
What did she do to me?
She already told me everything.
I only had one problem.
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power
for such an enterprise.
But two Celestials...
Well, now, that just might do.
The bodies...
are his children.
EGO: Out of all my labors...
the most beguiling was...
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...
to power the Expansion.
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.
It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.
But one after the other, they failed me.
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.
Until you, Peter.
Out of all my spawn...
only you carried
the connection to the light.
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.
- Then we just go.
- No!
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.
You're right.
We're family.
We leave no one behind.
Except maybe you.
Oh, my God.
For the first time in my existence...
I am truly not alone!
What is it, son?
My friends.
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.
Yes.
We are beyond such things.
Yes.
- Now...
- But my mother...
You said you loved my mother.
And that I did.
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.
And I knew if I returned a fourth...
I'd never leave.
The Expansion...
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.
So, I did what I had to do.
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.
What?
Now, all right...
I know that sounds bad.
(GROANING)
Who in the hell do you think you are?
You killed my mother!
I tried...
so hard...
to find the form...
that best suited you...
and this is the thanks I get?
You really need to grow up.
- (GASPS)
- I wanted to do this together...
but I suppose you'll have to learn
by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!
(TRANSMITTER BEEPING)
Finally! Rocket?
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...
to slice open the Bank of A 'askavaria.

Drop her, Kraglin.

(BABY GROOT GRUNTING)
I told you something didn't feel right.
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.
Well, I came back, didn't I?
Because there's an unspoken thing.
There is no unspoken thing.
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?
We had it under control.
We did not.
That is only an extension...
of his true self.
He will be back soon.
What's Smurfette doing here?
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.
She tried to murder me!
I saved you, you stupid fox!
He's not a fox.
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.
I am Groot.
"Raccoon." Whatever.
How do we kill a Celestial?
There's a center to him.
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...
Some sort of protective shell.
It's in the caverns...
below the surface.
- Yondu?
- (GRUNTS)
(QUILL GRUNTS)
(ALL YELP)
Thrusters are out.
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?
That's what you told me, you old doofus.
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.
You said you were gonna eat me.
That was being funny!
Not to me!
You people have issues.
Of course I have issues.
That's my freakin' father!
Thrusters are back up.
(EGO YELLING)
(ALL GRUNT)
- We should be going up!
- QUILL: We can't!
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.
We have to kill him.
Rocket!
Got it!
QUILL: Whoo-hoo!
So, we're saving the galaxy again?
I guess.
Awesome!
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...
if we're two-time galaxy savers.
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...
and all the animals on the planets.
And the people.
Meh.
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

Tell me why Ego wants you here?
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...
to help destroy the universe.
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.
So, could you?
A little.
I made a ball.
A ball?
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.
You "thought"?
You think when I make this arrow fly...
- I use my head?

Why aren't you firing the lasers?
They blew out the generator.
I think I packed a small detonator.
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.
Well, we got these.
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...
throughout his entire nervous system.
Meaning what?
The entire planet will explode.
We'll have to get out of here fast.
I rigged a timer.
QUILL: Go!
(QUILL GRUNTING)
He's coming.
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?
When he wants. He's too powerful.
I can't!
You don't have to believe in yourself...
because I believe in you.
(GASPING)

I never thought she'd be able to do it...
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.
I don't know how long I can hold him.
ROCKET: The metal's too thick.
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.
QUILL: Well...
That's a terrible idea.
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.
(GROANS) Unbelievable.
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."
(SIGHS) What a day.
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.
That activates it.
Then you push this button...
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.
Now, whatever you do...
don't push this button...
because that will set off
the bomb immediately
and we'll all be dead.
Now, repeat back what I just said.
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.
- I am Groot.
- That's right.
- I am Groot.
- No!
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!
Try again.
Hmm...
- I am Groot.

No! That's exactly what you just said!
How is that even possible?
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?
Point to it.
No!
QUILL: Hey, you're
making him nervous!
Shut up and get me some tape!
Does anybody have any tape out there?
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.
I don't have any tape. Let me check.
Yo, Yondu... Ow!
Do you have any tape?
(QUILL GROANING)
Gamora? Do you have any tape?
Tape!
Never mind. Ow!
Drax, do you have any tape?
- (ROCKET COUGHS)
- Yes, Scotch tape would work.
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,
if you don't have any?
Nobody has any tape!
Not a single person has tape?
Nope!
Did you ask Nebula?
Yes!
Are you sure?
I asked Yondu...
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!
You are wasting a lot of time here!
Whee!
We're all gonna die.
YONDU: Rear thrusters are out again!
- We're done for without that generator!
- (GRUNTS)

perhaps it will provide you solace...
that your deaths

She's just unconscious.
How long until the bomb goes off?
In the unlikely event
that Groot doesn't kill us all...
about six minutes.

T-minus five minutes.

QUILL: I told Gamora...
how when I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.
Earlier, it struck me...
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.
He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...
but he did have the whistle of one.
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...
and hooked up with hot women...
and fought robots.
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.
Only it was you, Yondu.
I had a pretty cool dad.
What I'm trying to say here is...
sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...
it's right there by your side all along.
You don't even know it.
(SNIFFLES)
I am Groot.
He did call you twig.
Nebula...
I was a child like you.
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.
I'm trying to make it right.
There are little girls like you...
across the universe who are in danger.
You can stay with us and help them.
I will help them by killing Thanos.
I don't know if that's possible.

It's called a Zune.
It's what everybody's listening to
on Earth nowadays.
It's got 300 songs on it.

I think Yondu would want you to have it.

He didn't let us down after all, Captain.
No, he did not, son.

HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...
just remember...
We. Are. Groot.
Hey, fellas.
Wait, where are you going?
You were supposed to be my lift home.
How will I get out of here?
Hey! Aw, gee...
I've got so many more stories to tell.
Aw, guys.
Oh, gee...

Now, I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"
Well, sometimes you have to get captured
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.
See, I spent some time on Earth...
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.
Then I went searching through the Cosmos
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.
Didn't find any.
That's when I came across
a path of death and destruction,
which led me all the way here
into this cage,
where I met you.
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?
Thor, son of Odin.
Surtur, son of a bitch.
You're still alive.
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.
I cannot die.
Not until I fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home.
It's funny you should mention that.
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.
And you, Surtur,
are at the center of all of them.
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.
Hang on.
I'll be back around shortly.
I really feel like
we were connecting there.
Okay, so Ragnarok.
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.
My time has come.
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame,
I shall be restored to my full might.
I will tower over the mountains,
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...
Hang on. Give it a second.
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.
I'm really sorry.
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame
and then you'll suddenly grow as big
as a house?
A mountain!
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
locked away on Asgard?
Odin is not on Asgard.
And your absence has left the throne
defenseless.
Okay, so where is it? This crown?
This is my crown,
the source of my power.
Oh, that's a crown.
I thought it was a big eyebrow.
It's a crown.
Anyway, it sounds like
all I have to do to stop Ragnarok
is rip that thing off your head.
But Ragnarok has already begun.
You cannot stop it.
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.
All will suffer, all will burn.
That's intense.
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.
But it looks like I'm gonna have to
choose option B,
where I bust out of these chains,
knock that tiara off your head,
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.
You cannot stop Ragnarok.
Why fight it?
Because that's what heroes do.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.
And, now!
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.
I make grave mistakes all the time.
Everything seems to work out.
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,
but I could really use a fast exit.
Heimdall?
Heimdall was an idiot.
This job should have made him rich.
Now, the job ain't easy
but it does have its benefits.
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.
Behold...
My stuff.
I'm particularly fond of these.
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard
called Texas.
I even named them. Des and Troy.
You see, when you put them together,
they destroy.
Heimdall, come on.
Stay!
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.
Heimdall?
Skurge?
Is that important?
You girls are in for a treat.
Girls!
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.
Thanks for scaring away my company
and drenching my workplace in brains.
Who are you?
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
We fought together on Vanaheim.
Right. Where is Heimdall?
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.
Traitor?
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall
with negligence of duty
but he disappeared before the trial.
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.
Sure.
Hold on.
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.
What the hell is that?
Oh, brother. This is it.
I take my leave.
You fool, you didn't listen!
I'm sorry.
Lady Sif, get help!
Somebody, help!
Sorry for all I've done.
It's all right. Hold on.
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.
They'd be lucky to have you.
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.
I'm a trickster.
So mischievous.
Sorry about that time I turned you
into a frog.
It was a wonderful joke.
'Twas indeed hilarious.
You are the savior of Asgard.
- Tell my story.
- I will.
Build a statue for me.
We will build a big statue for you.
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.
I will tell Father
what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
And so, Loki died of his wounds,
giving his life for ours.
He fought back those disgusting elves,
he brought peace to the realm.
Loki, my boy...
'Twas many moons ago I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.
On that day,
I did not yet see in you
Asgard's savior. No.
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle
that melted this old fool's heart.
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.
Father.
Shit.
My son, Thor, has returned!
Greetings, my boy.
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.
The people wanted to commemorate him.
Indeed they should.
I like the statue.
A lot better looking than he was
when he was alive, though.
A little less weaselly, less greasy,
maybe.
Do you know what this is?
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster
and destroy the whole planet.
Thank you, dear.
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?
Nope.
I've been having this reoccurring dream
lately.
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.
That's just a silly dream,
signs of an overactive imagination.
Possibly.
But then I decide to go out there
and investigate.
And what do I find,
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,
all while you, Odin,
the protector of those Nine Realms,
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.
Yes, it is best
to respect our neighbors' freedom.
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.
Watching theater.
Board meetings,
and security council meetings...
- You're really gonna make me do it?
- Do what?
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir
as it returns to my hand.
Not even your face.
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.
Then I'll see you on the other side,
brother.
All right, I yield.
Behold!
Thor...
- Odinson.
- No.
You had one job. Just the one.
Where's Odin?
You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Everything was fine without you.
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.
- Ask them.
- Where's Father? Did you kill him?
You had what you wanted.
You had the independence you asked for.
Okay. I know exactly where he is.
I swear I left him right here.
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?
Great planning.
How was I supposed to know?
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.
No? Then why do you dress like one?
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.
I saw you die.
I mourned you, I cried for you.
I'm honored.
Ask him.
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture
with us?
Sure.
Start figuring out where he is.
Oh, my God.
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
She didn't dump me, you know.
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.
What's this? What are you doing?
This isn't me.
Loki.
Thor Odinson.
God of Thunder.
You can put down the umbrella.
So, Earth has wizards now?
The preferred term is
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.
All right, wizard. Who are you?
Why should I care?
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.
Take a seat.
Tea?
I don't drink tea.
What do you drink?
Not tea.
So, I keep a watch list of individuals
and beings from other realms
that may be a threat to this world.
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.
He's a worthy inclusion.
Then why bring him here?
We're looking for my father.
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was,
all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?
Promptly.
Great! Then I'll help you.
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.
And you don't have a phone.
No, I don't have a phone,
but you could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.
So if you could tell me where he is,
I can take him home.
Gladly. He's in Norway.
I'm just seeing whether this incantation
requires any Asgardian modifications.
Nope.
We don't need that.
Will you stop doing that?
I need just one strand of your hair.
Let me explain something.
My hair is not to be meddled with.
We could have just walked.
He's waiting for you.
All right.
Don't forget your umbrella.
Yes.
Sorry.
There we go.
I suppose I'll need my brother back.
Yeah. Right.
I have been falling for 30 minutes!
You can handle him from here.
Yes. Of course.
Thank you very much for your help.
Good luck.
Handle me? Who are you?
Loki.
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...
Bye-bye.
Father?
Look at this place. It's beautiful.
Father, it's us.
My sons.
I've been waiting for you.
I know. We've come to take you home.
Home, yes.
Your mother, she calls me.
Do you hear it?
Loki, lift your magic.
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.
Frigga would have been proud.
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.
I know we failed you.
But we can make this right.
I failed you.
It is upon us. Ragnarok.
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.
No.
It has already begun. She's coming.
My life was all that held her back.
But my time has come.
I cannot keep her away any longer.
Father, who are you talking about?
Goddess of Death. Hela.
My firstborn.
Your sister.
Your what?
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.
Locked her away.
She draws her strength from Asgard,
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.
No, we won't.
I'm on a different path now.
This you must face alone.
I love you, my sons.
Look at that.
Remember this place.
Home.
Brother.
This was your doing.
So he's gone.
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.
You must be Hela.
I'm Thor, son of Odin.
Really? You don't look like him.
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.
You sound like him.
Kneel.
Beg your pardon?
Kneel.
Before your queen.
I don't think so.
It's not possible.
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.
Bring us back!
No!
Loki!
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?
I'm Hela.
I'm just a janitor.
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.
How would you like a job?
Are you a fighter?
Or are you food?
I'm just passing through.
It is food.
On your knees.
He's mine.
Wait!
Wait!
He's mine.
So if you want him, you go through me.
But we've already got him.
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.
More food.
Thank you.
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.
I've got something special.
Hey! Where are you taking me?
Answer me!
Hey!
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.
Many apologies, your majesty.
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard,
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.
My father is dead.
As are the princes.
You're welcome.
We were once the seat
of absolute power in the Cosmos.
Our supremacy was unchallenged.
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.
Our destiny is to rule over all others.
And I am here to restore that power.
Kneel before me
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.
Whoever you are,
whatever you've done, surrender now!
Or we will show you no mercy.
Whoever I am?
Did you listen to a word I said?
This is your last warning!
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Fine.
Charge!
I've missed this.
Still, it's a shame.
Good soldiers dying for nothing,
all because
they couldn't see the future.
Sad.
Look, still alive.
Change of heart?
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.
You evil demoness!
Let's go see my palace.
Fear not, for you are found.
You are home,
and there is no going back.
No one leaves this place.
But what is this place?
The answer is Sakaar.
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.
It is the collection point
for all lost and unloved things.
Like you.
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.
You are valuable.
Here you are loved.
What the hell?
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.
He is the original,
the first lost and the first found.
The creator of Sakaar,
and father of the Contest of Champions.
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.
You are the property of the Grandmaster.
Congratulations!
You will meet the Grandmaster
in five seconds.
Prepare yourself.
Prepare yourself.
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.
He's wonderful.
It is a he?
It is a he.
Yeah.
I love when you come to visit, 142.
You bring me the best stuff.
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
about Scrapper 142,
what do I always say? "She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."
Trash.
No, not trash.
Were you waiting just to call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."
Booze hag.
I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."
'Cause I always say you're the best.
She brought me my beloved champion,
you know.
You say that every time she's here.
What have you brought today? Tell me.
A contender.
A what?
I need to go closer.
I want to get a closer look at this.
Can you take us closer? Thank you.
Pay this lady.
Just wait a damn minute.
I'm not for sale.
Man, he's a fighter.
I take 10 million.
Tell her she's dreaming.
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.
You'll pay for this.
No, I got paid for this.
Here's what I wanna know.
Who are you?
I am the God of Thunder.
I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your
fingers, was that sparkles?
We've located your cousin.
Good!
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.
There he is.
Hey, cuz.
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?
Hi.
So...
Please.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Carlo...
I pardon you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're officially pardoned.
From life.
Help me.
Oh, my God!
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!
The smell.
What does it smell like?
Burnt toast.
What happened to my manners?
I haven't properly introduced myself.
Come on. Follow me.
My name is Grandmaster.
I preside over a little harlequinade
called the Contest of Champions.
People come from far and wide
to unwillingly participate in it.
And you, my friend,
might just be part of the new cast.
What do you say to that?
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games.
I'm going back to Asgard.
Ass-gard.
One, two, three, four.
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.
At that moment, I let go.
Loki?
Loki! Loki!
Over here. Over here.
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!
- What?
- You're alive?
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.
- Get me out of this one. Get me out.
- I can't.
- I can't.
- What?
I've made friends with this man.
He's called the Grandmaster.
- He's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.
The Bifrost brought me out here
weeks ago.
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.
I just got here.
What are you whispering about?
Time works real different
around these parts.
On any other world, I'd be, like,
millions of years old.
But here on Sakaar...
In any case, you know this...
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
God of Thunder.
Tell him.
I've never met this man in my life.
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.
Is he any kind of a fighter?
You take this thing out of my neck
and I'll show you.
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.
If you wanna get back to Ass-place,
Assberg...
Asgard.
Any contender who defeats my champion,
their freedom they shall win.
Fine. Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick!
That's what I call, contender.
Direction would be this way, Lord.
Loki!
Hey. Take it easy, man.
Over here.
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.
I'm kind of like the leader in here.
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.
But don't let that intimidate you.
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke
for you.
This is my very good friend over here,
Miek.
He's an insect and has knives for hands.
You're a Kronan, aren't you?
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.
So hardly anyone turned up, except for
my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.
As punishment, I was forced
to be in here and become a gladiator.
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.
Do you reckon you'd be interested?
How did you...
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here, man.
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?
Doug has.
Doug!
Our luck, Doug's dead.
That's right.
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.
What about you? You're made of rocks.
Perishable rock.
There you go. Another one gone.
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.
Wait. You're not gonna face him,
are you?
Yes, I am.
Gonna fight him, win,
and get the hell out of this place.
That's exactly what Doug used to say.
See you later, new Doug.
Does no one remember me?
Has no one been taught our history?
Look at these lies.
Goblets and garden parties?
Peace treaties?
Odin...
Proud to have it,
ashamed of how he got it.
We were unstoppable.
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.
One by one, the realms became ours.
But then,
simply because my ambition outgrew his,
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.
Before that,
Asgard's warriors were honored,
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.
Most of the stuff in here is fake.
Or weak.
Smaller than I thought it would be.
That's not bad.
But this...
The Eternal Flame.
Want to see what true power
really looks like?
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
I've missed you.
I've missed you all.
Odin,
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,
where the brave shall live forever.
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,
for those that have died
the glorious death.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Being lied to.
Being told you're one thing
and then learning it's all a fiction.
You didn't think
I'd really come and see you, did you?
This place is disgusting.
Does this mean you don't want my help?
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position
with the Grandmaster.
It took me time to win his trust.
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.
What I'm telling you is, you could
join me at the Grandmaster's side.
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?
Our sister destroyed your hammer
like a piece of glass.
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.
You don't stand a chance.
Do you understand
what I'm saying here?
Fine.
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.
Like I've always done.
Would you say something?
Say something!
What would you like me to say?
You faked your own death,
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.
Have I said enough or would you like me
to go back further than the past two days?
You know, I haven't seen this
beloved champion he talks of,
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.
I've placed a large wager against you
tomorrow.
Don't let me down.
Piss off, ghost!
He's freaking gone.
Yuck!
There's still someone's hair and blood
all over this.
Guys, can you clean up the weapons
once you finish your fight?
Disgusting slobs.
Thor,
wanna use a big wooden fork?
No.
Yeah, not really useful.
Unless you're fighting off three vampires
that were huddled together.
I really wish I had my hammer.
Hammer?
Quite unique.
It was made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.
And when I spun it really, really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.
You rode a hammer?
No, I didn't ride the hammer.
The hammer rode you on your back?
No. I used to spin it really fast,
and it would pull me off the...
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?
The ground. It would pull me off the
ground, up into the air, and I would fly.
Every time I threw it,
it would always come back to me.
Sounds like you had a pretty special
and intimate relationship with this hammer
and that losing it was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.
That's a nice way of putting it.
I said they're mine.
See her,
that's the one that put me in here.
Yeah. Scrapper 142.
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.
They are hard to perish.
Asgardian?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.
Asgard is in danger.
My God, you're a Valkyrie.
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger,
until I found out that
you were all women.
There's nothing wrong with women,
of course. I love women.
Sometimes a little too much.
Not in a creepy way,
just more of a respectful appreciation.
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.
It's about time.
Are you done?
Lord of Thunder, you're up.
Please, help me. I need your help.
Bye.
Fine, then you must be a traitor
or a coward.
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect
the throne.
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.
Bring him in for processing.
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.
Now, don't you move.
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair,
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.
Please.
Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.
Please! No!
No!
Look at all of you.
What a show! What a night!
Who's having fun?
Please, I'm your host.
Big round of applause
for all of our undercard competitors,
who today died so gruesomely.
Good sports.
What a show! What a night!
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.
And now, without further ado,
it's main event time.
Making his first appearance,
though he looks quite promising,
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.
I'll say no more, see what you think.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Lord of Thunder.
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.
Okay, this is it.
Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.
He is a creature.
What can we say about him?
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.
I feel a special connection with him.
He's undefeated.
He's the reigning.
He's the defending.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you...
Your Incredible...
Hulk!
Yes!
I have to get off this planet.
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
Hey!
We know each other.
He's a friend from work.
Where have you been?
Everybody thought you were dead.
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer.
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?
He's up there.
Loki! Look who it is!
Banner,
I never thought I would say this,
but I'm happy to see you.
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!
Banner.
Hey, Banner!
No Banner. Only Hulk.
What are you doing?
It's me. It's Thor!
Banner, we're friends.
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!
Here we go.
What?
Hey, big guy.
The sun's getting real low.
That's it.
The sun's going down.
I won't hurt you anymore.
No one will.
Yes!
That's how it feels!
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.
All right. Screw it.
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out!
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!
I told them we were friends!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Another day, another Doug.
What is that noise?
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.
There's a resistance trying to knock down
the front gates.
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.
What I meant was,
what's your ambition?
I just want a chance to prove myself.
Recognition.
When I was young,
every great king had an executioner.
Not just to execute people,
but also to execute their vision.
But mainly to execute people.
Still, it was a great honor.
I was Odin's executioner.
And you shall be my executioner.
Let's begin our conquest.
Skurge, where's the sword?
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.
Those people you mentioned,
the ones who aren't falling into line...
Round them up.
Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
These bloody things are everywhere.
Come on.
You'll be safe here.
Are we cool?
It's Hulk in a hot tub.
So how long
have you been like that?
Like what?
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.
Hulk always Hulk.
How'd you get here?
Winning.
You mean cheating?
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?
How'd you arrive here?
Quinjet.
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?
That's naked.
He's very naked.
It's in my brain now.
Quinjet.
Yes!
I'm getting us out of here.
This terrible, awful place.
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.
Hulk stay.
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.
We must prevent Ragnarok.
Ragnarok?
The prophesied death of my home world.
The end of days, it's the end of...
If you help me get back to Asgard,
I can help you get back to Earth.
Earth hate Hulk.
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.
You're one of the Avengers.
One of the team, one of our friends.
This is what friends do.
They support each other.
You're Banner's friend.
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.
Banner's friend.
I don't even like Banner.
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."
Thor go. Hulk stay.
Fine.
Stay here.
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.
Smash you.
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Baby arms.
- What?
Baby.
Moron! You big child.
Thor go!
I am going.
Thor go again.
Thor home.
Hulk trains.
That's great. Have fun.
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.
What have you been up to?
Winning.
Heimdall, I know you can see me.
I need you to help me.
Help me see.
I see you, but you're far away.
What's going on here?
Come see for yourself.
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold
built by our ancestors.
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?
We won't last long if we stay.
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.
Come on.
Hela is ravenous.
If I let her leave, she'll consume
Nine Realms and all the Cosmos.
We need you.
I'm working on it. But I don't even know
where the hell I am.
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.
- Which one?
- The big one.
Thor sad.
Shut up.
Thor sad.
I'm not sad, you idiot.
I'm pissed off!
Angry. I lost my father.
I lost my hammer.
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
- You're not even listening.
Don't kick stuff.
You're being a really bad friend.
You bad friend!
- You know what we call you?
- No.
We call you the stupid Avenger.
You're tiny Avenger!
What, are you crazy?
Yes.
You know what? Earth does hate you.
No.
I'm sorry I said those things.
You're not the stupid Avenger.
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.
It's okay.
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.
Hulk always, always angry.
I know.
We're the same, you and I.
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.
Yeah, same.
Hulk like fire, Thor like water.
We're kind of both like fire.
But Hulk like real fire.
Hulk like raging fire.
Thor like smoldering fire.
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.
Angry girl.
What's going on? What are you...
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone?
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.
I need her to stay.
Stay?
Block.
Stay.
- Please.
- Please.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I'll listen to you
till this is empty.
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.
We need to get back there.
I need your help.
Finished. Bye.
Odin is dead.
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.
I'm going to stop her.
- Alone?
- Nope.
I'm putting together a team.
It's me, you, and the big guy.
No. No team. Only Hulk.
It's me and you.
I think it's only you.
Please, listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.
I'm not getting dragged into
another one of Odin's family squabbles.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace
and tried to seize the throne.
When she tried
to escape her banishment
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.
I only survived because...
Look, I already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne,
and it cost me everything.
That's what's wrong with Asgard.
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.
I agree.
Don't get familiar.
I agree.
That's why I turned down the throne.
But this isn't about the crown.
This is about the people.
They're dying
and they're your people, too.
Forget it.
I have.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Good. Great.
- Great.
Thank you.
- For what?
- For this.
Didn't see that, did you?
There... That's better.
You know, go ahead.
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.
Keep drinking, keep hiding.
But me...
I choose to run toward my problems
and not away from them.
Because that's what...
Because that's what heroes do.
Friend stay!
Yes!
All right.
Come on.
Welcome. Voice activation required.
Thor.
Access denied.
Thor, son of Odin.
Access denied.
God of Thunder.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Damn you, Stark.
Point Break.
Welcome, Point Break.
Friend stay!
No, no, no!
Stop!
Stay!
Hulk, stop breaking everything!
Don't go!
Nice work, big guy.
We don't know where Ultron's headed,
but you're going very high, very fast.
So, I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode,
so I need you to help me out. Okay?
I need you to...
No! No, Banner!
Oh, jeez.
Banner.
Hey, hey, hey.
You all right, Banner?
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.
That's it, breathe.
I won't hurt you.
Sun's going down.
- Thor.
- Yeah.
What happened to your hair?
Some creepy old man cut it off.
- It looks good.
- Thanks.
Where are we? How's Nat?
- Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?
- Banner, listen.
- What?
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.
What are you saying?
What?
I've been Hulk for two years?
I'm afraid so.
What the hell happened?
Banner, there's something
you should know.
Voice activation required.
Banner.
Welcome, strongest Avenger.
What?
Ship's log.
Thor, where are we?
Yeah, about that.
Sakaar, hear ye.
Attention please. I have some bad news.
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.
Who's that?
He kind of runs the place.
You actually lived at his house
for awhile.
- I did?
- Yeah.
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.
Doesn't sound right.
Well, it's true.
It seems that that criminally seductive
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.
Oh, no.
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.
No, no, no.
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.
These are Tony's clothes.
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?
No, he's not here.
But listen. Just stay calm, okay?
The sun's going down. The sun's getting
really low. Sun's going down.
I'm upset!
I'm very upset.
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.
And you know who I'm blaming?
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!
Don't interrupt me!
Here you go.
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?
He was interrupting.
That's not a capital violation.
Where was I?
My precious champion
has come up missing,
and it's all because of that
Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.
Your brother.
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated, or you know.
I'm sure there's a big history.
And your contender...
My dear friend,
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could
bring them both back to you. Alive.
I could do it in two.
I could do it in one.
Let's stop there.
You know what? I woke up this morning
thinking about a public execution.
But for now,
I'll settle for this sweet little
"Who's gonna get him first?"
So, you're on the clock.
What have you done?
I don't answer to you, lackey.
It's Loki.
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.
Why would you help my brother escape
with that green fool?
I don't help anyone.
You're a Valkyrie.
I thought the Valkyrie had all died
gruesome deaths.
Choose your next words wisely.
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low.
Oh, shoot.
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?
I just need you to stay calm.
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.
Yeah. One.
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.
It's a new experience.
My neurons, they're firing faster
than my brain can handle the information.
The whole thing
is totally different this time.
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.
No, it's not what matters.
What I'm trying to tell you, is that
if I turn into the Hulk again,
Banner may never come back.
And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.
Thank you.
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.
What?
Listen, my people are in great danger.
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,
who also happens to be my sister.
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...
I don't wanna fight your sister.
That's a family issue.
No, she's an evil being.
I don't care what she is.
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.
- What?
- I just told you.
If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.
And you don't care.
No, no. I'm putting together the team.
The Hulk is the fire.
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.
- What? No!
- It's gross.
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.
No! I don't even like the Hulk.
He's all like...
"Smash, smash, smash."
I prefer you.
Thanks.
But if I'm being honest,
when it comes to fighting evil beings,
he is very powerful and useful.
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
Is he though?
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.
What are you doing with that?
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?
Because you were naked.
Okay, I'll give you that.
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!
Tony wears his pants super tight.
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.
Maybe the fact that I was trapped
for two years
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.
Hey. It's okay.
You're good. Calm down. Come on.
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard
and you're not gonna have to think about
the Hulk ever again. All right?
All right.
This is bad.
Banner! Banner!
Banner!
Banner!
Thor!
Hi.
Hi.
I was gonna do that.
Yeah, well, I did it first.
That's good. What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.
I got sidetracked.
What's with the...
It's my disguise.
But I can see your face.
Not when I do this, you can't.
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did
with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?
What are those things on her eyes?
Are those people that she's killed?
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.
Who is this guy?
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too.
Look, I've spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.
Sakaar seemed like the best place
to drink and forget, and to die one day.
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.
I don't plan to stop drinking.
But I don't wanna forget.
I can't turn away anymore,
so if I'm gonna die,
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.
- Good.
- Yeah.
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.
Has it got a name?
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.
Revengers?
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.
Do you want revenge?
I'm undecided.
Okay.
Also, I've got a peace offering.
Surprise.
Just had to be sure.
Hello, Bruce.
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.
Where are you at these days?
It varies from moment to moment.
Is that a Dragonfang?
It is.
My God.
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
apart as any two known systems.
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.
Nope. We are going through the big one.
The Devil's Anus?
Anus?
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
We need another ship.
That will tear mine to pieces.
She's right. We need one that can
withstand the geodetic strain
from the singularity.
And has an offline
power steering system
that could also function
without the on board computer.
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.
What do you say?
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.
Talk about an adventure.
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.
There are one or two ships.
Absolute top of the line models...
I don't mean to impose...
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.
I may even have stolen the access codes
to his security system.
And suddenly you're overcome
with an urge to do the right thing.
Heavens, no.
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster,
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.
You're telling us that you can get us
access into the garage
without setting off any alarms?
Yes, brother. I can.
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.
He did try to kill me.
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.
There was one time
when we were children,
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.
So, I went to pick up the snake
to admire it,
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.
If we're boosting a ship
we're gonna need to draw some guards
away from the palace.
Why not set the beast loose?
Shut up.
You guys have a beast?
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.
We're going to start a revolution.
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.
Is that some sort of protoplasm,
all the stuff that's coming out of you,
or are they eggs?
Looks like eggs.
I'm looking for Korg.
Who's asking?
I know you're asking.
Is there anyone else asking,
or is it just you?
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.
The revolution has begun.
Revolution? How did this happen?
Don't know.
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated
and the slaves have armed themselves.
I don't like that word.
Which? Mainframe?
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?
No, the "S" word.
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.
Okay, that's better.
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.
I disagree.
Open communication
was never our family's forte.
You have no idea.
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.
Hello.
Hi.
Odin brought us together.
It's almost poetic that his death
should split us apart.
We might as well be strangers now.
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.
Here's the thing.
I'm probably better off staying here
on Sakaar.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Did you just agree with me?
Come on, this place is perfect for you.
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...
Brother, you're gonna do great here.
Do you truly think so little of me?
Loki, I thought the world of you.
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.
I don't know,
maybe there's still good in you.
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.
Yeah.
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.
It's what you always wanted.
Hey, let's do "Get Help."
- What?
- "Get Help."
No.
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.
- It's great. It works every time.
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.
We're doing it.
We are not doing "Get Help."
Get help! Please!
My brother, he's dying.
Get help! Help him!
Classic.
Still hate it.
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?
The Commodore.
Right.
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.
Loki.
I know I've betrayed you many times
before,
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.
Never one for sentiment, were you?
Easier to let it burn.
I agree.
That looks painful.
Dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.
I trust you, you betray me.
Round and round in circles we go.
See, Loki, life is about...
It's about growth.
It's about change.
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief,
but you could be more.
I'll just put this over here for you.
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.
All right, I can figure this out.
It's just another spaceship.
Loyal Sakaarians,
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship
and my favorite champion.
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.
Do not let him leave this planet.
- Good shot!
- Thanks.
Open the doors.
Okay.
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.
Why?
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?
Yes, we should.
Where are the guns on this ship?
There aren't any.
- It's a leisure vessel.
- What?
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,
orgies and stuff.
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?
Yeah.
Don't touch anything.
No!
- No!
- No!
Get inside!
In a minute.
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!
Okay, come on.
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.
That looks like a gun.
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
Yeah!
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!
There she is.
Our ticket out of here.
Hey, what's this?
Thank you.
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.
You wanna come?
You do seem like you're
in desperate need of leadership.
Why, thank you.
Here we go.
Shit.
Asgardians...
Some misguided soul
has stolen the Bifrost sword.
Tell us where it is
or there will be consequences.
Bad ones.
Well?
You.
Well? Executioner?
Wait!
Wait!
I know where the sword is.
I never thought I'd be back here.
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.
I mean, not that it's not nice.
It's just, it's on fire.
Here, up here in the mountains.
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.
She's coming for them.
Okay, drop me off at the palace
and I'll draw her away.
And get yourself killed?
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you
two to help get everyone off Asgard.
How the hell are we supposed to do that?
I have a man on the ground.
Asgard.
She's here.
Now the ship has a gun.
I'll take it from here.
I found this in the armory.
Good luck.
Your Majesty...
Don't die.
You know what I mean.
We must keep moving!
Go to the Bifrost!
Sister.
You're still alive.
I love what you've done with the place.
Redecorating, I see.
It seems our father's solution
to every problem was to cover it up.
Or to cast it out.
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.
You see?
You never knew him.
Not at his best.
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations
in blood and tears.
Where do you think all this gold
came from?
And then, one day,
he decided to become a benevolent king.
To foster peace, to protect life.
To have you.
I understand why you're angry.
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.
But it can't be you.
You're just the worst.
Okay, get up.
You're in my seat.
You know, Father once told me
that a wise king never seeks out war.
But must always be ready for it.
Go back!
Go!
To be honest, I expected more.
Heimdall!
The sword!
Here's the difference between us.
I'm Odin's firstborn,
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.
And you're nothing.
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.
Now you remind me of Dad.
The stupid dog won't die!
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.
You wanted to know who I am?
What the hell are you talking about?
You'll see!
You see? No one's going anywhere.
I'll get that sword,
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.
Hey, man.
I'm Korg. This is Miek.
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?
Your savior is here.
Did you miss me?
Everyone, on that ship now.
Welcome home. I saw you coming.
Of course you did.
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.
You see...
I'm not a queen or a monster.
I'm the Goddess of Death.
What were you the god of, again?
Even when you had two eyes,
you'd see only half the picture.
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.
It was never your source of strength.
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.
Asgard is not a place. Never was.
This could be Asgard.
Asgard is where our people stand.
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.
I'm not as strong as you.
No...
You're stronger.
Tell me, brother.
What were you the god of, again?
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.
This isn't over.
I think we should disband the Revengers.
Hit her with a lightning blast.
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.
It did nothing.
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.
It won't end there.
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.
She'll hunt us down.
We need to stop her here and now.
So what do we do?
I'm not doing "Get Help."
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.
Loki,
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.
This was about causing Ragnarok.
Surtur's crown, the vault.
It's the only way.
Bold move, brother.
Even for me.
Shall we?
After you.
This is madness.
Go! Go, now!
For Asgard.
Hela!
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
Hela, enough!
You want Asgard, it's yours.
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.
You can't defeat me.
No, I know.
But he can.
No.
Tremble before me, Asgard!
I am your reckoning!
The people are safe.
That's all that matters.
We're fulfilling the prophecy.
I hate this prophecy.
So do I, but we have no choice.
Surtur destroys Asgard,
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.
But we need to let him finish the job,
otherwise...
No!
Hulk, stop, you moron!
Hulk, stop.
Just for once in your life, don't smash.
Big monster!
Let's go!
Fine.
I am Asgard's doom!
The damage is not too bad.
As long as the foundations
are still strong,
we can rebuild this place.
It will become a haven
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.
What have I done?
You saved us from extinction.
Asgard is not a place...
It's a people.
It suits you.
Maybe you're not so bad after all,
brother.
Maybe not.
Thank you.
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.
I'm here.
Your throne.
So, King of Asgard.
Where to?
I'm not sure.
Any suggestions?
Miek, where are you from?
Miek's dead.
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him
on the bridge.
I've just felt so guilty,
I've been carrying him around all day.
Miek, you're alive!
He's alive, guys.
What was your question again, bro?
Earth it is.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to go back to Earth?
Yes, of course. The people of Earth
love me. I'm very popular.
Let me rephrase that.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to bring me back to Earth?
Probably not, to be honest.
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like
everything's gonna work out fine.
Oh, boy.
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.
Come on. No?
Me too.
'Cause I've been a big part of it.
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.
So, you're welcome.
And it's a tie.

Things are never gonna be
the same now.
I mean, look at this.
You got aliens.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.
Yeah. Tell you what, though.
It ain't bad, is it?
No. Yeah.
Kid's got a future.
Yeah, well...
...we'll see, I guess.
No, hey!
You can't saw through that stuff.
These alien bastards are tough.
You gotta use the stuff they use.
- See? All right.
- All right.
Oh, hey!
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.
Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.
This is a huge deal for us.
Attention, please!
In accordance
with Executive Order 396B...
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
Qualified personnel.
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so-
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under ou rjurisdiction.
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected...
...or you will be prosecuted.
Ma'am, what am-- ?
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.
Look...
...I bought trucks for this job.
I brought in a whole new crew.
These guys have a family.
I have a family.
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.
What'd you say?
Yeah.
He's right. I overextended myself.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.
Put them down.
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?
A joint venture between Stark Industries
and the government...
...the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection...
...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.
Yeah, it's all rigged.
Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material...
...scattered throughout the tri-state area.
Hey, chief!
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?
I ain't hauling it.
It's too bad.
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.
I tell you what.
Let's keep it.
The world's changing.
It's time we change, too.
There you go, Mason.
Business is good.
New York. Queens.
- t's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.
- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.
Then why are you narrating
in that voice?
- Because it's fun.
- Fun.
So why do they call you Happy?
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.
Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?
There's a bathroom on it.
No pilot? That's awesome.
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.
This is your first time
on a private plane?
My first time on any plane.
Should it-- ? Should it be-- ?
Should it be making that noise?
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.
Something about
Captain America going crazy.
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?
We're not roommates. Suit up.
Okay, Peter, you got this.
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.
- Where's the case?
- What case?
What? I thought that was a closet.
- This is still my room?
- Go.
- My room is way bigger than--
- There.
I found the case. I found the case.
"A minor upgrade"?
Oh, my God.
- Put it on.
- What the-- ?
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen--
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.
This is insane. Insane.
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.
Hey, everyone.
The craziest thing just happened.
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him--
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"
And then-- Hey, just a second!
coming!
L- ley-
We have thin walls here.
What are you doing, a little video diary?
- Yeah.
- It's all right.
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.
Hey. You know what?
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.
Three, two, one. Hey, May.
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...
...this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.
Everyone was impressed.
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.
That was a private conversation.
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.
- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line.
- Can you give us a moment?
- Want me to leave?
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.
I can keep the suit?
Yes, we were just talking about it.
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.
I've seen his cardiogram.
- All right?
- Yes.
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.
- This it?
- Seventh floor.
- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?
- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.
So when's our next-- ?
When's our next "retreat," you know?
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?
No, I mean, we'll call you.
Like, someone will call you. All right?
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.
Bye.
They're gonna call me.
What's up, Penis Parker?
Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.
Don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.
Do you have a date for homecoming?
Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Damn it. You, in my office right now.
Join me, and together...
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.
- What?
- So lame.
That's awesome. How many pieces?
Three thousand eight hundred and three.
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark--
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.
Always got that internship.
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.
Here's a gold coin."
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.
That'd be great.
I'm gonna be late.
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...
...between points A and B?
Flash.
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.
Nope. Peter. You still with us?
Yeah, yeah.
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.
You're dead.
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...
...but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing...
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.
Did Liz get a new top?
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.
Too late.
You guys are losers.
Well, then why do you sit with us?
Because I don't have any friends.
Next question.
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?
Hydrogen's the lightest.
That's not the question. Okay.
- Yeah.
- Uranium.
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.
Peter, it's nationals.
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.
Wait. What's happening?
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.
- No, no, no.
- Why not?
Really? Right before nationals?
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.
Flash, you're in for Peter.
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.
I got a hot date
with Black Widow coming up.
That is false.
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Delmar?
Hey, Mr. Parker.
Number five, right?
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.
You got it, boss.
How's your aunt?
Yeah, she's all right.
She's a very hot Italian woman.
How's your daughter?
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.
Here's 5 dollars.
What's up, Murph?
How you doing, buddy?
So how's school?
It's boring. Got better things to do.
Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.
Finally.
- What's the matter with you?
- Could you hold this?
Thanks.
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?
Everybody good?
Hey!
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?
Call me Spider-Man.
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.
- Yeah!
- Not bad.
Hey, buddy.
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumb-ass!
Hey! Shut that off!
- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was--
- I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!
- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know?
- He was putting that in the window!
- Every day with these alarms!
- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there, punk.
Hey, Gary. How you doing?
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?
I'm good, I'm good.
You have reached
the voice-mail box of:
Happy Hogan.
Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.
I just feel like I could be doing more.
You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.
So, yeah, just call me back.
It's Peter. Parker.
Why would I tell him about the churro?
Hey, hey-
Okay.
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.
Oh, nice.
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?
You're the Avengers.
What are you guys doing here?
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.
Hey"
Oh, this feels so weird.
What is that thing?
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.
911. What's your emergency?
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.
Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?
No. Wait, wait, wait!
Mr. Delmar.
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
ls anybody in here? Hello?
Oh, come on.
I gotta--
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.
Okay. Good. Yes.
Yes-- No. No, put that down.
That's worth more
than you or me. Yeah?
The craziest thing just happened.
These guys were robbing an ATM...
- ...with high-tech weapons--
- Take a breath. I don't have time...
- ...for ATM robberies...
- Yeah, but--
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.
Everything's gotta be out next week.
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?
Tony sold Avengers Tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate...
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?
What about you?
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?
- Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?
- Stay away from anything dangerous.
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?
I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap.
- My backpack's gone.
- That doesn't sound responsible.
- I'll call you back.
- Feel free not to.
What was that?
It's nothing. Nothing.
You're the Spider-Man.
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.
You can't just bust into my room!
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.
A thing to do after.
Okay.
Maybe put on some clothes.
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.
Mr. Stark knows
because he made my suit. That's it.
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?
Yeah, basically.
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.
Come on, Ned, please.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I-- Please.
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?
I swear.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
I can't believe this is happening now.
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.
Okay, well, wait, then.
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?
This is the Stark internship.
Just get out of here.
What's the matter?
Thought you loved larb.
It's too larby?
Not larby enough.
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?
You know I larb you.
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.
A lot of work.
The Stark internship.
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.
- Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...
- What does he have you doing?
- ...in an explosion...
- You need to use your instincts.
...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...
What?
...the Spider-Man.
As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...
...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.
Miraculously, no one was harmed.
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Six blocks away from us.
I need a new backpack.
- What?
- I need a new backpack.
That's five.
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.
It's on the house.
Thanks.
That's nice of him.
I think he larbs you.
You got bit by a spider?
Can it bite me?
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.
Maybe. How much did it hurt?
The spider's dead, Ned.
You were here?
Yeah.
You could've died.
Do you lay eggs?
What? No.
- Can you spit venom?
- No.
Can you summon an army of spiders?
No, Ned.
The Sokovia Accords were put
into place...
How far can you shoot your webs?
It's unknown. Shut up.
-- To begin regulating...
If I was you,
I would stand on a building...
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could--
- Shut up, Ned.
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.
...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.
- I stole his shield.
- What?
Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher...
...will conduct
the Captain America Fitness Challenge.
Thank you, Captain.
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.
It's required by the state. Let's do it.
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?
What does Hulk smell like?
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?
Ned, just...okay?
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset...
...telling the other guy where t0 go?
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- I don't need a guy in the chair.
Looking good, Parker.
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.
Well, what about the Spider-Man?
It's just Spider-Man.
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.
Oh, my God,
she's crushing on Spider-Man.
No way.
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.
Like, what if he's seriously burned?
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.
Peter knows Spider-Man.
No, I don't. No. I-- I mean--
They're friends.
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.
But it's...
...through the Stark internship.
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.
It's okay.
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?
What are you doing?
Helping you out.
Did you not hear her?
Liz has a crush on you.
Dude, you're an Avenger.
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.
House party in the suburbs.
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.
It'll be a night to remember.
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.
Yeah, it gives me confidence.
This is a mistake.
Hey, let's just go home.
Oh, Peter.
I know. I know it's really hard...
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.
It's flowering now.
He's so stressed out lately.
What helps with stress is a party.
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.
Peter.
- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.
Bye, May.
Dude, you have the suit, right?
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.
L- ley-
DJ Flash.
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in...
...say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.
Can't believe you're at this lame party.
But you're here too.
Am w.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.
I'm so happy you guys came.
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
- What a great party.
- Thanks.
Oh, I--
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta--
- Yeah.
- Have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Dude, what are you doing?
She's here. Spider it up.
No, no, no. I can't-- I cannot do this.
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.
Peter, no one wants that.
Dude.
Penis Parker, what's up?
So where's your pal Spider-Man?
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?
He must be around..."
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?
What the hell?
This sucks.
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.
Here. You try.
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.
I got antigrav climbers.
Yo, climbers?
Okay, what the hell is that?
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.
All right.
What was that?
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.
Did you just do it again?
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.
Toomes's phone.
Boss.
Oh, my butt!
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.
Hey, hey, buddy.
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.
Now, this is more like it.
Smells really good.
Great movie!
Oh, hey, guys.
NO! No!
Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.
Peter, where are you?
The hat's not working. This is not cool.
Almost got you.
Thought you got away from me,
didn't you?
I got you right where I want you.
Surprise!
What the hell?
Oh, hey.
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?
I put everything in your suit.
Including this heater.
That's better. Thanks.
What were you thinking?
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.
Take him down now, huh?
Crockett, there are people
who handle this son of thing.
- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.
Mr. Stark, you didn't have
to come out here.
I had that. I was fine.
Oh, I'm not here.
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...
...or you would be toast right now.
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.
Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.
- Why?
- Why?
Because I said so!
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.
Stay close to the ground.
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.
Can't you just be a friendly...
...neighborhood Spider-Man?
But I'm ready for more than that now.
No, you're not.
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.
Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.
Are you driving?
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.
I got some pull at MIT. End call.
No, I don't need to go to--
Mr. Stark is no longer connected.
That's awesome.
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."
- Penis!
- Parker!
- Penis!
- Parker!
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
Idiots.
Idiots.
Idiots!
Boss?
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?
Sorry. You left it out.
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?
You're still on that? I told you, no.
The answer's no. Forget it.
I mean, that was badass.
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.
Under the radar!
That's how we survive.
If you bring Damage Control
or the Avengers down here, we're through.
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars...
...calling yourself the Shocker.
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?
Whatever, old man. Come on.
Look.
Look.
I know you don't give a crap
about anything.
But I do.
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I can't afford your bullshit.
- Get out of here.
- What?
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.
All right.
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?
With everything I know.
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying...
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.
- You know what?
- What?
You're right.
- That work?
- I don't know.
I can't afford that.
Wait.
Damn.
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?
No, that's that one.
Here.
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.
All right.
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.
Yeah, well, something came up.
What is that?
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Awesome.
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.
So scary.
Well, look, I think it's...
...a power source.
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.
That's an inductive charging plate. That's
what I use to charge my toothbrush.
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey...
...into this amazing--
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.
We'll go to the lab after class
and run tests.
Let's do it.
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.
We gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy."
You're right.
Crap.
Come on, come on, come on.
High schools creep me out.
They got this funny smell, you know?
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.
What?
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.
- Peter--
- No. Stay there, Ned.
Peter.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Yeah. You good?
Chess.
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.
There's no sign of the weapon.
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.
This is so awesome.
I know, right?
They're in Brooklyn.
Staten Island.
Leaving Jersey.
They stopped.
Maryland?
- What's there?
- I don't know.
Evil lair?
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.
Badass.
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?
It's not too far from D.C.
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.
No, no way. You can't quit on us...
...stroll up and be welcomed back
by everyone.
Hey, welcome back!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.
- What?
- He's taking your place.
Excuse me, can we go already?
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.
Focus up.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.
The second law of thermodynamics.
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.
Liz, don't overwork them.
Strontium, barium, vibranium.
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.
Glad to be back.
- What is the current standard unit of-- ?
- Can I take this real quick?
Yeah, fine.
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker.
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...
...is a complete violation of privacy.
- That's different.
- What's different?
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.
- It's no big deal.
- Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.
You kidding me? This place is huge.
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?
Peter...
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?
I gotta follow these guys to their boss
before they move again...
...and I don't really want Mr. Stark
to know about it.
So you're lying to Iron Man now?
No, I'm not lying.
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.
Gotcha.
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here...
...but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.
What?
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.
- t's not cool.
- But you are a kid.
A kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.
I mean, what if this is illegal?
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.
I can handle it. Ned, come on.
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.
- Don't do that.
- Come on.
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.
- They're moving.
- Be careful.
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.
We're gonna go swimming.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.
L- ley-
I was-- I was gonna go study
in the business center.
You don't need to.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.
And besides...
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so--
I-- I heard it in a TED Talk.
And I read a coaching book.
You really--
This is really important to you.
Yeah. It's our future.
I'm not gonna screw it up.
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
Let's go.
- Good evening, Peter.
- Hello? Hello?
Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...
...and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.
Thank you.
Where would you like
to take me tonight?
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.
Tracker located.
Plotting course to intercept target.
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.
One hundred meters
from destination and closing.
Jump now.
Detecting three individuals.
Why is their secret lair
in a gas station? That's so lame.
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?
Do you want to hear
what they're saying?
I can hear what they're saying? Yeah.
Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design.
Whoa, that's so cool.
Can't believe they're still cleaning up
that Triskelion mess.
I love it. They keep making messes...
- ...we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.
They're in the middle of a heist.
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.
Okay, I'll get closer
to see what's happening.
Would you like me
to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?
"Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.
Activating instant Kill.
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.
Deactivating Instant Kill.
Did you hear that?
What the hell just happened?
What was that?
You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.
What's wrong with my web-shooters?
Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
- Would you like to see more options?
You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.
Mr. Stark really overdid it.
You two wait right here.
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?
- That one.
- Great choice.
Would you like me to set this
as your new default?
No, no, no.
- Push that in. No, the other--
- Here? This one here?
- What was that?
- Taser webs.
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.
You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.
Would you like to run
a refresher course?
- No. Just-- You choose.
- Sure thing.
Six-alpha-niner,
are you running on time?
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.
Oh, that's him.
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.
Pulling in behind the caboose.
Deploy anchors.
Dropping down.
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.
All right, coming up.
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.
Oh, God.
- Suit lady, what was that?!
- You told me to choose.
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.
Activating all systems.
My head.
You appear to have a mild concussion.
Hey, so where am I right now?
I'm not sure.
The container walls are hindering
my sensors.
Wait a minute.
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have
to fight our way out of this one.
Three, two, one.
What is this place?
Suit lady, where am I?
You're in the most secure facility
on the eastern seaboard.
The Damage Control deep storage vault.
No. Seriously?
The door will most likely remain closed
until morning.
Morning?
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?
I think I should probably give you a name.
Like Liz. No, no, no.
God, that's-- That's weird.
What about Karen?
You can call me Karen
if you would like.
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?
What?
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.
- Ricochet web.
- Ricochet web.
- Cool.
- Splitter web.
- Web grenade.
- Web grenade!
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?
Who is Liz?
Who's Liz? She's--
She's the best. She's awesome.
She's just a girl who goes to my school.
And--
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."
What's weird about that?
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.
Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.
Thanks, Karen.
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.
Hey, how long we been here anyways?
- Thirty-seven minutes-
- What?!
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.
I cannot take this anymore.
I got t0-- I gotta get out of here.
There's got t0 be something in here
I can use.
Okay, let's see.
Nope.
That's awesome.
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.
That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?
t would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.
No, no, no.
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.
Trial unsuccessful.
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.
Okay. Hold on, hold on.
Initiating trial 247.
It worked. It works.
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.
Thank you.
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.
Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.
- It's Ned. Leave a message.
- Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!
There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.
We have now entered sudden death.
The next correct answer wins
the championship.
Midtown Tech?
Zero.
That is correct.
Midtown takes the championship.
- We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just--
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by--
Okay.
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?
- t's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.
- Listen.
- We're at the Washington Monument.
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.
- Is that Liz?
- Put Ned back on the phone.
- You should tell her how you feel.
- You flake. You are lucky we won.
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.
- All items on the belt, please.
- There's something in Ned's backpack.
It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through x-ray.
Liz? Liz! Damn it.
Can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?
The Chitauri core has detonated...
...and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.
Just stay calm, everyone.
Oh, we are all going to die here.
Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.
We're freaking screwed.
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.
The safety systems
are completely failing.
We're very safe in here.
The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.
Going as fast as I can!
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.
You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.
What?! Why?
Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.
- How do I get in there?
- Activating reconnaissance drone.
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.
Locating optimal entry point.
Proceed to southwest window.
Karen, I'm on my way.
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Okay. Oh, my God.
Okay.
What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.
- Why are you hesitating?
- It's fine.
I've just never been this high before.
You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...
...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.
Perfect.
Oh, my God.
Why is it not breaking?
It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.
My friends are in there! Stop!
Return to the ground immediately.
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.
Stand down!
Return to the ground immediately.
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!
Go up, 90 UP-
I got this.
Take my trophy.
This is your last chance.
I'm gonna die.
Break!
I did it.
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Let's go, let's go!
Okay, Okay-
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.
- This is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.
Liz!
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay.
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.
- Come on in.
- You guys good?
So is everyone okay?
This is your chance, Peter.
Kiss her.
Thank you.
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck...
Yeah, damn it.
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?
Yeah, but then that's it.
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.
No.
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those...
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.
Really?
I'm gonna kill him.
- I'm gonna find him--
- Found him.
The Spider-Man swooped in...
...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.
The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.
Peter. Come here,
come here, come here.
This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...
...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.
Later that day,
they also defeated death.
Explosion. Salty scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.
There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.
As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.
I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.
Not again.
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.
How can you show your spider spirit?
Dude, dude, dude.
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.
Dude, listen, I figured it out.
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.
Ned, I'm probably never gonna
come back here.
Mr. Stark is moving
the Avengers upstate...
- ...so when I bring this guy in--
- Dude.
You want to be a high school dropout?
I am so far beyond high school right now.
Parker, my office.
So...
...you got detention.
You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.
The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?
Maybe you were trying to be cool.
But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...
...the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.
We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.
Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...
- ...you know is wrong...
- Where you going? Get back here.
...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.
It's you.
So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.
May?
Hey, Karen. What's up?
Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?
I was wondering if you could help me.
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.
I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.
- Footage?
- Yes, Peter.
I record everything you see.
- Everything?
- Everything.
- All the time?
- It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.
Yeah, of course it is.
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
- With pleasure.
Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.
Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.
Go later in the day, later in the day.
It is I, Thor, son of Odin.
No, no, no. That's definitely--
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.
- Your impressions are very funny.
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.
Okay.
- The two on the right, who are they?
- Searching law enforcement databases.
No records found
for two of the individuals.
Nothing'?
- One individual identified.
Aaron Davis, age 33.
He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.
Let's pay him a visit.
Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?
Yeah.
- Remember me?
- Hey--
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.
- All right, chill.
- Come on!
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man.
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl--
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?
I need to know. Give me names or else.
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.
Look, man.
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.
They can't be out on the streets.
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half--
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- It's too much bread.
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.
The other night, you told that dude,
"if you shoot somebody, shoot me."
That's pretty ballsy.
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.
I got a nephew who live here.
Who are these guys?
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.
I don't know who he is
or where he is.
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with...
...he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.
Yes! Yes.
- Thank--
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just--
Yeah.
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?
You got to get better
at this part of the job.
I don't understand.
I'm intimidating.
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.
No, no, no. Come fix this.
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.
Nice.
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
Sure thing.
He's up front, main deck.
I hate this guy.
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?
Just keep me posted.
There's no record of him
in my criminal database.
Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.
- Who's the guy on the left?
- Mac Gargan.
Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.
Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.
White pickup truck.
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.
Oh, this is too perfect.
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.
- Incoming call from Tony Stark.
- No, no, no.
Don't answer.
- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
- I'm actually at school.
- No, you're not.
- Nice work in D. C.
- Okay.
My dad never really gave me
a lot of support...
...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.
I'm in the middle of something.
Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.
Anyway, great things are about to-
What is that?
I'm at band practice.
That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?
- I gotta go. End call.
- Hey.
I'll take those!
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry
was at 10:30. You missed it.
Spider guy's here.
Not so fast.
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.
I got to say, the other guy was way better
with that thing.
I'm honestly--
I'm-- I'm shocked.
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.
What do you mean, FBI?
- The Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- I know, but what are they doing here?
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!
No.
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.
We're getting out of here.
Activate Taser web!
You're messing with things
you don't understand.
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.
Web grenade. Web grenade.
Splitter web, go.
Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!
No, no, no.
What the hell?
What the hell?
Hi, Spider-Man.
Band practice, was it?
Yeah, Iron Man!
Mr. Stark.
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?
I think you've done enough.
So that's it. You're just gonna run?
Feds were waiting for us.
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?
Yeah, I'm running.
You should too.
You know I can't do that.
So now what?
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?
Seriously?
Yes. You will not regret this.
You in?
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch...
.../ tell you to stay away from this.
Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...
...so you could sneak around
behind my back...
...doing the one thing
I told you not to do.
ls everyone okay?
No thanks to you.
No thanks to me?
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...
...but you didn't listen.
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.
And if you died...
...I feel like that's on me.
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.
I just wanted to be like you.
And I wanted you to be better.
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.
- For how long?
- Forever.
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.
- Let's have it.
- Please, this is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Okay?
God, I sound like my dad.
I don't have any other clothes.
Okay, we'll sort that out.
L- ley-
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.
You can't do that.
Then this ferry thing happens.
I've called five police stations.
Five.
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.
Cut the bullshit.
I know you left detention.
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.
That's not fine.
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.
It's just me and you.
I lost the Stark internship.
- What?
- Yeah.
What happened?
I just thought that I could work really hard
and he could-- He would-- You know.
But I screwed it up.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I made you worry.
I'm not trying to ruin your life.
Yeah, I know.
Just--
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.
And take a shower. You smell.
You smell like garbage.
I know.
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?
Okay.
All right, get out of here.
Are you expelled?
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.
You're so lucky.
L- ley-
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.
Hey, look, I--
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.
It's fine.
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.
No, I'm--
I just mean that...
...it was not cool, especially...
...because...
...I like you.
I know.
You do?
You're terrible at keeping secrets.
Yeah, you'd be surprised.
I got to get to class, but--
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...
...forever, but--
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so--
Do you want to...
...go with me?
Yeah. Sure.
Really? I mean, great. Cool.
Cool.
I'm actually going that way.
May, I need your help.
Through or around?
Right?
It's game day. So, what's the plan?
Open the door for her.
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.
- Don't be creepy.
- No.
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.
I got this.
- Love you.
- Bye.
You must be Peter.
Yeah.
I'm Liz's dad.
Put her there.
Hell of a grip.
Come on in here. Come on.
Hi, Peter.
You look very handsome.
Thank you.
You got his name right?
- Freddie?
- Peter.
Peter. Peter.
I'm gonna go get Liz.
Okay.
You all right, Pete?
Yeah.
Because you look pale.
You want something to drink?
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?
I'm not old enough to drink.
That's the right answer.
- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.
Doesn't she, Pete?
Yeah, you look really good.
Once again, that's the right answer.
Is that a corsage?
Thanks.
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.
Okay. Come on, you guys.
Peter, closer.
Smile.
There you go.
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.
I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.
- Thank you.
- Promise.
He's cute.
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.
Come on, Pedro.
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.
Just saying, you know.
All you guys who go to that school...
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.
Really? Stark?
So cool.
What do you do?
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got...
...boring.
It was boring?
You got to hang outwith Spider-Man.
Really? Spider-Man?
What's he like?
Yeah, he's nice.
Nice man.
Solid dude.
Look. So cute.
I've seen you around, right? I mean...
...somewhere. We've-- Have we ever-- ?
Because even the voice--
He does Academic Decathlon with me.
And he was at my party.
It was a great party, really great, yeah.
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.
That was-- I was there longer
than two seconds.
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.
Were you scared?
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...
...showed up in the elevator though, huh?
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.
I saw it all from the ground.
Yeah.
Very lucky that he was there that day.
Good old Spider-Man.
Dad, the light.
Here we are. End of the line.
Thanks, Dad.
You head in there, gumdrop.
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.
Don't let him intimidate you.
Love you.
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.
Hi.
You guys look so pretty.
Does she know?
Know what?
So she doesn't. Good.
Close t0 the vest.
I admire that.
I've got a few secrets of my own.
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...
Peter...
...nothing is more important than family.
You saved my daughter's life.
I could never forget something like that.
So I'm gonna give you one chance.
Are you ready?
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...
...and don't you ever, ever...
...interfere with my business again.
Because if you do...
...I'll kill you...
...and everybody you love.
I'll kill you dead.
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?
L- ley-
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?
Just not too good.
L- ley-
What did he say to you?
Gotta go.
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this.
He gave you a choice.
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?
What's with the crappy costume?
My web-shooters.
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but damn.
Gross.
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.
Nice shot!
Yes!
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.
Get a computer and track my phone.
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...
...before he leaves town.
I'm sorry about dinner...
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So--
Flash, I need your car and phone.
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't--
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?
- Go for Ned.
- Ned, I need you...
- ...to track my phone.
- Yeah, but where is it?
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. it's--
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move!
Are you okay'?
- I've never driven before...
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.
Hey, have you gotten through
to Happy yet?
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
Guy in the chair.
Takeoff in nine minutes.
Hello? Hello? Who Is this?
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
- Who?
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you--
You gotta be shitting me.
Damn.
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.
Left, okay.
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.
It sounded like he was catching a flight.
He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.
- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.
Boxes? It's moving day.
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.
I gotta stop him!
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster Armor...
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging--
The Meg-- The--
Thor's magic belt.
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.
- What?
- Turn right.
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.
I'm...
...looking...
...at porn.
Hey!
Surprised?
Oh, hey, Pete.
I didn't hear you come in.
It's over. I've got you.
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...
...I really, really admire your grit.
I see why Liz likes you.
I do. When you first came to the house...
...I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.
How could you do this to her?
To her?
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.
I'm doing this for her.
Yeah.
Peter...
...you're young.
You don't understand
how the world works.
But I understand that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.
How do you think
your buddy Stark paid for that tower?
Or any of his little toys?
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.
Guys like us...
...like you and me...
...they don't care about us.
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.
That's how it is.
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to understand.
And...
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.
I'm sorry, Peter.
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.
True. Then again...
...wasn't really trying to.
Chief, they're powering up engines.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, ready?
Hello?
Hello!
Please, hey.
Hey, please. I'm down here.
I'm down here. I'm stuck.
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't--
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Come on, Peter.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man!
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.
Oh, yeah.
Retroreflective panels engaged.
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.
It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.
Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.
This better work, Mason.
Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life.
Yeah.
You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...
...and override their security.
Cloning transponder signal.
Launching decoy drone.
Entering new coordinates.
Good, so it's on its way.
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.
All right.
Hot dog.
Just a typical homecoming...
...on the outside of an invisible jet...
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.
Oh, God!
I can't believe that worked.
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.
I'm not going home empty-handed.
Oh, my God.
- Get out of there. What are you doing?
- Please turn, please turn!
Hey, Pedro.
Bingo.
Your wingsuit.
Your wingsuit's going to explode!
Time to go home, Pete.
I'm trying to save you!
No.
No.
It looked so insane. That whole--
Like, it was just crazy.
He-- He was just, like...
And you were like...
And then I just hit him with the...
It was so-- Oh, my God.
I mean, you saved me.
It was awesome.
Hey, Liz.
I'm gonna miss you.
Bye.
Liz.
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?
The dance?
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.
Well, yeah, but I--
I mean, your dad-- I can't imagine
what you're going through.
If there's anything I can do to help...
I guess we're moving to Oregon.
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So...
Liz, I-- I--
Bye, Peter.
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.
Yeah!
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...
...but just for motivation right now
at this practice.
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...
...a new team captain next year.
So I am appointing Michelle.
Yeah!
Thank you.
My-- My friends call me MJ.
I thought you didn't have any friends.
I didn't.
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?
What are you hiding, Peter?
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.
Hey, Happy. What-- ?
What are you doing here?
I really owe you one.
I don't know what I would do
without this job.
I mean, before I met Tony--
So how long you been here?
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.
Upstate-- Like, upstate-upstate?
Yeah, let's go.
Take a look.
It's pretty impressive, huh?
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.
How was the ride up?
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
I gotta talk to the kid.
I'll be close behind.
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.
Sorry I took your suit.
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...
...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.
- Mr. Stark, I really--
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.
But then you did the right thing.
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...
All right, not my best analogy.
I was wrong about you.
I think, with a little more mentoring...
...you could be a real asset to the team.
- To the-- ? To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.
When you're ready...
...why don't you try that on?
And I'll introduce the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:
Spider-Man.
'Can-
Yeah, give that a look.
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...
...your new quarters.
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.
Or walls.
You'll fit right in.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
But I'm good.
You're good? Good-- ?
How are you good?
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?
You're turning me down?
You better think about this.
Look at that.
Look at me.
Last chance. Yes or no?
- No.
- Okay.
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.
Happy will take you home.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.
- See you around.
- Okay.
That was a test, right?
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
Yeah, thank you.
Told you he's a good kid.
- Where's the kid?
- He left.
- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?
Think of something. How about...?
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I-- ? I-- ?
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?
I've been carrying this since 2008.
Okay.
I think I can think
of something better than that.
Well, it would buy us a little time.
Like we need time.
I can't believe you have that
in your pocket.
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?
May?
What 'the-l?!
Look who it is.
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?
Relax.
This? It's not on you.
It's on our little spider friend.
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.
And I heard a rumor.
You know who he is.
If I knew who he was...
...he'd already be dead.
Toomes, your family's here!
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.
Patience.
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.
Sometimes it leads to very little...
...and it seems like it's not worth it.
And you wonder...
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.
How many more of these?

This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel Statesman.
We are under assault.
I repeat,
we are under assault.
The engines are dead,
life support failing.
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.
We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.
Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.
We have
very few soldiers here.
This is not a warcraft.
I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.
Hear me and rejoice.
You have had the privilege
of being saved
by the Great Titan.
You may think
this is suffering.
No.
It is salvation.
Universal scales
tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.
Smile.
For even in death,
you have become
Children of Thanos.
I know what it's like to lose.
To feel so desperately
that you're right...
yet to fail, nonetheless.
It's frightening.
Turns the legs to jelly.
But I ask you, to what end?
Dread it, run from it...
destiny arrives all the same.
And now, it's here.
Or should I say...
I am.
You talk too much.
The Tesseract.
Or your brother's head.
I assume you have
a preference.
Oh, I do.
Kill away.
All right, stop!
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.
You really are
the worst brother.
I assure you, brother...
the sun will shine
on us again.
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.
And for another...
we have a Hulk.
Let him have his fun.
Allfathers...
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...
time.
That was a mistake.
No!
You're going to die for that.
Shh.
My humble personage...
bows before your grandeur.
No other being
has ever had the might...
nay, the nobility...
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.
The universe lies
within your grasp.
There are two more stones
on Earth.
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.
Father,
we will not fail you.
If I might interject.
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.
If you consider
failure experience.
I consider
experience experience.
Almighty Thanos...
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...
Odinson...
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...
god of mischief...
do hereby pledge to you...
my undying fidelity.
Undying?
You should choose your words
more carefully.
You...
will never be...
a god.
No!
No resurrections this time.
No. Loki.
Seriously,
you don't have any money?
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.
Dollars?
- Rupees.
- Which is?
Uh, buck and a half.
What do you want?
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.
Thanos is coming.
He's coming.
Who?
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.
You're totally rambling.
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,
and in the dream
you gotta pee.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."
And then you wake up
and in real life
you actually have to pee.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.
It was so real.
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.
Uh, what was his name?
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.
...and thought that we were...
- Expecting.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- No.
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.
If you wanted to have a kid...
you wouldn't have done that.
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.
You're not helping
your case, okay?
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...
You don't need that.
I know, I had the surgery.
I'm just
trying to protect us...
and future usses
and that's it.
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.
You know me so well.
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.
You should have shirts
in your closet.
Yeah.
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.
Show off this Harry Winston.
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.
I should promise you.
- Yes.
- I will.
Thank you.
Tony Stark.
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?
We need your help.
It's not overselling it
to say that
the fate of the universe
is at stake.
And who's "we"?
Hey, Tony.
Bruce.
- Pepper.
- Hi.
- Oh.
- You okay?
At the dawn
of the universe,
there was nothing. Then...
Boom.
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...
hurtling across
the virgin universe.
These Infinity Stones
each control an essential
aspect of existence.
Space.
Reality.
Power.
Soul.
Mind.
And Time.
Tell me his name again.
Thanos.
He's a plague, Tony.
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.
He wipes out
half the population.
He sent Loki.
The attack on New York,
that's him.
This is it.
What's our timeline?
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.
That already makes him
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...
He could destroy life
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Is that what it is?
I'm going to allow that.
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?
No can do.
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.
And I swore off dairy...
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.
A bit chalky.
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.
Point is, things change.
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.
Yeah, so conversely,
it may also be
his best chance against us.
Well, if we don't do our jobs.
What is your job exactly?
Besides making
balloon animals.
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?
The fact is
we have this stone.
We know where it is.
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...
and we have to find him now.
Yeah, that's the thing.
What do you mean?
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.
He's offline.
- What?
- Yeah.
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.
Who could find Vision then?
Shit.
Probably Steve Rogers.
Oh, great.
Maybe.
But...
Call him.
It's not that easy.
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?
No.
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.
Broke up?
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?
Cap and I fell out hard.
We're not on speaking terms.
Tony, listen to me.
Thor's gone.
Thanos is coming.
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.
Flip phone.
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be
moving your hair, would ya?
Not at the moment, no.
You okay?
- Help him!
- Banner!
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!
Friday, what am I looking at?
Not sure.
I'm working on it.
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone
in your back pocket, Doc!
Might wanna use it.
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.
Holy shit.
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!
What's the matter
with you kids?
You never seen
a spaceship before?
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.
Notify first responders.
Will do.
Hear me and rejoice.
You are about to die
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.
Be thankful...
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.
You better pack it up
and get outta here.
Stonekeeper.
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.
He means get lost, Squidward.
He exhausts me.
Bring me the stone.
Banner, you want a piece?
Mmm, no, not really.
But when do I ever get
what I want?
That's right.
Okay. Push!
It's been a while.
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.
Okay. Shh.
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.
Come on, come on, man.
God!
Where's your guy?
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.
It's okay.
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.
- I have him.
- Damn it.
Where'd that come from?
It's nanotech.
You like it?
A little something I...
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend
won't be joining us...
Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.
It stays with me.
Exactly. Bye.
Tony, you okay?
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?
I'm trying. He won't come out.
Hammer.
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?
Come out! Come out! Come out!
No!
What do you mean, "no"?
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?
Uh, he's from space.
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.
Your powers are quaint.
You must be popular
with children.
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.
You'll only wish
you were dead.
No!
Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.
On it!
Not cool.
Gotcha!
Wait!
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.
Hang on, kid.
Oh!
Ugh.
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.
Give me a little juice,
Friday.
Unlock 17:A.
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.
But you said
save the wizard!
I can't breathe.
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.
Yeah. That makes sense.
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!
Happy trails, kid.
- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.
Oh, come on!
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.
Tony? Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
What's going on?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.
Why?
Just 'cause
I'll probably
not make it back for a while.
Tell me
you're not on that ship.
Yeah.
God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.
Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.
- Pep.
- Come back here right now.
Come back.
Boss,
we're losing her.
I'm going too.
Oh, my God!
I shoulda stayed on the bus.
Where you going?
The Time Stone's been taken.
The Sanctum remains unguarded.
What will you do?
I'm gonna make a call.
Sing it, Drax!
Why are we doing this again?
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.
Someone could be dying.
I get that,
but why are we doing it?
'Cause we're nice.
And maybe whoever it is
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...
We take his ship.
- Exactly!
- Bingo!
All right!
We are arriving.
All right, Guardians,
don't forget
this might be dangerous...
so let's put on
our mean faces.
Groot, put that
thing away, now.
I don't wanna tell you again.
Groot.
I am Groot!
- Whoa!
- Language!
- Hey!
- Wow.
You got some
acorns on you, kid.
Ever since
you got a little sap,
you're a total d-hole.
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Looks like
we're not getting paid.
Wipers! Wipers!
Get it off.
How the hell
is this dude still alive?
He is not a dude.
You're a dude.
This... This is a man.
A handsome, muscular man.
I'm muscular.
But who are you
kidding, Quill?
You're one sandwich
away from fat.
Yeah, right.
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.
What?
Gamora, do you think I'm...
He is anxious, angry.
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.
Wow.
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?
It's like his muscles
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.
Stop massaging his muscles.
Wake him up.
Wake.
Who the hell are you guys?
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.
To bring balance
to the universe
by wiping out
half of all life.
He used to kill people
planet by planet,
massacre by massacre.
Including my own.
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.
Your father killed my brother.
Oh, boy.
Stepfather, technically.
And she hates him
as much as you do.
Families can be tough.
Before my father died,
he told me
that I had a half-sister...
that he imprisoned in Hel.
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.
So I had to kill her.
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.
Goes round and round and...
I feel your pain.
I feel your pain as well,
because...
I mean,
it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.
My father killed my mother.
And then I had to kill
my father.
That was hard.
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...
I need a hammer, not a spoon.
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.
No, you're not.
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?
- No.
- You are.
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.
No, I'm not.
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.
Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.
He's trying to copy me.
I need you to stop doing that.
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.
We need to stop Thanos.
Which means
we need to find out
where he's going next.
Knowhere.
He must be going somewhere.
No, no. Knowhere?
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?
Because for years...
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there
with a man
called the Collector.
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...
he's not going
for one of the other stones?
There are six stones
out there.
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.
He stole the Space Stone
from me...
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.
Like Kevin Bacon?
He may be on the team.
I don't know.
I haven't been there
in a while.
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.
No one even knows where it is.
Therefore Thanos can't get it.
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?
That place is a legend.
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons
to ever torment the universe.
I would very much like
to go there, please.
The rabbit is correct
and clearly the smartest
among you.
Rabbit?
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.
I assume
you're the captain, sir.
You're very perceptive.
You seem like a noble leader.
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.
Quiet.
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.
Look, this is my ship.
And I'm not goin' to...
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?
The Thanos-killing kind.
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.
Your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed
into madness.
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.
If we don't go to Knowhere
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...
he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.
We got two ships
and a large assortment
of morons.
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.
And the morons
will go to Knowhere
to try to stop Thanos.
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.
For the record...
I know that
you're going with him
because it's where
Thanos isn't.
You know, you really shouldn't
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.
Come on, Groot.
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.
Bye.
Vis?
Is it the stone again?
It's as if
it's speaking to me.
What does it say?
I don't... I don't know,
but something.
Hey.
Tell me what you feel.
I just feel you.
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...
which would give us more time
together before you went back.
What if
I miss that train?
There's an 11:00.
What if I missed
all the trains?
What if this time
I didn't go back?
But you gave Stark your word.
I'd rather give it to you.
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.
We both made promises.
Not to each other.
Wanda.
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...
trying to see
if this could work and...
I don't know.
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.
I think...
- It works.
- It works.
It works.
Stay.
Stay with me.
Or not. If I'm overstepping...
What are they?
What the stone
was warning me about.
I have to go.
No, Vision.
Vision, if that's true,
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.
Wanda, I...
Vision!
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.
My systems are failing.
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.
Vis!
Give up the stone,
and she lives.
Hands off.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, you gotta get up.
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.
Hey. We have to go.
Please. Please leave.
You asked me to stay.
- I'm staying.
- Please.
- Get up.
- I can't.
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.
You'll never get
the chance again.
Can you stand?
Thank you, Captain.
Let's get you on the jet.
Now, I thought we had a deal.
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.
I'm sorry.
We just wanted time.
Where to, Cap?
Home.
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.
Zehobereians.
Mother! Where's my mother?
Choose a side or die.
Mother!
One side
is a revelation...
the other an honor
known only to a few.
What's wrong, little one?
My mother. Where is my mother?
What's your name?
Gamora.
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.
Come.
Let me help you.
Look.
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.
Too much to one side
or the other...
Here. You try.
Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.
Uh-uh.
Concentrate.
There. You've got it.
Gamora.
Do you know if these grenades
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?
Because I was thinking about
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.
But I don't want to
if they're the...
I need to ask a favor.
Yeah, sure.
One way or another,
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.
Which is what
the grenades are for.
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?
If things go wrong...
If Thanos gets me...
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.
What?
I know something he doesn't.
And if he finds it out,
the entire universe
could be at risk.
What do you know?
If I tell you, you'd know too.
If it's so important...
shouldn't I?
Only if you wanna die.
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?
Just...
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would. But you...
Swear to me.
Swear to me on your mother.
Okay.
Okay.
- Oh.
- Dude.
How long have you been
standing there?
An hour.
An hour?
Are you serious?
I've mastered the ability
of standing
so incredibly still...
that I become
invisible to the eye.
Watch.
You're eating a zarg-nut.
But my movement...
was so slow...
that it's imperceptible.
Mmm, no.
I'm sure I'm invisible.
Hi, Drax.
Damn it.
This place looks deserted.
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.
Yep,
I'm picking that up too.
Let's put down right here.
I don't have it.
Everyone
in the galaxy knows
you'd sell your own brother...
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...
to your pathetic collection.
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.
I told you.
I sold it.
Why would I lie?
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.
Like suicide.
You do understand.
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.
I didn't know what it was.
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.
It's him.
Last chance,
charlatan.
Where's the stone?
Today...
Drax. Drax.
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.
Drax, wait.
Not yet, not yet, not yet.
Drax.
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.
He doesn't have the stone yet.
If we get it,
then we can stop him.
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.
No.
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.
Sleep.
Okay.
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.
The other right.
Why?
Why you, daughter?
That was quick.
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!
Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.
But one never knows for sure.
Reality is often
disappointing.
That is, it was.
Now...
reality can be
whatever I want.
You knew I'd come.
I counted on it.
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.
Thanos!
No!
Let her go, Grimace.
Peter.
I told you to go right.
Now? Really?
You let her go!
Ah, the boyfriend.
No.
Like to think of myself
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.
- Let her go.
- Peter.
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.
Not him.
You promised. You promised.
Oh, daughter.
You expect too much from him.
She's asked, hasn't she?
Do it.
Mmm.
Do it!
I told you to go right.
I love you more than anything.
I love you too.
I like him.
Still no word from Vision?
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.
On a stolen Quinjet
with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.
You know they're
only criminals because
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?
My God, Rhodes.
Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.
If it weren't
for those Accords,
Vision would've been
right here.
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.
That's right.
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.
You have second thoughts?
Not anymore.
Mr. Secretary.
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.
You could use
some of that right now.
The world's on fire.
And you think all is forgiven?
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.
And I'm way past
asking permission.
Earth just lost
her best defender.
So we're here to fight.
And if you wanna
stand in our way...
we'll fight you too.
Arrest them.
All over it.
That's a court-martial.
It's great to see you, Cap.
You too, Rhodey.
Hey.
Wow. You guys...
really look like crap.
Must've been
a rough couple years.
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.
Uh, I think
you look great.
Uh...
Yeah, I'm back.
Hi, Bruce.
Nat.
This is awkward.
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?
And they can clearly find us.
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?
After the whole
Accords situation,
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough
on their families.
They're on house arrest.
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?
Okay, look.
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...
Vision's stone.
Then we have to protect it.
No, we have to destroy it.
I've been giving
a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head.
About its nature.
But also its composition.
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...
its molecular integrity
could fail.
Yeah, and you with it.
We're not having
this conversation.
Eliminating the stone
is the only way
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.
That's too high a price.
Only you have
the power to pay it.
Thanos threatens
half the universe.
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.
But it should.
We don't trade lives, Vision.
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...
to save how many
millions of people?
Tell me,
why is this any different?
Because you might
have a choice.
Your mind is made up
of a complex construct
of overlays.
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.
All of them mixed together,
all of them
learning from one another.
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.
Perhaps the best parts.
Can we do that?
Not me, not here.
Well,
you better find someone
and somewhere fast.
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys
have your old rooms back.
I know somewhere.
The Kingsguard
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.
And the Border Tribe?
Those that are left.
Send word
to the Jabari as well.
M'Baku likes a good fight.
And what of this one?
This one may be tired of war.
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.
Where's the fight?
On its way.
In all the time
I've served Thanos...
I have never failed him.
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...
with the Time Stone
still attached
to your vaguely
irritating person...
there would be judgment.
Give me...
the stone.
Wow, you're a seriously
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?
Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...
What the...
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.
God damn it.
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.
And now, I'm here in space.
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.
This is a one-way ticket.
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.
No, I did think this through.
You could not have possibly
thought this through.
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...
if there's no neighborhood.
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,
but you know
what I'm trying to say.
Come on. We got a situation.
See him down there?
He's in trouble.
What's your plan?
- Go.
- Um...
Okay, okay... Uh...
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?
Painful, aren't they?
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.
And any one of them...
could end your friend's life
in an instant.
I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.
You've saved nothing.
Your powers
are inconsequential
compared to mine.
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.
Yes! Wait.
What are those?
Hey,
we haven't officially met.
Cool.
We gotta turn
this ship around.
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.
No, I want to protect
the stone.
And I want you
to thank me.
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.
I seriously don't know
how you fit your head
into that helmet.
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.
I tried to bench you.
You refused.
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.
And due to that fact,
we're now
in a flying doughnut...
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.
What is he, your ward?
No.
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...
I'm Spider-Man, then.
This ship is
self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.
Can we control it?
Fly us home?
- Stark?
- Yeah.
Can you get us home?
Yeah, I heard you.
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.
Under no circumstances
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.
I don't think
you quite understand
what's at stake here.
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.
Since he sent an army
to New York
and now he's back.
And I don't know what to do.
So I'm not so sure
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.
So I say we take
the fight to him.
Doctor.
Do you concur?
All right, Stark.
We go to him.
But you have to understand...
if it comes to saving you
or the kid
or the Time Stone...
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.
Nice. Good, moral compass.
We're straight.
All right, kid.
You're an Avenger now.
I thought
you might be hungry.
I always hated that chair.
So I've been told.
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.
I hated this room.
This ship.
I hated my life.
You told me that too.
Every day.
For almost 20 years.
I was a child
when you took me.
I saved you.
No.
No. We were happy
on my home planet.
Going to bed hungry...
scrounging for scraps.
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.
Do you know
what's happened since then?
The children born...
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.
Because you murdered
half the planet.
A small price to pay
for salvation.
You're insane.
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.
It needs correction.
You don't know that!
I'm the only one
who knows that.
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.
For a time...
you had that same will...
as you fought by my side.
Daughter.
I'm not your daughter.
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.
And, in doing so,
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
I am disappointed.
But not because
you didn't find it.
But because you did.
And you lied.
Nebula.
Don't do this.
Some time ago,
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.
Please don't do this.
And very nearly succeeded.
So I brought her here.
To talk.
Stop. Stop it.
I swear to you on my life.
I never found the Soul Stone.
Accessing memory files.
You know
what he's about to do.
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.
- All of them.
- He can never get them all.
He will!
He can't, Nebula.
Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...
and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.
You're strong.
Me.
You're generous.
Me.
But I never taught you to lie.
That's why
you're so bad at it.
Where is the Soul Stone?
Vormir!
The stone is on Vormir.
Show me.
I am Groot.
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking.
What's there to see?
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.
I am Groot.
Tree, pour what's in the cup
out into space
and go in the cup again.
You speak Groot?
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.
I am Groot.
You'll know when we're close.
Nidavellir's forge harnesses
the blazing power
of a neutron star.
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.
It's truly awesome.
Okay, time to be the captain.
So, dead brother, huh?
Yeah, that could be annoying.
Well, he's been dead before.
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.
And you said
your sister and your dad?
Both dead.
But still got a mom, though?
Killed by a dark elf.
A best friend?
Stabbed through the heart.
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?
Absolutely.
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...
they're all
tremendous motivators.
They really clear the mind.
So I'm good to go.
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...
he's the toughest there is.
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.
He's never fought me twice.
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.
It better be some hammer.
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,
but none succeeded.
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.
Fate wills it so.
Mmm-hmm.
And what if you're wrong?
If I'm wrong, then...
what more could I lose?
I could lose a lot.
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.
Okay.
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?
- What's it look like?
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.
He gave you his eye?
No, he gave me 100 credits.
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.
Thank you, sweet rabbit.
Hmm.
Huh?
Oh.
I would've washed that.
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...
Hey, we're here!
I don't think
this thing works.
Everything seems dark.
It ain't the eye.
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.
And the rings are frozen.
I hope
these dwarves are better
at forging
than they are cleaning.
Maybe they realized
that they live
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?
Yes, why?
It look
anything like that?
I am Groot.
Go back to the pod.
Eitri, wait!
Stop!
Stop.
Thor?
What happened here?
You were supposed
to protect us.
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.
Asgard is destroyed.
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.
I made what he wanted.
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.
Then he killed
everyone anyway.
All except me.
"Your life is yours," he said.
"But your hands
are mine alone."
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.
Every weapon
you've ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword...
it's all inside your head.
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.
Mantis, listen very carefully.
I need you
to meet me on Titan.
Hey, what's going on?
I think we're here.
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.
Close those around it.
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.
We might wanna turn.
Turn! Turn! Turn!
You all right?
That was close.
I owe you one.
Let me just say, if aliens
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.
I do not want another
single pop culture reference
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.
Thanos!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!
Stay down, clown.
Die, blanket of death!
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.
Where is Gamora?
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!
Do it, Quill! I can take it.
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.
I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.
Starting with you.
Wait, what, Thanos?
All right, let me ask you
this one time.
What master do you serve?
What master do I serve?
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?
You're from Earth.
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.
Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?
So you're not
with Thanos?
With Thanos?
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.
You're the ones
Thor told us about.
You know Thor?
Yeah.
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.
Where is he now?
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?
It's a mold.
A king's weapon.
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.
Did it have a name?
Stormbreaker.
That's a bit much.
So how do we make it?
You'll have to restart
the forge.
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.
Rabbit, fire up the pod.
The hell happened
to this planet?
It's eight degrees
off its axis.
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.
Or at least
the beginnings of one.
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,
pin him down,
get what we need.
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.
We just want the gauntlet.
Are you yawning?
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?
Did you hear what I said?
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?
Kick names, take ass.
Yeah, that's right.
All right, just get over here,
please.
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.
We gotta coalesce.
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...
and that way
it might be really good.
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.
Like in Footloose, the movie?
Exactly like Footloose.
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?
It never was.
Don't encourage this,
all right?
- Okay.
- We're getting no help
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?
By the way,
that's a compliment.
Don't forget, I'm half human.
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...
that's 100% you.
Your math
is blowing my mind.
Excuse me.
But does your friend
often do that?
Strange, we all right?
You're back. You're all right.
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.
To see all
the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.
How many did you see?
14,000,605.
How many did we win?
One.
The stone
had better be up there.
For your sister's sake.
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
You know us?
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.
Where is the Soul Stone?
You should know...
it extracts a terrible price.
I am prepared.
We all think that at first.
We are all wrong.
How is it you know
this place so well?
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out,
banished me here.
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.
What you seek
lies in front of you.
As does what you fear.
What's this?
The price.
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.
Tell me what it needs.
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...
understands its power...
the stone demands a sacrifice.
Of what?
In order to take the stone,
you must lose
that which you love.
A soul...
for a soul.
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...
a moment...
when you got
what you deserved.
And I was always
so disappointed.
But now...
You kill and torture...
and you call it mercy.
The universe has judged you.
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.
You failed.
And do you wanna know why?
Because you love nothing.
No one.
No.
Really?
Tears?
They're not for him.
No.
This isn't love.
I ignored my destiny once.
I cannot do that again.
Even for you.
I'm sorry, little one.
No!
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.
I hope you're right
about this.
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda
to the rest of the world...
this is not what I imagined.
And what did you imagine?
The Olympics.
Maybe even a Starbucks.
Should we bow?
Yeah, he's a king.
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.
What are you doing?
Uh, we don't do that here.
So how big of an assault
should we expect?
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.
How we looking?
You will have my Kingsguard,
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.
How you been, Buck?
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.
Whoa.
The structure is polymorphic.
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.
Why didn't you just reprogram
the synapses
to work collectively?
Because we didn't think of it.
I'm sure you did your best.
Can you do it?
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.
It will take time, brother.
How long?
As long as you can give me.
Something's entered
the atmosphere.
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.
God, I love this place.
Yeah, don't
start celebrating yet, guys.
We got more incoming
outside the dome.
It's too late.
We need to destroy
the stone now.
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.
We will hold them off.
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...
you blow it to hell.
I will.
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.
And get this man a shield.
I don't think
you get the scientifics here.
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...
you're gonna need something
a lot bigger
to yank 'em loose.
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...
Fire the engines!
More power, rabbit!
Well done, boy.
That's Nidavellir.
Damn it.
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?
The mechanism
is crippled.
- What?
- With the iris closed,
I can't heat the metal.
How long will it take
to heat it?
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?
I'm gonna hold it open.
That's suicide.
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.
How we looking, Bruce?
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.
Wow! This is amazing, man.
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through
the tree line.
Thank you
for standing with us.
Where's your other friend?
You will pay for his life
with yours.
Thanos will have that stone.
That's not gonna happen.
You are in Wakanda now.
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.
We have blood to spare.
They surrender?
Not exactly.
What the hell?
Looks like we pissed her off.
They're killing themselves.
You see the teeth
on those things?
All right, back up, Sam.
You're gonna get
your wings singed.
Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter
and get in behind us...
there's nothing
between them and Vision.
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.
How do we do that?
We open the barrier.
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.
Requesting
confirmation, My King.
You said open the barrier?
On my signal.
This will be
the end of Wakanda.
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.
Wakanda forever!
Now!
How much longer, Shuri?
I've barely begun, brother.
You might want to pick up
the pace.
Allfathers, give me strength.
You understand, boy?
You're about to take
the full force of a star.
It'll kill you.
Only if I die.
Yes.
That's what killing you means.
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!
Thor! Say something. Come on.
Thor, you okay?
I think he's dying.
He needs the axe!
Where's the handle?
Tree, help me find the handle!
There's too many of 'em!
You guys
are so screwed now!
Bring me Thanos!
Oh, yeah.
You're much more of a Thanos.
I take it the Maw is dead.
This day
extracts a heavy toll.
Still, he accomplished
his mission.
You may regret that.
He brought you face-to-face
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.
And where do you think
he brought you?
Let me guess. Your home?
It was.
And it was beautiful.
Titan was like most planets.
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.
Genocide.
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.
They called me a madman.
And what I predicted
came to pass.
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.
I'm a survivor.
Who wants to murder trillions.
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.
And then what?
I'd finally rest...
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.
Our?
Piece of cake, Quill.
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.
Boom!
Don't let him close his fist.
Magic.
More magic.
Magic with a kick.
Magic with a...
Insect!
Well, well.
You should've killed me.
It would've been
a waste of parts!
Where's Gamora?
Is he under?
Don't let up.
Be quick. He is very strong.
Parker, help! Get over here.
She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.
For the record,
this was my plan.
You're not so strong now, huh?
Where is Gamora?
My Gamora.
No, bullshit!
Where is she?
He is in anguish.
Good.
He... He mourns.
What does
this monster have to mourn?
Gamora.
What?
He took her to Vormir.
He came back
with the Soul Stone.
But she didn't.
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!
Tell me she's lying.
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!
I had to.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!
Oh, God.
Come and get some,
space dogs!
Come on! Get some! Get some!
Come on! Get some!
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.
Okay. How much for the arm?
Oh, I'll get that arm.
New haircut?
Noticed you've copied
my beard.
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.
I am Groot.
I am Steve Rogers.
Fall back! Fall back, now!
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.
I'm doing it.
Why was she up there
all this time?
She's on the field. Take it.
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.
Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him!
- On my way.
He'll die alone. As will you.
She's not alone.
Oh, no, you don't.
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.
What? No! No!
Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!
Hulk? Hulk,
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.
Hulk! Hulk!
Hulk!
No!
Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!
I'll do it myself!
Come on! Yeah!
See ya!
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.
I thought you were formidable,
machine.
But you're dying,
like any man.
Get outta here!
Go!
That was really gross.
I thought I told you to go.
We don't trade lives, Captain.
I got you. I got you.
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.
You're full of tricks, wizard.
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.
A fake.
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.
Stark.
You know me?
I do.
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.
My only curse is you.
Come on!
All that for a drop of blood.
You have my respect, Stark.
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.
I hope they remember you.
Stop.
Spare his life...
and I will give you the stone.
No tricks.
Don't.
One to go.
Where is he?
Did we just lose?
Why would you do that?
We're in the endgame now.
Are you okay?
What? What is it?
He's here.
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.
What the hell?
Cap.
That's him.
Eyes up. Stay sharp.
Wanda.
It's time.
No.
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.
Look at me.
You have the power
to destroy the stone.
Don't.
You must do it. Wanda, please.
We are out of time.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can.
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.
It's not fair.
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.
It's all right.
You could never hurt me.
I just feel you.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I love you.
I understand, my child.
Better than anyone.
You could never.
Today, I lost more
than you can know.
But now is no time to mourn.
Now is no time at all.
No!
I told you...
you'd die for that.
You should have...
You should...
You should have
gone for the head.
No!
Daughter?
Did you do it?
Yes.
What did it cost?
Everything.
What did you do?
What'd you do?
Where'd he go?
Thor.
Where'd he go?
Steve?
Up, General. Up!
This is no place to die.
I am Groot.
Oh...
No, no, no!
Groot! No.
Sam!
Sam, where you at?
Something's happening.
Quill?
Steady, Quill.
Oh, man.
Tony.
There was no other way.
Mr. Stark?
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.
I don't know...
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.
I'm sorry.
He did it.
What is this?
What the hell is happening?
Oh, God.
Still no word
from Stark?
No, not yet.
We're watching every satellite
on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.
What is it?
Multiple bogeys
over Wakanda.
Same energy signature
as New York?
Ten times bigger.
Tell Klein
we'll meet him at...
Nick! Nick!
They okay?
There's no one here.
Call Control.
Code red.
Nick.
Hill.
Oh, no.
Mother...
BOY: Baba...
MAN: Yes, my son.
BOY: Tell me a story.
MAN: (CHUCKLES) Which one?
The story of home.
Millions of years ago...
a meteorite
made of vibranium...
the strongest substance
in the universe...
struck the continent
of Africa...
affecting the plant life
around it.
And when
the time of man came...
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...
until a warrior shaman...
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...
a plant that granted him
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.
The warrior became king...
and the first Black Panther...
the protector of Wakanda.
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...
more advanced
than any other nation.
But as Wakanda thrived...
the world around it descended
further into chaos.
To keep vibranium safe...
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...
keeping the truth
of their power
from the outside world.
And we still hide, Baba?
Yes.
BOY: Why?
(IN THE TRUNK
BY TOO $HORT PLAYING)
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!
Whatever!
Get outta here!
Check up.
Pick your man up! He open.
Where you at?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Pass! Pass!
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!
Watch me get this.
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.
KID: Come on.
BOY: What you got?
You ain't got nothing.
MAN: Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,
won't be no worries.
You in the van,
come in through from the west.
Come around the corner.
- Land right here.
- Mmm-hmm.
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...
(FAINT RUSTLING)
Hide the straps.
Yo, is it the Feds?
No.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.
They're holding spears.
Open it.
JAMES: You serious?
They won't knock again.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Prove to me you are one of us.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
My King.
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.
As you wish.
At ease.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Come, baby brother.
how you are holding up.
You look strong.
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.
How is home?
Not so good.
(IN XHOSA) Baby brother.
There has been an attack.
This man...
Ulysses Klaue...
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.
Many lives were lost.
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...
and how to strike.
He had someone on the inside.
Why are you here?
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.
I did no such thing.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Tell him who you are.
Zuri, son of Badu...
What?
James. James, you lied to me?
Leave him.
You were Wakandan
this whole time?
You betrayed Wakanda!
How could you lie
to me like...
Stand down.
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?
Prince N'Jobu...
you will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
Check up!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Guard your man,
guard your man!
Yo.
REPORTER:
The tiny nation of Wakanda
is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.
The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...
after a terrorist attack
at the United Nations
a week ago.
The suspect
has since been apprehended.
Though it remains one of
the poorest countries
in the world...
fortified by
mountain ranges...
and an impenetrable
rainforest...
Wakanda does not engage
in international trade
or accept aid.
The succession
of the throne...
is expected to fall
to the oldest
of the king's two children...
Prince T'Challa.
OKOYE: My Prince...
coming up on them now.
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.
Hmm.
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.
Just don't freeze
when you see her.
What are you talking about?
I never freeze.
(MEN GRUNTING)
MILITANT 1: What's going on?
MILITANT 2: It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.
The car no start.
MILITANT 3: What happened?
MILITANT 4: The engine failed.
MILITANT 1: Ours, too.
What is it, Captain?
- Defense positions.
- (GUNS COCKING)
Defense positions.
MILITANT 2:
Are we under attack?
Defense positions.
Get around to the side.
Defense positions.
Hey. Defense positions!
No games.
(BARKING)
What do you see?
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
- Come in. Come in.
- (SCREAMS)
Over there! Look back!
Watch out!
(ALL SCREAMING AND GRUNTING)
NAKIA: T'Challa, no!
This one's just a boy.
He got kidnapped as well.
BLACK PANTHER: Nakia...
I...
- I wanted...
- MILITANT 1: Hey!
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!
I will shoot her right now.
(GROANS)
You froze.
BLACK PANTHER: Ah...
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.
My father is dead, Nakia.
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.
And I wish for you
to be there.
NAKIA:
Carry yourselves home now.
WOMAN: Thank you.
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.
Thank you oh.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
You will speak
nothing of this day.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.

This never gets old.
(WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL

Queen Mother...
Princess...
My comfort for your loss.
RAMONDA: Thank you, Nakia.
It is so good
to have you back with us.
Take her to
the River Province
to prepare her
for the ceremony.
Yes, General.
Did he freeze?
Like an antelope
in headlights.
(LAUGHING)
Are you finished?
So surprised
my little sister came
to see me off
before our big day.
You wish!
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.
How many times
do I have to teach you?
Just because something works
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.
You are teaching me?
What do you know?
SHURI: More than you.
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...
to your ceremonial outfit.
Shuri!
Sorry, Mother!
How are you
feeling today, Mama?
Proud.
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.
He is with us...
and it is your time
to be king.
Good morning.
How can I help you?
I was just checking out
these artifacts.
They tell me
you're the expert.
Ah. You could say that.
They're beautiful.
Where's this one from?
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...
present day Ghana...
19th century.
For real?
What about this one?
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...
16th century.
Now, tell me about this one.
Also from Benin,
seventh century.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Fula tribe, I believe.
Nah.
I beg your pardon?
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin
but it's from Wakanda.
And it's made
out of vibranium.
(CHUCKLES) Don't trip.
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.
These items aren't for sale.
How do you think
your ancestors got these?
You think they paid
a fair price?
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?
Sir, I'm going to have to
(CLEARS THROAT)
ask you to leave.
You got
all this security in here
watching me
ever since I walked in.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- But you ain't checking for
- what you put in your body.
- (GASPS)
All right, mate.
Let's have it.
- Come on, mate. Time.
- (GRUNTS)
I think she might not
be feeling too good.
Somebody get some help!
Come here!
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!
GUARD: Medical emergency
right away
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.
Look out.
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.
I'm gonna take a break.
MEDIC 1: Let's give the lady
some space, please.
MEDIC 2: Step back,
please, gents.
Step back, please.
(GUARDS GRUNT)
Hey, come here.
Come here. It's okay.
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?
Because it's better to leave
the crime scene
more spread out.
Makes us look like amateurs.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Now then,
let's see if you know
what you're talking about.
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
That's just a taste.
(SNIFFING)
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.
(CHUCKLES) It's already sold!
Whatever you try,
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.
That'll make my day.
I can kill two birds
with one stone.
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

And now you want to

I am not ready.
Have you not prepared
to be king your whole life?
Have you not trained
and studied,
been by my side?
what I am talking about.
I am not ready
to be without you.
A man who has not prepared
his children
for his own death...
has failed as a father.
Have I ever failed you?
Never.
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.
I want to be
a great king, Baba.
Just like you.
You're going to struggle.
So you'll need to
surround yourself
with people you trust.
You're a good man
with a good heart.
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.
(GASPING)
Breathe.
T'Challa, breathe.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Breathe.
He was there.
(CHUCKLES)
He was there. My father.
(BEREBERE BY IDRISSA SOUMAORO

Just one?
Come home, Nakia.
I'm right here.
Stay.
I came to support you
and to honor your father...
but I can't stay.
I found my calling out there.
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.
I can't be happy here...
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?
Share what we have.
We could provide aid...
and access to technology
and refuge
to those who need it.
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.
If the world found out
what we truly are...
what we possess...
we could lose our way of life.
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others
and protect ourselves
at the same time.
(SIGHS)
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.
- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.
T'CHALLA: Is that him?
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?
W'KABI: Of course.
I see Nakia is back.
You guys going to work it out?
T'Challa...
what's wrong?
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.
More, like what?
Foreign aid, refugee programs.
You let the refugees in...
they bring their problems
with them.
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...
to go out there
and clean up the world,
then I'll be all for it.
But waging war
on other countries
has never been our way.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILLING)
You, too, huh?
Bast! We're in trouble.
My King.
My love.
You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...
in South Korea...
tomorrow night.
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.
We need a king.
My parents were killed
when he attacked.
Not a day goes by
when I do not think
about what Klaue took from us.
From me.
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.
W'KABI: Take me with you.
We'll take him down together,
side by side.
I need you here
protecting the border.
Then I ask...
you kill him
where he stands...
or you bring him back to us.
You have my word.
I will bring him back.
We will proceed
with the mission.
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
My King!
- Stop it. Stop it.
- (CHUCKLES)
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?
Okoye.
And Nakia as well.
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?
Yes.
We'll be fine.
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.
Yes!
I have great things
to show you, Brother.
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.
Unlimited range,
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.
Check these out.
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.
T'CHALLA: Ah.
And what are these?
The real question is
(SHOUTS) what are those?
(CHUCKLES)
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.
I bet the Elders loved that.
(CHUCKLES)
Try them on.
Fully automated.
Like the old American movie
Baba used to watch.
T'CHALLA: Mmm.
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.
Interesting.
Guess what I call them.
Sneakers.
Because you...
Never mind.
If you're going to take
on Klaue...
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.
Exhibit A.
T'CHALLA: My design.
SHURI: Old tech.
- Old?
- Functional, but old.
"Hey, people are shooting
at me.
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."
- Enough.
- (CHUCKLES)
Now, look at these.
Do you like that one?
Tempting.
But the idea
is to not be noticed.
This one.
(TRILLING)
Now tell it to go on.
SHURI: Ooh!
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.
Strike it.
- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not that hard, genius!
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.
I invite you to my lab,
and you just
kick things around?
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.
Hey.
Wait a minute.
SHURI: The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...
and hold it in place
for redistribution.
Very nice.
Strike it again
in the same spot.
(KIMOYO BEADS BEEP)

(IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia.
Good to see you.
Who are these two?

was she referring to?
Ah... I got into

with some ivory traders.
- Made a bit of a mess.
- Hmm.
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

Depends...
on how quickly we finish

OKOYE: Five.
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

Six.
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.
It just got
a little more complicated.
Agent Ross.
Your Highness.
You are buying from Klaue.
What I'm doing or not doing...
on behalf of
the U.S. government
is none of your concern.
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.
I gave you Zemo.
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...
that the king of
a third world country
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?
I'd say we were even.
You really need to leave, now.
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.
You've been warned.
CROUPIER: Three, craps.
Hey, you won!
You know what?
I think
I'll just take these...
bring them over here
- and hold on for safekeeping.
- ROSS: Mmm-hmm.
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.
He cannot leave with Klaue.
All right.
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia
links back to a person...
that I'm not actually saying
I'm here to make
a deal with...
but that deal
will not be called off.
When the dust settles,
you and me can work
something out.
I'm not here to make a deal.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING

(DOOR BUZZING AND BEEPING)
Klaue, plus eight!
General.
In position
to secure our exit.
And the vibranium?
I don't see it yet.
OKOYE: I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.
There's not supposed to be.
Somebody did not get the memo.
Definitely armed.
Well, that is quite
the entourage.
You got a mixtape coming out?
Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Yeah, actually, there is one.
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.
(CHUCKLES)
You think they're for you?
Don't worry.
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,
thank you very much.
OKOYE: Six more. It's a setup.
You got the diamonds?
Okay. That's enough.
- We need to move on Klaue.
- T'CHALLA: Stand down.
We can't afford a shootout.
Vibranium?
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.
It's now or never.

We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.
(TIRES SCREECH)
We're not going to make it!
BLACK PANTHER: Keep going!
Whoo! Brother!
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTS)
Hey, what was that?
BLACK PANTHER: Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.
Guns.
So primitive!
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!
The bullets won't penetrate!
What are you doing?
Just drive.
(MEN YELL)
- Whoo!
- Shit!
Hey, look at your suit.
You've been taking bullets,
charging it up
with kinetic energy.
BLACK PANTHER:
Pull around the truck.
Where'd he go?
You show-off.
There he is!
Hold tight!
(ENGINE REVS)
All right.
Let's have some fun!
(GRUNTING)
(STRAINING)
(PANTING)
Hop in.
Put that spear in the trunk.
BLACK PANTHER: Faster, Shuri.
I'm going as fast as I can!
Take a right! Take a right!
(TIRES SCREECH)
No, no, no!
(GRUNTS) Brother!
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING)
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
(GROANING AND PANTING)
BLACK PANTHER: Klaue!
Did you think we would forget?
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING)
Look at me, murderer!
Where did you get this weapon?
You savages didn't deserve it.
- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.
(IN XHOSA) King!
The world watches.
Let's go, huh?
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)
Yeah.
KLAUE: Hello.
(GIGGLES)
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.
(CACKLING)
(AIR KISSES)
(SPLUTTERING)
So this is a big mess, huh?
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes
than to make a scene here.
After your questioning,
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor
by letting you
even be in here.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
If he touches you again,
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.
Does she speak English?
When she wants to.
Huh.
I'm going in.
When I'm done,
you guys are up.
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.
You see that?
It's called diplomacy.
You're welcome.
(KLAUE SINGS WHAT IS LOVE
BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN
AND JUNIOR TORELLO)
- Okoye.
- (SCOFFS)
Play nice.
Americans.
(KLAUE CONTINUES SINGING)
(ROSS CLEARS THROAT)
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.
I'm much more your speed.
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.
Where'd you get that?
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.
But I can get you one,
if you like.
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,
and I'll ask them.
He's right outside.
Why don't you
ask him yourself?
What? T'Challa?
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?
Bingo.
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?
ROSS: Um...
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.
KLAUE: (ON EARPIECE)
It's all a front.
Explorers searched for it
for centuries.
El Dorado, the Golden City.
They thought they could
find it in South America...
but it was in Africa
the whole time.
A technological marvel.
All because it was built
on a mound
of the most valuable metal
known to man.
Isipho, they call it.
The gift.
Vibranium.
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.
It's not just a metal.
They sew it
into their clothes.
It powers their city,
their tech...
their weapons.
Weapons?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.
That's a nice fairy tale,
but Wakanda is
a third world country...
and you stole
all their vibranium.
(LAUGHING) I stole...
All of it?
I took a tiny piece of it.
They have
a mountain full of it.
They've been mining it
for thousands of years...
and they still haven't
scratched the surface.
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it
and got out of there alive.
If you don't believe me,
you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.
What his claws are made of.
(BEEPING)
Your father told the UN...
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.
But now he's telling me
you have more.
And you believe the word
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?
(TRUCK BEEPING)
(IN KOREAN) Where is that?
Back there.
How much more are you hiding?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Something is happening
out back.
(YELLS)
Get down!
- (KLAUE YELLING)
- Stand down!
MAN 1: Cover!
MAN 2: Grenade!
I see you took your time,
didn't you? (LAUGHS)
(OKOYE SPEAKING XHOSA)
My King!
My King.
Nakia.
He just jumped in front of me.
(LABORED BREATHING
AND GRUNTING)
I don't think
he'll make it here.
It hit his spine.
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)
This will stabilize him
for now.
(ROSS GRUNTING SOFTLY)
(EXHALING DEEPLY)
Give him to us.
We can save him.
OKOYE: Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.
We failed.
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?
He took a bullet for me.
OKOYE: That was his choice.
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?
Let us consider
that we heal him.
It is his duty to report back
to his country.
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.
I cannot just let him die...
knowing we can save him.
Where exactly
are we taking him?
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.
This is going to be fun.
He will live.
- (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
- (MUSIC STOPS)
W'Kabi is here.
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?
He's not here.
(SIGHS)
He slipped through our hands.
"Slipped"?
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.
With you,
I thought it'd be different.
But it's more of the same.
Let's get going, boss.
You always sell to the CIA?
I sell to the highest bidder.
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...
and I lay low for a bit,
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.
I know you good for it.
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.
You don't want to
go there, boy.
Yeah, I do.
KLAUE: Drop it!
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine
ends today.
Put your gun down now!
I'm sorry.
- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.
(KLAUE GROANS)
(GROANS)
(KLAUE PANTING)
You really want to go
to Wakanda?
They're savages.
This is what they do
to people like us.
KILLMONGER: I ain't worried
about no brand.
Check these out.
Each one is for a kill.
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.
(CHUCKLING)
T'CHALLA: Leave us!
So your mission did not go
as planned.
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?
My father told me
he disappeared.
There was a man today...
wearing a ring
identical to this one.
That is not possible.
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!
My grandfather's ring!
Do not tell me
what is possible.
Tell me the truth!
Some truths...
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.
That is not your choice
to make.
What happened to him?
I promised the king
to say nothing.
I am your king now!
Your uncle took...
a War Dog assignment
in America.
Your father...
placed me there...
to observe...
unbeknownst to him.
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.
They had a child.
The hardships he saw there...
radicalized your uncle.
I observed
for as long as I could.
Their leaders
have been assassinated.
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.
All over the planet...
our people suffer because
they don't have the tools
to fight back.
With vibranium weapons,
they could overthrow
every country...
and Wakanda could
rule them all
the right way.
He knew your father
would not support this.
So, your uncle betrayed us.
No!
He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.
No, no, no.
You will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
ZURI: He drew his weapon
on me.
- No!
- (GRUNTING)
ZURI: Your father
killed his own brother...
to save my life.
Speak nothing of this.
And the child?
We left him.
We had to...
maintain...
the lie.
What is this?
Just a little gift.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
(GRUNTING)
All right, where am I?
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!
(STAMMERS) What?
My name is Everett.
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...
former air force pilot
and now CIA.
Right.
Okay, is this Wakanda?
No, it's Kansas.
How long ago was Korea?
SHURI: Yesterday.
I don't think so.
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
They do here.
But not by magic,
by technology.
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.
ROSS: These train things...
that's magnetic levitation,
right?
Obviously.
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.
The light panels,
what are they?
- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?
In its raw form...
vibranium is too dangerous
to be transported
at that speed...
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.
ROSS: There's vibranium
on those trains?
There's vibranium
all around us.
That's how I healed you.
(CHUCKLES)
Where is T'Challa?
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.
A man showed up at the border
who claims
to have killed Klaue.
What?
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.
We need to find your brother!
An outsider?
No, a Wakandan.
He's not a Wakandan.
He's one of ours.
He killed his own brother...
and left a child behind...
with nothing.
What kind of king...
What kind of man does that?
No man is perfect.
Not even your father.
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...
he may have created something
even worse.
Hey.
Look at me.
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
Brother, you need to
get here now!
ROSS: Erik Stevens.
Graduated Annapolis age 19...
MIT for grad school.
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,
like it was a video game.
Started calling him
Killmonger.
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.
They will drop off the grid...
so they can
commit assassinations
and take down governments.
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?
SHURI: He has
a War Dog tattoo...
but we have no record of him.
Is this man Wakandan or not?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Tell us what is going on.
Speak.
I'm standing in your house...
serving justice to a man
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand
is because I know who you are.
Now, what do you want?
I want the throne.
(LAUGHS AND SPEAKS XHOSA)
My goodness.
(TRIBES' ELDERS LAUGHING)
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.
Must feel good.
It's about two billion people
all over the world
that looks like us.
But their lives
are a lot harder.
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.
And what tools are those?
Vibranium. Your weapons.
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...
for people
who are not our own.
Not your own?
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?
So ain't all people
your people?
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.
And it is my responsibility
to make sure
our people are safe...
and that vibranium
does not fall
into the hands
of a person like you.
KILLMONGER: Mmm...
RAMONDA: Son.
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.
Reject his request.
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.
An American black operative.
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.
That's not my name, Princess.
Ask me, King.
No.
Ask me.
Take him away.
(IN XHOSA) Who are you?
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.
Son of N'Jobu?
with Panther claws
in his chest!
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.
(IN XHOSA) You're lying!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.
RIVER TRIBE ELDER:
(GASPS) What?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
The descendent of N'Jobu.
I'm exercising my blood right
to challenge
for the mantles of king...
and Black Panther.
Do not do this, T'Challa.
BORDER TRIBE ELDER:
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,
he is within his rights.
He has no rights here!
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.
Weeks? I don't need weeks.
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?
I accept your challenge.
SHURI:
He'll never beat T'Challa.
He should've just come
to the first challenge
and gotten it over with.
(UPBEAT DRUMMING)
ZURI: The king
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther
stripped away.
(LABORED BREATHING)
Where is Agent Ross?
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.
This is your last chance.
Throw down your weapons,
and we can handle this
another way.
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.
I trained, I lied, I killed...
just to get here.
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...
Iraq.
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters
right here on this continent.
And all this death...
just so I could kill you.
Let the challenge begin.
- (FAST-TEMPO DRUMMING)
- (GRUNTING)
Yield!
(GROANS)
(T'CHALLA GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
Snap out of it, T'Challa!
(GRUNTING AND GROANING)
(YELLS)
(GASPS)
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
Come on, get up.
Come here.
This is for my father.
ZURI: Erik!
- Zuri, no.
- Stop!
- Zuri!
- Zuri, don't!
I am the cause of
your father's death.
Not him.
Take me.
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.
No!
No! No!
Zuri, no!
(GROANS)
No!
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!
No! No!
(YELLING)
Is this your king? Huh?
(T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
Is this your king?
The Black Panther,
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?
Come on, Brother!
Is there nothing
that can be done?
- (T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
- Him?
He's supposed to protect you?
- No.
- No!
No!
Nah. I'm your king.
- No! No!
- We have to go now!
Queen Mother, let's go!
(RAMONDA CRYING)
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?
- Yes.
- (SIGHS)
(IN XHOSA) Thank you.
to them immediately.
(IN XHOSA) I cannot.
Though my heart is with you.
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man
who showed up here
only hours ago.
He is of royal blood.
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.
Does that really matter?
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.
Overthrow?
Nakia!
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.
What are you loyal to?
I loved him.
I loved my country, too.
Then you serve your country.
No. I save my country.
What's wrong?
The king is dead.
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.
First Baba.
And now my brother.
(CRYING) Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.
(RAMONDA SIGHS)
- (WHISPERS) It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.
Where's Okoye?
Okoye is not coming.
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.
Wait here.
What has happened
to our Wakanda?
(CHANTING SOFTLY)
SHAMAN:
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.
(SOBBING QUIETLY)
N'JOBU: What did I tell you
about going into my things?
Hmm?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
What did you find?
Your home.
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.
Yes. The sunsets there
are the most beautiful
in the world.
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.
Why?
They will say you are lost.
But I'm right here.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
No tears for me?
Everybody dies.
It's just life around here.
Well, look at what
I have done.
I should've taken you back
long ago.
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.
That's why they can't find us.
(GASPING)
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?
This all of it?
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,
we will be ready.
Another king?
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...
(CHOKING)
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.
(YELPS)
(BOTH GASP)
Burn it all!
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
You know, where I'm from...
when black folks
started revolutions,
they never had
the firepower...
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.
Where was Wakanda?
Hmm?
Yeah, all that ends today.
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.
Already in place.
I know how colonizers think.
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.
And their children.
And anyone else
who takes their side.
It's time they know
the truth about us!
We're warriors!
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.
OKOYE: Wakanda has survived
for so long...
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.
But the world is changing,
General.
Elders, it is getting smaller.
The outside world
is catching up...
and soon it will be
the conquerors
or the conquered.
I'd rather be the former.
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.
ROSS: So where are we
going again?
NAKIA: We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb
to Jabariland.
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.
Nakia.
I don't like this.
The Herb belongs to us.
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.
I am a spy with no army.
I wouldn't stand a chance.
(SIGHS)
We'll go.
Oh, boy.
(SHUSHES)
(MEN CHANTING AND GRUNTING)
ROSS: Oh, shit.
Look down. Stay calm.
Shuri.
Look down.
My son...
was murdered in ritual combat.
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...
(GRUNTS)
- The new king...
- (MEN GRUNTING)
M'BAKU: You cannot talk!
One more word,
and I will feed you
to my children.
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.
(LAUGHING)
NAKIA: Great Gorilla M'Baku...
this is why we are here.
To offer this to you.
An outsider
sits on our throne.
Only you can help us stop him.
Come with me.
- (GASPS)
- Impossible!
(RAMONDA GASPING)
Is he breathing?
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.
One of our fishermen found him
at the edge
of the river border.
He brought him to me.
Why do you have him
in the snow?
It is the only thing
keeping him
from joining the ancestors.
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.
Nakia, the Herb.
I call upon the ancestors.
I call upon Bast.
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.
Heal him.
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!
Okay.
(IN XHOSA)
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Wake up, T'Challa.
Wake up.
(T'CHAKA SPEAKS XHOSA)
My son.
for you to come home...
and be reunited with me.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Why?
bring the boy home?
Why, Baba?
He...
He was the truth
I chose to omit.
You were wrong to abandon him.
I chose my people.
I chose Wakanda.
Our future depended...
You were wrong!
All of you were wrong!
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!
We let the fear
of our discovery
stop us from doing
what is right!
No more!
I cannot stay here with you.
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.
He is a monster
of our own making.
I must take the mantle back.
I must!
I must right these wrongs.
- (T'CHALLA GASPS)
- (RAMONDA EXCLAIMING)
(SHIVERING)
Do you have a blanket?
NAKIA: Killmonger
has the full support
of our military.
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.
ROSS: Of course he did.
That's what he was
trained to do.
His unit used to work
with the CIA
to destabilize
foreign countries.
They would always strike
at transitions of power...
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.
You get control of government,
the military...
- Our resources.
- ROSS: Right.
The Great Mound.
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.
He will send our weapons
all over the world.
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.
- What?
- What about you?
The challenge
will have to continue.
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.
It is my duty
to keep you safe.
If he gets control
of our technology,
nowhere will be safe.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
The Black Panther lives.
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...
I will be right there
beside him.
As will I.
ROSS: I'm in, too.
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.
(M'BAKU YAWNS LOUDLY)
Are you done?
(STAMMERS) Are you done?
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
I owed you a great debt.
A life for a life.
Consider it paid.
Please allow my mother
to stay here.
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.
You know, I could use
an army as well.
I bet you could. (LAUGHS)
But no.
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.
It is our cause.
- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...
and now you speak of "us"?
I cannot speak for past kings.
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.
We both know the power
of vibranium.
If Killmonger
gains control of it,
who do you think
he will come for next?
We will not help you.
(SIGHS)
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
W'KABI:
Everything is on schedule.
Have the spies been alerted?
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.
But the War Dogs in London,
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.
We'll strike there first.
The others'll come around.
Look at this.
A handheld sonic cannon,
powerful enough
to stop a tank...
untraceable by
metal detectors.
And we got thousands of them.
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.
(EXPLOSION)
He lives.
N'Jadaka!

Don't worry,

It's just like riding

Nah, I learn from my enemies.

You will destroy the world,

My name is King T'Challa...
son of King T'Chaka.
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.
And for the first time
in our history...
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...
with the outside world.
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.
We cannot.
We must not.
We will work to be an example
of how we...
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...
should treat each other.
Now, more than ever...
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.
We all know the truth.
More connects us
than separates us.
But in times of crisis...
the wise build bridges...
while the foolish
build barriers.
We must find a way...
to look after one another...
as if we were one,
single tribe.
With all due respect,
King T'Challa...
what can a nation of farmers
have to offer
the rest of the world?

Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.
Bucky.
How are you feeling?
Good.
Thank you.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Come.
Much more for you to learn.
Who am I? You sure you want to know?
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...
... if somebody told you I was just an
average ordinary guy, not a care in the world...
... somebody lied.
But let me assure you, this
like any story worth telling...
... is all about a girl.
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.
The woman I've loved
since before I even liked girls.
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.
Hey! Stop the bus!
That's me.
Tell him to stop! Please!
Stop!
Hey! Stop the bus!
Stop the bus! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven Blvd.
Catch a cab, Parker!
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
What a geek!
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.
Would you date him?
Midtown High seniors.
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.
So behave accordingly.
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.
Come on, stay together.
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.
- Dad would you ask Hoskins to drive around the corner please.
- Why?
The entrance is right there.
Dad these are public school kids,
I'm not showing up for the field trip in a Rolls.
You want me to trade in my care for a Jetta
just because you flunked out of every private school I ever sent you to?
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.
It's just...
Just what, Harry?
Forget it.
Pete!
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Harry! Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks Dad.
- Um, Peter may I introduce my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.
- It's a great honour to meet you sir.
- Harry tells me you're quite the science whiz.
Y'know, I'm something of a scientist myself.
I read all your research on nanotechnology.
Really Brilliant.
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.
- I live with my aunt and uncle, they are proud.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.
I think he wants to adopt you.
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.
That's amazing!
This is the most advanced electron
microscope in the eastern seaboard.
It's unreal.
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...
...varying strengths which help them
in their constant search for food.
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.
For the school paper?
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...
...genus Kukulcania.
It spins an intricate funnel shaped web whose strands
have a tensile strength
...proportionately equal to the type of high tension wire...
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?
Or his father will fire your father.
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?
What is going on?
The next person who talks
will fail this course. I kid you not.
- This grass spider...
- Let's go.
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...
...that some researchers believe
it almost borders on precognition.
-Those guys are jerks.
-...an imminent awareness of danger...
A spider-sense.
Hey, look at that spider.
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.
It's a defense mechanism.
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?
Who wouldn't?
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's genetic research facility has...
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.
I love them!
Yeah, me too.
You know, spiders can change
their color...
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.
...transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...
...combining the genetic
information from all three...
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.
There's 14.
I beg your pardon?
- One's missing.
- Yeah.
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the eastern seaboard?
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.
Let's talk about how we listen.
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...
...but at Midtown High...
Hey, Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.
- Sure, yeah.
- Great.
Where do you want me?
Over here?
Yeah, that's great.
Don't make me look ugly.
That's impossible.
Perfect.
- Is that good?
- Great.
That's great.
M.J., let's go!
Wait. Thanks!
Parker, let's do it.
We've solved the horizon glide
and the multi-G balance issues.
I've already seen the glider.
That's not what I'm here for.
General Slocum, good to see you again.
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors pay us a little visit.
I want to see the progress report on
Human performance enhancers.
We tried vapour inhalation with rodent subjects.
They showed an 800 percent increase in strength.
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?
-In one trial yes.
-It was an aberration.
All the tests since
have been successful.
In the trial that went wrong, what happen?
what were the side effects?
Violence, aggression...
...and insanity.
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.
With the exception of Dr. Strom our entire staff
certifies the product
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.
I'm going to be frank with you.
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.
Norman, the General gave the go-ahead
to request aerospace
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton design.
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your so-called performance enhancers
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.
Gentlemen. Ladies.
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voil! There is light.
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.
I'm already on my ass, May.
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.
Hand me that dish. The green one.
The corporation is downsizing
the people...
...and upsizing their profits.
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?
Computer...
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.
I love you. And Peter loves you.
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.
How you doing? How was the field trip?
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.
- You won't have a bite?
- No thanks, had a bite.
Did you get some pictures, Peter?
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
What's that all about?
In this recombination lab...
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...
...combining the genetic
information from all three...
... into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.
The data just doesn't justify
this test.
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.
Don't be a coward.
Risks are part of laboratory science.
Let me reschedule,
with the proper medical staff and a volunteer.
- If you just give me two weeks...
- Two weeks?
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.
Oh, that's cold.
Norman?
Norman!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Norman!
Back to formula?
Weird.
- Peter?
- Yeah?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?
Yep. Big change.
- Well, hurry up. You're going to be late.
- Right.
Okay.
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.
- I got better.
- See?
- Bye, guys.
- You haven't eaten anything, have you got your lunch money?
- Yeah I've got it.
Hey Michaelangelo don't forget
we're painting the kitchen right after school. Got it?
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.
And don't start up with me.
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.
You're trash!
You're always going to be trash just like her.
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?
Hi, M.J.
Hey, M.J.
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?
I got the car. Hop in.
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.
Or not.
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!
Tell him to stop.
- Check him out!
- Dork!
Dad!
Dad, are you all right?
Harry.
What are you doing on the floor?
I don't know.
Have you been there all night?
Last night I was...
What?
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?
Sir, I asked her to wait in the foyer.
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.
What?
They found his body this morning
in the lab. He's been murdered, sir.
- What are you talking about?
- And the flight suit and the glider...
- What about it?
- It's been stolen, sir.
Wow! Great reflexes!
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.
You just get contacts?
Well, see you.
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.
Did you see that?
Parker?
- It's a fight!
- Think you're pretty funny don't you, freak?
- Flash it was just an accident.
-My fist breaking your teeth is the accident.
-C'mon Flash, stop.
-I don't want to fight you Flash.
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.
Help him, Harry.
How'd he do that?
Which one?
He's all yours, man.
Flash, get up!
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.
That was amazing.
I'm out of here. Come on.
Go, web!
Fly.
Up, up and away, web.
Shazam!
Go! Go!
Go, web, go!
Tallyho.
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?
Bring me some beer.
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!
You're as stupid as your mother.
Where's she going?
Where you going?
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!
- Were you listening to that?
- No.
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.
I guess you can always hear us.
Everybody shouts.
Your aunt and uncle don't.
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...
You really freaked us out.
I'm sorry. Is he okay?
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.
So where are you going
after you graduate?
I wanna move into the city.
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.
Work my way through college.
What about you?
Headed for the city too.
Can't wait to get out of here.
I wanna...
What?
No, come on. Try me.
I wanna...
...act...
...on-stage.
Really?
Oh, that's perfect.
You were awesome
in all the school plays.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.
Peter, that was first grade.
Well...
...even so.
Sometimes...
...you know people.
You can just see what's coming.
What do you see coming for you?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.
And what for me?
For you?
You're gonna light up Broadway.
You know...
...you're taller than you look.
I hunch.
Don't.
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.
Come on.
I gotta go.
Bye.
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.
- Look at it!
- Hop in.
Oh, my God. What a cool car!
Pretty tight, huh?
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.
Cool car.
What's going on in there?
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.
Okay. Thanks.
Something's bothering him.
Maybe he's too embarrased to tell me what it is.
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.
I don't know, I just don't know anymore.
I'm going to the downtown library,
I'll see you later.
- Wait. I'll drive you there, buddy.
- I'll take the train.
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go, go.
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Now wait a minute, we need to talk.
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?
Because we haven't talked at all for so long,
your Aunt May and I don't even know who you are any more.
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.
- You start fights at school.
- I didn't start that fight, I told you that.
- Well you sure as hell finished it.
- What was I supposed to do, run away?
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...
But, Pete look, you're changing. I know,
I went through exactly the same thing at your age.
No. Not exactly.
Peter... these are the years
when a man changes...
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.
Just be careful who you change into.
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.
But just because you can
beat him up...
...doesn't give you the right to.
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.
Are you afraid that I'm going to turn into some
kind of criminal? Quit worrying about me, okay?
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing, please.
I don't mean to lecture and I don't mean to
preach. And I know I'm not your father--
Then stop pretending to be!
Right.
I'll pick you up here at 1 0.

- I don't care, get out there.
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out, little man.
I hope you brought your mommy.
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my legs!
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Cage! Cage! Cage!
Cage!
Hello? Guys?
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?
Hey listen! This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!
Hey, freak show!
You're going nowhere.
I got you for three minutes.
Three minutes of playtime.
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?
Finish him off!
Smash him!
- Hit him!
- Harder!
Kick his spider ass!
Hit him!
One, two, three!
That's it! That's it!
Winner!
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spiderman!
Now get out of here.
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.
Well, check it again, webhead.
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.
I need that money.
I missed the part
where that's my problem.
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.
Hurry up!
Hey! He stole the gate!
Stop that guy!
Stop him! He's got my money!
Thanks.
What the hell's the matter with you,
you let him go!
Cut him off and call the cops!
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he's going to get away with my money.
I missed the part
where that's my problem.
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?
Old dude, man.
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.
Uncle Ben?
Uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben?
Peter.
I'm here, Uncle Ben.
Peter.
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.
Get a unit to the rear!
I got the back!
Who's there?
Don't hurt me. Just give me a chance.
Just give me a chance!
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?
Answer me!
Stop that guy!
Thanks.
See you.
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.
Oh, no. My God.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, General Slocum.
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
- He's clear! Go!
- I assume you're confident about this test.
Absolutely, Captain Curtis is our top pilot.
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?
Nothing would please me more
than to put Norman Osborn out of business.
Preflight complete. Mark.
We are picking up an
unidentified object closing fast.
What the hell is that?
Can you see anything?
Oh, my God!
- Say "chess."
- Chess!
Peter!
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.
Pete. Good news. My Father got the place in
New York so we're all set this Friday.
- Oh that's great!
- You made it.
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.
Yeah.
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.
Commencement:
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.
You know what? Whatever.
Your loss.
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.
And if you ever need anything,
just give me a call.
Can I fix you something?
No, thanks.
I missed him a lot today.
I know.
I miss him too.
But he was there.
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.
You loved him...
...and he loved you.
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.
How you were meant for great things.
You won't disappoint him.
With great power
comes great responsibility.
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.
Hurry up!
This is not a man. My brother saw him building a
nest in the Lincoln Center fountain.
They think he's human.
They think he's a man. Could be a woman.
Bobby. Get a load of this!
He throws up his hands, ropes come out, and
he climbs up the ropes like a spider web.
I see the web and it's a signature,
and I know Spiderman was here.
The guy protects us, you know
protects the people.
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
Wakadoo.
He stinks and I don't like him.
Don't move, lady!
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.
Those tights and that tight little...
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug
But we should all just give him
One big hug
Look out
Here comes the Spiderman
"Who is Spiderman?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?
Mr. Jameson your wife is on line one
she needs to know if--
- Mr. Jameson there's a page six problem.
-We have a page one problem, shut up.
- Well?
- He's news.
- These are really important clients they can't wait.
- They're about to.
- He pulled six people off that subway car.
- Sure from a wreck he probably caused.
Something goes wrong and this creepy-crawler is there.
Look at that, he's fleeing the scene. What's that tell you?
He's not fleeing, he's probably going to
save somebody else. He's a hero!
Then why's he wear a mask, hmm?
What's he got to hide?
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille in the dining room.
- Whichever's cheaper.
- Mr. Jameson it's like this,
We double-booked page six. See so both
Macy's and Conway's have three-quarters of the same page.
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?
Every copy.
Tomorrow morning. Spiderman. Page one with a decent
picture this time. Move Conway to page seven.
- That's a problem.
- Make it page eight and give 'em 10 percent off.
No make it 5 percent.
- That can't be done.
- Get outta here!
Problem is we don't have a decent picture.
Eddie's been on it for weeks, we can barely get a glimpse of him.
Aw, what is he, shy?
We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong
we can certainly get a picture of this weirdo.
Put an ad on the front page.
"Cash money for a picture of Spiderman"
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!
Buzz off.
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm begging for a job. How about you?
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting now?
Yeah.
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.
That's great MJ.
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Hey counter girl!
Your drawer was short six dollars!
Next time that happens,
I'm gonna take it outta your cheque!
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
It better not happen no more, hear me?.
Don't roll your eyes at me.
Some dream, huh?
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
Oh, yeah. Right.
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.
No, I guess not.
Thanks, Pete.
We should catch up sometime.
Let's get some lunch some evening.
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.
- And I won't tell Harry.
- No, don't tell Harry.
I won't.
I won't tell Harry.
Timing's perfect. Hey.
Five new contracts. It'll be great.
Stormin' Norman's making his weekly inspection.
Spent half of it on the phone.
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.
Are you all right?
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.
You were late again?
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?
Around.
Peter Parker.
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who's that?
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.
- When do I get to meet her?
- Dad!
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?
Dad, maybe you can help him out.
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- It's no problem. I'll make a few calls.
I couldn't accept it. I'd like to earn
what I get. I can find my own work.
I respect that.
You want to make it on your own steam.
That's great.
What other skills do you have Parker?
I was thinking of something in photography.
Hello.
Let's go! Move it!
Watch the street!
Cheese!
They're crap.
Crap, crap. Megacrap.
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.
Take them somewhere else then.
- Sir your wife said that tile you want in the foyer is out of stock.
- Tell her we'll just put a rug there.
Sit down. Give me that.
I'll give you 300.
That's a standard freelance fee.
- Tear up page one. Run that photo instead.
- Headline?
"Spiderman, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Daily Bugle Photos."
- Menace? He was protecting that--
- Tell you what, Atticus you take the pictures
I'll make up the headlines, ok? all right?
That ok with you.
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.
Best thing in the world for a kid your age.
Bring me some more shots of that newspaper selling clown,
maybe I'll take 'em off your hands.
But I never said you have a job. Meat.
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Best I can do. Get outta here.
Bring me more photos.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.
- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.
I'm Peter Parker.
I'm a photographer.
Yes. I can see that.
As of today...
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...
...costs are down, revenues are up...
...and our stock
has never been higher.
Wonderful news, Norman. Woderful.
In fact, it's the reason for selling the company.
What?
Yes, Quest Aerospace is recapitalizing
in the wake of the bombing. Expanding.
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.
Why wasn't I told?
The last thing they want is a power struggle
with entrenched management.
The deal is off if you come with it.
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.
You can't do this to me.
I started this company.
You know how much I sacrificed?!
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.
I'm sorry.
You're out, Norman.
Am I?
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.
I think you're beautiful.
MJ would you do me a favour?
I forgot my drink inside.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.
- Have you seen my father around?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming today.
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.
What is that?
That's our glider!
What the hell was that?
Code three! Code three!
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!
Harry! Help me! Harry!
Out, am I?
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!
Hello, my dear.
It's Spiderman!
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!
Somebody help him!
No!
Mommy!
- Hold it right there!
- I surrender.
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!
Impressive.
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!
Hold on!
Watch out!
We'll meet again, Spiderman!
Hold on Mary Jane!
Well, beats taking the subway.
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.
Wait.
Who are you?
- You know who I am.
- I do?
Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'm going to come over.
No, I'm gonna come...
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?
And we'll go and have breakfast and...
...I want to buy you something.
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs...
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.
You're right.
I didn't.
I'm gonna get some rest.
I'm gonna stay up for a while.
What was that thing?
I don't know.
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.
Somebody there?
Somebody.
Somebody.
Who said that?
Don't play the innocent with me.
You've known all along.
Where are you?
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.
I'm right here.
I don't understand.
Did you think it was coincidence?
So many good things,
all happening for you.
All for you. Norman.
What do you want?
To say what you won't.
To do what you can't.
To remove those in your way.
The board members.
You killed them.
We killed them.
We?
Remember?
Your little accident
in the laboratory.
The performance enhancers.
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:
Power beyond your wildest dreams.
And it's only the beginning.
There's only one who can stop us.
Or imagine if he joined us.
Spiderman. And the Green Goblin.
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.
- These weirdo's all gotta have a name now.
- Mr. Jameson Spiderman...
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?
Call the patent office, copyright the name Green Goblin,
I want a quarter every time somebody says it.
How about "Green Meanie"?
Spiderman wasn't attacking the city he was
trying to save it. That's slander.
It is not. I resent that.
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.
You don't trust anybody, that's your problem.
I trust my barber.
What are you his lawyer? Get out of here!
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...
Jameson, you slime.
Who's the photographer who takes the
pictures of Spiderman?
- I don't know who he is. His stuff comes in the mail.
- Liar!
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.
Set him down, tough guy.
- Speak of the devil.
- Spiderman! I knew you two were in this together.
Hey, kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute, will you?.
Sleep...
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.
No, you're not dead yet.
Just paralyzed...
...temporarily.
You're an amazing creature,
Spiderman.
You and I are not so different.
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.
Well, to each his own.
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.
Why bother?
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.
There are eight million people
in this city.
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.
You, me...
...we're exceptional.
I could squash you like a bug
right now.
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.
What we could create.
Or we could destroy.
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?
Think about it, hero.
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.
It's me again.
How was your audition?
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...
...told my aunt, told me.
So you just came by?
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...
So how'd it go?
They said I needed acting lessons.
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.
I'd like a cheeseburger.
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.
Come with us.
No, thanks. How's it going with...?
Never mind.
That's none of my business.
It's not?
Why so interested?
I'm not.
You're not?
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.
Why would you be?
I, that's a...
I don't know.
Sorry you won't come with us.
I'd better run, tiger.
Hey, check it out, man.
Come on, man.
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!
Get off me!
Wait!
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.
I was in the neighborhood.
You are amazing.
Some people don't think so.
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.
Do I get to say thank you this time?
Wait.
I have to get in there! My baby's in there!
My baby's in there!
- Let me go!
- I can't let you in there, the roof's about to collapse.
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!
Look! Up there!
Save my baby, please!
No!
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!
God bless you, Spiderman.
Bless you.
Don't let him get away!
Hold it right there! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!
I'm going.
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back chief.
Go! Go!
Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out of here!
It's okay.
You're pathetically predictable.
Like a moth to the flame.
What about my generous proposal?
Are you in or are you out?
- It's you who's out Gobby. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.
Oh, great.
No one says no to me!
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.
He's here.
Are you ready?
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.
Who is this lovely young lady?
I'd like you to meet my father Norman Osborn.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
How do you do?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.
Peter?
Is that you?
How strange. There's nobody here.
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!
Sorry I'm late.
It's a jungle out there.
I had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...
...and we can say grace.
Here we go.
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.
Will you do the honors?
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
Oh, yeah, I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.
Well, let me see.
Oh, my goodness.
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving in this apartment
and we are going to do things properly.
How did you say that happened?
Bike messenger.
Knocked me down.
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to be going.
- Why?
Something has come to my attention.
Are you all right?
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!
Dad, what are you doing?
I plan this whole thing so you can meet MJ
and now you've got to leave?
I've got to go.
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.
Do you think a woman like that is sniffing
around because she likes your personality?
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful too.
They're all beautiful until they're snarling after
your trust fund like a pack of ravening wolves.
You're wrong about her Dad.
A word to the not so wise about your little girlfriend,
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.
That creep is my father, all right
If I'm lucky I'll become half of what he is
so just keep your mouth shut
about stuff you don't understand.
Harry Osborn!
I'm sorry, Aunt May.
Spiderman is all but invincible.
But Parker, we can destroy him.
I can't.
Betrayal must not be countenanced.
Parker must be educated.
What do I do?
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.
Yes?
And then grant his wish.
But how?
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.
Tell me how!
The heart, Osborn.
First, we attack his heart.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...
Deliver us!
Finish it!
- Finish it!
- From evil!
Two milligrams IV.
Get the BP.
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?
Yes she's going to be ok.
Look you're going to have to leave right now.
- What happened?
- Those eyes!
Those horrible yellow eyes!
He knows who I am.
I'm sorry.
- Will she be okay?
- She's going to be fine.
She's been sleeping all day.
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.
How are you?
You okay about the other night?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.
I haven't called him back.
The fact is...
...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?
At least I think I am.
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.
Would I know his name, this guy?
You'll think I'm a stupid little
girl with a crush.
Trust me.
It's funny.
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say about him?
No, no, not Spiderman,
not a chance in the world.
I know him a little bit.
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.
What'd he say?
I said...
He asked me what I thought about you.
And what did you say?
I said, "Spiderman."
I said, "The great thing about M. J...
...is...
...when you look in her eyes...
...and she's looking back in yours...
...everything feels...
...not quite normal.
Because you feel...
...stronger...
...and weaker at the same time.
You feel excited...
...and at the same time...
...terrified.
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.
It's as if you've...
...reached the unreachable...
...and you weren't ready for it."
You said that?
Well, something like that.
Dad?
Dad, is that you?
What is it?
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.
She's in love with Peter.
- Parker?
- Yeah.
And how does he feel about her?
He's loved her since the 4th grade.
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.
I'm so sorry.
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.
That's no excuse.
I'm proud of you.
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you, Harry.
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.
Wake up, little spider.
Wake up.
Go home, dear.
You look awful.
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.
A smile. Finally.
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.
Hey, you were supposed to be asleep.
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J. 's family moved in next door.
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, aunt May, is that an angel?"
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.
Well, Harry's in love with her.
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.
You're so mysterious all the time.
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?
Everybody else knows.
I'll be right back.
But...
Come on, pick up.
- Hey M.J.
-Hi. Sing your song at the beep.
M.J., it's Peter. You there?
Hello? You there?
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?
All right, well...
Don't...
Don't go up any dark alleys.
Hello?
Can Spiderman come out to play?
Where is she?
- What is that?
- That's cool!
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out
Goblin, what have you done?
Spiderman!
This is why only fools are heroes.
Because you never know...
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:
Let die the woman you love...
...or suffer the little children.
- Spiderman!
- Save us!
Save us!
Make your choice, Spiderman...
...and see how a hero is rewarded.
Don't do it, Goblin!
We are who we choose to be.
- Now, choose!
- No!
Everybody stay still!
Ahoy up there!
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!
M.J., you can do it. You have to.
Trust me.
Hold on tight and go quickly.
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.
Hang on, Mary Jane!
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!
It's time to die.
Come on up here dumb gu
I got a little something for ya.
Leave Spiderman alone.
You gonna pick on a guy trying to save a bunch of kids?
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!
Spiderman, watch out!
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.
I offered you friendship...
...and you spat in my face.
You've spun your last web, Spiderman.
Had you not been so selfish, your little
girlfriend's death
...would have been quick and painless.
But now that you've really
pissed me off...
...l'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.
M.J. and I...
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.
Peter, stop!
Stop! It's me.
Mr. Osborn.
Peter, thank God for you.
You killed those people
on that balcony.
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!
Don't let him take me again.
I beg you. Protect me.
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.
But not you.
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.
I would never hurt you.
I knew from the beginning...
...if anything ever happened to me...
...it was you I could count on.
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.
Thank God for you.
Give me your hand.
Believe in me
as I believed in you.
I've been like a father to you.
Be a son to me now.
I have a father.
His name was Ben Parker.
Godspeed, Spiderman.
Peter.
Don't tell Harry.
What have you done?
What have you done?!
I'm so sorry, Harry.
I know what it's like
to lose a father.
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.
One day Spiderman will pay.
I swear on my father's grave,
Spiderman will pay.
Thank God for you, Peter.
You're the only family I have.
No matter what I do...
... no matter how hard I try...
... the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.
You must miss him so much.
It's been so hard without him.
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.
When I was up there...
...and I thought I was gonna die...
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
It was you, Pete.
I kept thinking:
"I hope I make it through this...
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."
Really?
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...
...who makes me feel...
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.
That I'm just...
...me.
And that's okay.
The truth is...
...I love you.
I love you so much, Peter.
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.
I can't...
You can't what?
Tell you...
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.
Yeah. There's so much to tell.
I want you to know...
...that I will always be there
for you.
I will always be there
to take care of you.
I promise you that.
I will always be your friend.
Only a friend...
...Peter Parker?
That's all I have to give.
Whatever life holds in store for me...
I will never forget these words,
"With great power
comes great responsibility. "
This is my gift.
My curse.
Who am I?
I'm Spiderman.

She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.
Parker. Parker!
No, no, no, stop! Stop!
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep- dish pizzas.
I told you,
I don't understand that language.
- Speak English.
- You can't make pizza.
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.
- Why didn't you send Saleem?
- Saleem was deported yesterday.
- Look... Smiley.
- What about my cheese pizza?
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7,5 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
Hey, what, are you stupid?
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.
Yes, Mr. Spider- Man.
See you.
Way to go, Spidey!
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
Elevator.
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.
You're fired.
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
- Boss.
- Not now.
The Bugle could show another side
of New York for a change.
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho
Spider- Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take
any more pictures.
You turned the whole city
against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
- It's your wife, she lost her chequebook.
- Thanks for the good news.
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.
All right, Mr. Jameson.
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."
I told you, he's not a menace.
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.
That's outrageous.
Done. Give this to the girl.
Thank you. Bye- bye.
Hi.
Hey, Pete.
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.
- Right.
- Sorry.
Hey.
Chin up, okay?
Watch it, jerk!
Dr. Connors. Sorry.
Where were you headed, Parker?
To your class.
My class is over.
See me standing here?
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.
Then be here.
Look at you, Peter.
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.
You always appear exhausted.
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.
Planning is not a major
at this university.
Octavius is a friend of mine.
Better do your research, Parker.
Get it done, or I'm failing you.
Surprise!
Well, say something.
What's the occasion?
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!
Whether you want
to remember it or not.
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Long time, no see.
So how's the play?
I read a great review.
It's going fine. It's going good.
She's brilliant in it.
Harry sent me roses.
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider- Man?
How's the bug these days?
The less you see of that man,
the better.
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.
Thank you.
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.
M.J., could you give me a hand?
She's waiting for you, pal.
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
Why, are you dead?
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
Could we get off that subject?
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?
Peter, don't you understand
how I feel?
I want this guy dead.
The same way you want the guy
who killed your Uncle Ben dead.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
rag on you on your birthday.
You're my buddy, you know that.
You're family, Pete.
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.
Thank you, Harry.
May.
Oh, what, Ben?
Wait.
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.
Everybody's gone, aren't they?
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
Oh, my. You did?
Oh, well.
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!
You can take this money from me.
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!
And don't you dare leave it here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?
I think to myself at times...
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.
Now...
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey. You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.
The photographer liked my face.
I was only supposed to be
in the catalogue.
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.
Your dream came true.
How about yours?
I'm fine.
I wish you'd come see the play.
You're the one who
always encouraged me.
I plan to.
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.
Oh, boy, yeah.
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was...
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
What?
Happy birthday.
I'm seeing somebody now.
- Therapy.
- No.
A person, a man.
You mean, like a boyfriend?
Well, like I like him.
What?
Nothing.
That's good, you know?
Companionship...
May be more than that.
More?
I don't know.
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.
Don't disappoint me.
I won't.
Rent.
- Hi.
- Hi. What's " hi"?
Can I spend it?
I have a paycheque due this week
and...
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.
Hello?
Rent?
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.
It's not about the prizes, Harry.
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.
Who do we have here?
This is my good friend
I called you about.
He got me through
high-school science.
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...
I know what you're doing here...
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!
Interesting fellow, your friend.
I won't take much of your time.
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.
He also tells me you're lazy.
I'm trying to do better.
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.
And you use it
for the good of mankind.
Otto, your lunch is ready.
- This is my wife, Rosie.
- Hello.
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.
I always fell asleep in physics class.
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- Good to meet you.
Excuse me.
Is that it?
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.
Sympathetic frequencies.
Harmonic reinforcement?
Go on.
An exponential increase
in energy output.
A huge amount of energy.
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.
It's all so amazing. If it works,
it could change the way we live.
It is amazing, and it will work.
Are you sure you could stabilise
the fusion reaction?
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?
This is my life's work.
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.
You can sleep soundly tonight.
Otto's done his homework.
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the 5th?
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?
Rosie, I love this boy.
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well...
I don't really know.
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.
Love should never be a secret.
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...
...gonna make you sick.
I finally got lucky in love.
We both did.
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.
Time present and time past
- Are both perhaps present
- Perhaps present
- In time future
- In time future
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.
Poetry.
Never fails.
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie
Brightest green were all her garments
And her hair was lik e the sunshine
Day by day he gazed upon her
Rent!
Where is my money?!
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
Work out, plenty of rest.
You know, eat your green vegetables.
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on. Go.
Keep it steady.
It's a web.
Go, Spidey, go!
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should
forgive them?
Yes.
I mean, no.
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.
It helps maintain the illusion.
I understand.
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.
But not to come late.
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...
Listen, can't you...?
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man
A-does whatever a spider can
A-spins a web, any size
Catches thieves a-just lik e flies
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?
Yeah, I'm sure.
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?
What are you doing here?
You hungry?
Starved.
What was that?
Okay.
How you doing?
Good.
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.
- Think it's great.
- Thanks.
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols & Knudsen...
...PR firm in the building...
...and I just wanna say I think
the image you have is fantastic.
It's really put together.
The costume. The... this thing.
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.
I think you could do more
than print though.
I think you might wanna try some TV,
you know?
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?
How about a children's book?
You could...
Like Charlotte's Web,
but without the pig. That kind of thing.
How about a line of hammocks?
Because it's kind of a web thing.
You could do a men's cologne
called Thwip.
Let me give you a card.
I don't have any pockets.
Yeah.
Well, we're right in the building.
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.
- Slow elevator.
- Yeah.
Thus, the second-order term...
...in the expansion of
the exact order...
...is identical to the second order...
...calculated from first-order
perturbation energy.
Since we are free to choose
an arbitrary origin for our energy...
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.
Hi, M.J..
This is Peter.
I was on my way to your show and...
Well, I was on my bike...
Are you there?
I really was planning on it all day.
And...
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.
Bingo.
It's amazing, isn't it?
How complicated a simple thing...
...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.
Your time has expired.
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.
I wanna tell you the truth.
Here it is.
I'm Spider- Man.
Weird, huh?
Now you know
why I can't be with you.
If my enemies found out about you...
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.
But first, before we start...
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?
Because we found the rubber band.
It's a terrible joke.
But thank you for coming.
Today...
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.
And now let me introduce
my assistants.
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...
...is as advanced as you suggest...
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?
How right you are.
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...
...to protect
my higher brain function.
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.
And now on to the main event.
Give me the blue light, Rosie.
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...fasten your seat belts.
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.
Thank you.
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.
The power of the sun...
...in the palm of my hand.
Keep calm! It's only a spike!
It'll soon stabilise!
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.
We have a containment breach!
Otto, please get back!
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!
It will stabilise! It's under control!
I'm in charge here!
It's my money! I'm in con...
This doesn't change anything.
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.
No!
Rosie!
Watch it.
That was too close.
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.
I'm ruined.
I have nothing left,
except Spider- Man.
He saved your life, sir.
He humiliated me by touching me.
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.
What was he doing here anyway?
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.
We're ready, doctor.
Anybody here take shop class?
No! No! No!
Help me! Help me!
No!
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumours.
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?
Hoffman!
What are we gonna call this guy?
- "Dr. Octopus".
- That's crap.
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!
- "Dr. Strange".
- That's pretty good.
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus".
- I like it.
- Of course you do.
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
" Doc Ock".
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?
Get out.
Chief, I found Parker.
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!
I heard Spider- Man was there.
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.
Chief, the planetarium party.
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.
What do you know
about high society?
- Oh. Well, I...
- Don't answer that.
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.
Could you pay me in advance?
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.
My Rosie's dead.
My dream is dead.
And these...
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...
...along with me.
Something...
...in my head.
Something talking.
The inhibitor chip!
Gone.
Rebuild.
No.
Peter was right.
I miscalculated.
I couldn't have miscalculated.
It was working, wasn't it?
Yes.
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.
But we need money.
Steal it?
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.
That's right.
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.
We'll do it here.
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.
Nothing will stand in our way.
Nothing!
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.
My uncle Ben's life insurance.
Yes, but I'm afraid...
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.
You are?
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...
...a new supersaver account
with us today.
But the fact is...
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.
Well...
At least we get the toaster.
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.
Oh, yes, I see.
Okay.
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
Peter?
Don't leave me.
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.
Hold it!
Put your arms up! All of them!
Here's your change!
Oh, no. Come on!
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.
Not anymore.
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.
Wait a second.
- Hand her over.
- Of course.
Easy, now.
Butterfingers.
Look out!
Help me!
- Help me!
- I'm coming!
Hang on!
Help!
Thank you.
Aunt May.
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.
Come on.
Shame on you.
There you go.
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.
We sure showed him.
What do you mean, "we"?
- Take me with you, Spider- Man.
- Take me.
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Penny! Over here!
Leave it.
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.
Why? It's a party.
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?
Not to mention your friend the bug.
Not tonight, Harry.
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.
Parker!
Parker!
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.
Beautiful tie.
Get a shot of us with the DA.
Beautiful dress.
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.
Wife.
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...
...is pleased to present
our guest of honour.
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...
...Captain John Jameson.
Hi.
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.
But there was a disturbance.
I don't know you.
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.
I've been reading poetry lately.
Whatever that means.
Day by day he gazed upon her
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...
Don't start.
Can I get you a drink?
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.
John.
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.
Even my father.
He came backstage to borrow cash.
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.
After all these years...
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider- Man and not to your best friend.
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.
Don't act like you're my friend.
You stole M.J. from me.
You stole my father's love.
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?
Huh? Isn't that right?
Huh, brother?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.
What a surprise.
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!
Oh, no. No!
Why is this happening to me?
You told him yes? Just that fast?
It felt right.
Well, you might congratulate me.
Congratulations.
Good luck in the world.
John loves me.
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.
No man will ever want you."
So, what, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...
...trying to prove something
to your father?
Do you really love this guy?
- Very much.
- "Very much"?
That just doesn't fly.
I mean, if you really love the guy,
then the answer is:
"Do I love him? I adore him.
He's my comfortable afghan.
He's all I can think about.
Everything he is, everything he says,
everything he does...
...to me, for me, with me,
is sweet kisses.
He makes up for all the grief
and pain I've ever had...
...and in the dark of the night,
he is there."
That's the answer I need.
Not just "I love him very much".
You read too many love stories.
What about that perfect kiss
you said you had once?
- The guy you believed in?
- That was a fantasy.
That's all he is.
But what's wrong with believing
in love stories?
You seem very okay to me.
My diagnosis?
It's up here.
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?
There is one dream where...
...in my dream...
...I'm Spider- Man.
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.
So you're Spider- Man.
In my dream.
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.
So it's somebody else's dream.
- What's your major? Theatre Arts?
- Science.
Connors?
He flunking you?
He says he might.
There you go.
What about this friend?
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.
I've been there. Who was I?
Identity. Big one.
Me, I go to my shrink.
What does he tell you?
She tells me I need some
strong focus on what I want.
And I have to find out
who won't let me have it, why...
...and then I have to tackle that guy,
let him hear me...
And one more thing. I have to
make sure I'm right about what I want.
Listen...
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider- Man climbing those walls.
That's why you keep falling.
You always have a choice, Peter.
I have a choice.
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...
...make me sad.
Can't you understand?
I'm in love with Mary Jane.
You know I understand.
But I thought you'd learned
the meaning of responsibility.
Oh, you don't know how it feels.
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...
...fairness, justice...
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...
...to take those dreams
out into the world.
I can't live your dreams anymore.
I want a life of my own.
You've been given a gift, Peter.
With great power
comes great responsibility.
Take my hand, son.
No, Uncle Ben.
I'm just Peter Parker.
I'm Spider-Man...
...no more.
No more.
No more.
- You punk!
- Sorry.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Hurry up!
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are?
Someone, please?
.23 electron volts.
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...
...in a very inexcusable manner.
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.
That would be hypocrisy.
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.
" I am glad."
" I am glad."
" I am glad."
Are you glad to hear it?
I am glad...
...to hear it.
In fact, now you mention
the subject...
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.
You could've told me
you were coming.
I was afraid you'd say,
" Don't come."
You look different.
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.
I do my homework now.
You wanna get some chow mein?
Peter...
...l'm getting married.
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.
And who's the groom?
You hadn't decided yet.
You think just because
you saw my play...
...you can talk me out
of getting married?
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.
You're too late.
Will you think about it?
Think about what?
Picking up where we left off.
Where was that?
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.
I don't think it's that simple.
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.
You don't understand.
I'm not an empty seat anymore.
I'm different.
Punch me, I bleed.
I have to go.
I'm getting married in a church.
You are different.
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.
Where the hell did you get that?
In the garbage.
In the garbage?
He must've given up.
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.
Your wife is still on that line.
Flowers? How much?
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.
Get plastic.
Gotta go, big story.
Spider-Man
Spider-Man
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?
Come on, man. Get the money.
Come on, come on.
Help!
Come on!
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.
He was a peaceful man.
And it was all my doing.
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.
Oh, I know I shouldn't.
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...
...and he wanted to drive you.
If only I had stopped him.
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.
I'm responsible.
For what?
For what happened to Uncle Ben.
But you were at the library.
You were doing your homework.
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.
What do you mean?
I went someplace else.
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...
...to buy a car, because I wanted...
...to impress Mary Jane.
It happened so fast.
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.
The thief...
...was running towards me.
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...
...revenge.
I let him go.
I let him get away.
He wanted a car.
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.
Uncle Ben said no...
...and then he shot him.
Uncle Ben was killed that night...
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.
And I...
I held his hand...
...when he died.
I've tried to tell you so many times.
Just one more little chore.
Where are you?
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.
Your father only obsessed
over his work.
Good night, Bernard.
Hello, Harry.
Otto. What do you want?
That precious tritium.
But I need more of it this time.
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!
Hey! Hey!
Stop! Stop! All right!
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.
Kill Spider- Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.
How do I find him?
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?
He takes pictures of Spider- Man
for the Bugle.
Make him tell you where he is.
Have it ready.
Don't hurt Peter!
Somebody, help!
Fire!
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.
Hey, where you going?!
I'm coming!
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Come on. Come on.
Mama.
You got some guts, kid.
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.
Oh, man.
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?
What I need?
What am I supposed to do?
I shouldn't have without...
...knocking.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?
Okay.
And a glass of milk?
That would be nice.
Okay.
Thank you.
You got a message.
It's your aunt.
Thanks.
What's going on?
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...
...and I'm giving him $5.
That's Henry Jackson?
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.
Nine years old, has great ambitions.
Listen, about my last visit...
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.
And I'm proud of you.
And I thank you, and I...
I love you, Peter.
So very, very much.
Hey. Where are all my comic books?
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.
You're getting tall.
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.
Okay. You take
Spider- Man's pictures, right?
I used to.
Where is he?
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.
He...
...quit.
- Why?
Wanted to try other things.
He'll be back, right?
I don't know.
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.
Spider- Man.
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...
...saving old girls like me.
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...
...setting examples for all of us.
Everybody loves a hero.
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...
...just to get a glimpse of the one...
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.
I believe there's a hero in all of us...
...that keeps us honest...
...gives us strength...
...makes us noble...
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...
...and give up the thing
we want the most.
Even our dreams.
Spider- Man did that for Henry...
...and he wonders where he's gone.
He needs him.
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?
But don't strain yourself.
Okay.
Strong focus on what I want.
I'm back!
I'm back!
My back.
My back.
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?
Peter Parker?
Positive.
Thought he was your pal.
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.
He's just a great big jerk.
The world's full of great big jerks.
You're adorable.
It's just the uniform.
Lean your head back for me.
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.
Just put my head back?
Okay.
Wow.
I'm back on the moon.
You up there with me?
- Hiya.
- Surprised?
Very.
Thanks for coming.
Everything okay?
You might say so.
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.
I was afraid to trust you.
But I've been thinking about it...
Listen, there's more for me to say.
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?
I'm saying...
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...
...but I can't.
My mind was playing tricks too.
Do you love me, or not?
I...
...don't.
You don't.
Kiss me.
Kiss you?
I need to know something.
Just one kiss.
What's happening?
Peter Parker...
...and the girlfriend.
What do you want?
I want you to find your friend
Spider- Man.
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.
I don't know where he is.
Find him.
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.
If you lay one finger on her...
You'll do what?
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiance.
Sorry, Jonah.
It's all my fault.
I drove Spider- Man away.
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.
Yes.
Spider- Man was a hero.
I just couldn't see it.
He was a...
A thief! A criminal!
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!
I want him strung up by his web!
I want Spider- Man!
Where is she?
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.
What the hell?
You have a train to catch.
Help!
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!
- It's Spider- Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!
Tell everyone to hang on!
Brace yourselves!
Any more bright ideas?
I got a few, yeah!
Whoa, watch out!
We're slowing down.
Nice and easy, we'll go down.
Slower. Gently.
Is he alive?
He's...
...just a kid.
No older than my son.
It's all right.
We found something.
We won't tell nobody.
It's good to have you back,
Spider- Man.
He's mine!
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.
And me.
Me too.
Very well.
Where do you want him?
And the tritium?
Yes.
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.
First we'll see who's behind the mask.
I can look into your eyes as you die.
Pete.
No.
It can't be.
Harry.
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.
Tritium?
He's making the machine again.
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...
...you killed my father.
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.
Hey!
Hey!
I'm talking to you!
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider- Man's dead.
He's not dead.
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.
Surprise.
As soon as you get free...
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.
Well, I'm not.
Hang on, Mary Jane!
Run!
Let's see you scurry out of this.
Now what?
Dr. Octavius.
We have to shut it down.
Please tell me how.
Peter Parker?
" Brilliant but lazy."
Look at what's happening.
We must destroy it.
I can't destroy it.
I won't.
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.
A privilege.
These things have turned you
into something you're not.
Don't listen to them.
It was my dream.
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...
...and give up the thing
we want the most.
Even our dreams.
You're right.
He's right.
Listen.
Listen to me now.
Listen to me now.
Now, tell me how to stop it.
It can't be stopped.
It's self-sustaining now.
- Think!
- Unless...
The river.
Drown it.
I'll do it.
No!
Hi.
Hi.
This is really heavy.
M.J.
In case we die...
You do love me.
I do.
Even though you said you didn't.
I will not die a monster.
I think I always knew...
...all this time...
...who you really were.
Then you know
why we can't be together.
Spider- Man will always have enemies.
I can't let you take that risk.
I will...
...always be Spider- Man.
You and I can never be.
Mary Jane!
Hello?
Who's that?
Son.
I'm here.
Dad?
- I thought you were...
- No.
I'm alive in you, Harry.
Now it's your turn.
You swore to make Spider- Man pay.
Now make him pay.
But Pete's my best friend.
And I'm your father.
You're weak.
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.
Now you know the truth about Peter.
Be strong, Harry.
Avenge me.
- Avenge me!
- No!
Call Deborah.
The caterer?
Tell her not to open the caviar.
Had to do what I had to do.
Mary Jane.
Peter.
I can't survive without you.
You shouldn't be here.
I know you think we can't be together.
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?
I know there'll be risks.
But I want to face them with you.
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...
...half of ourselves.
I love you.
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.
I've always been
standing in your doorway.
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?
Well, say something.
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.
Go get them, tiger.

I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.
You're here because I need you.
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?
No. This one's special.
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?
Yeah, the brochure is great.
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?
- Illness?
- John.
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.
Of course.
Jean, can you come down, dear?
We'll leave you, then.
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.
Really? I doubt that.
Oh, Charles.
I like this one.
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.
The question is, will you control that power?
Or let it control you?
Warren? Son, is everything all right?
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.
Open the door. Warren.
One second!
Open this door.
Warren.
Let me in there right now. Open the door.
Oh, God.
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.
Bobby!
Thanks, Kitty.
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.
That was my last cigar.
Logan.
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.
Class dismissed.
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.
Simulation complete.
- What was that?
- Danger room session.
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.
- Scott!
- Jean.
Scott. Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.
No, you didn't. The professor did.
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.
Hey, look.
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.
Maybe it's time for us to move on.
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.
Mr. President.
Have a seat, Hank.
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.
Yes, sir. She can do that.
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.
Where is Magneto?
Raven?
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?
In here with us.
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.
You don't want to play games with me?
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?
You wanna know where he is?
Homo sapien.
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.
It's what she stole from the FDA.
Dear Lord.
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.
When an individual acquires great power,
the use or misuse of that power is everything.
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.
Why? Because we are mutants.
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern
without any superhuman authority behind it.
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,
say a father of four with terminal cancer,
into the body of this man?
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...
Professor?
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.
The forecast was for sunny skies.
I'm sorry.
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.
Yes, but we can't be students forever.
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.
He took Jean's death so hard.
Yes, things are better out there,
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.
There's something you're not telling us.
Hank?
Ororo. Charles.
I love what you've done with your hair.
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.
- Suppress?
- Permanently.
They're calling it a cure.
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?
Storm.
They're announcing it now.
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I proudly present the answer to mutation.
Finally, we have a cure.
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?
Not all of us can fit in so easily.
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.
No. Professor.
They can't cure us.
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.
Or any of us, for that matter.
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.
Nobody is talking about extermination.
No one ever talks about it.
They just do it.
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,
the extermination has already begun.
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.
They will force their cure upon us.
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?
Who will you stand with? The humans?
Or us?
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.
Back off.
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.
You know who you're talking to?
Do you?
And what can you do?
So you have talents?
That and more. I know you control metal.
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.
Other than you two.
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?
Could you locate one for me?
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.
Oh, Mr. President.
Shut up.
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.
Please.
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.
Yeah, right.
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.
And his power? What is its range?
You'll see.
Jimmy.
There's someone I would like you to meet.
Hello there, son.
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.
Extraordinary, isn't he?
Yes, he is.
Scott.
Scott.
Scott.
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.
Stop!
Jean?
Scott.
How?
I don't know.
I wanna see your eyes.
- Take these off.
- No.
No.
Trust me. I can control it now.
Open them. You can't hurt me.
- What happened?
- No clue.
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?
I can't see a damn thing.
I can take care of that.
What the...
Logan!
She's alive.
Jean.
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.
The only explanation of Jean's survival
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.
Is she gonna be OK?
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.
What have you done to her?
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.
History will be made here today.
For the first time,
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.
Good. Bring him in.
Are you sure you want to start with him?
I think it's important. Yes.
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.
You ready?
The transformation can be a little jarring.
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.
It'll all be over soon.
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.
Warren, calm down.
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.
Warren, it's a better life.
- It's what we all want.
- No.
It's what you want.
Warren, no!
Told you so.
About time.
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.
Without him, they have nothing.
Read off the guest list.
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."
This one robbed seven banks.
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."
How fascinating.
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.
No!
You saved me.
Eric.
I'm sorry, my dear.
You're not one of us any more.
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?
I have.
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.
As do I.
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.
Jean.
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
More than OK.
Logan, you're making me blush.
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.
It's OK.
It's OK.
- Wait.
- No.
Jean.
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.
The professor said you might be different.
He would know, wouldn't he?
What? You think he's not in your head too?
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.
Where's Scott?
Jean?
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.
Jean, tell me what happened to him.
Oh, God.
Look at me.
Stay with me. Talk to me.
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.
Focus. Focus, Jean.
Kill me.
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.
- Don't say that.
- Please.
- Stop it.
- Kill me.
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.
It'll be all right. We can help you.
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.
I don't want to fix it.
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.
I told you they would draw first blood.
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.
Come. We have an army to build.
I picked something up.
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.
It's a mutant.
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.
More powerful than you.
Where is she?
Logan.
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?
What have you done?
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.
It may be too late.
- Wait for me here.
- What?
I need to see Jean alone.
You were right, Charles.
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.
So, shall we go inside?
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.
Funny, you sound just like her parents.
Nobody gets inside.
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.
- So you want to control me?
- He does.
No. I want to help you.
Help me? What's wrong with me?
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.
For your own good, Jean.
Stay out of my head.
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.
Get out of my head.
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.
No! Stop it!
That's it.
Jean, let me in.
No, Jean.
Jean!
Don't let it control you.
Charles.
My dear. Come with me.
No.
God!
We live in an age of darkness.
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.
A world he tried to heal.
A mission he never saw accomplished.
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.
And that's a vision of a world united.
Kitty.
Bobby.
- You OK?
- Yeah.
It's just... Xavier came to my house.
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.
Yeah, me too.
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.
You have Rogue and I have...
You know, I just miss home.
The first snow and all that.
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.
Don't worry. We won't get caught.
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.
Come on.
This place can be home too.
Thank you for this, Bobby.
You need a lift, kid?
No.
Where are you going?
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.
Yeah, I do.
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.
A hug. A handshake.
A kiss.
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.
Look, if you wanna go, then go.
Just be sure it's what you want.
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?
To go upstairs and unpack?
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.
Just think about what I said, Rogue.
Marie.
Marie.
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"
I can manipulate the metal in this,
but you, you can do anything.
Anything you can think of.
Jean.
Enough.
Enough.
You sound just like him.
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.
As nature intended.
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.
And that fight begins now.
She shouldn't be here with us.
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.
So what now? What do we do?
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.
It was, son.
And it still is. We'll find you a room.
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.
Rogue.
Hey, Rogue.
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.
Logan.
Logan.
- Logan.
- Jean?
Logan. Where am I? Logan.
Logan. Logan.
- Logan.
- Stop.
Logan. Logan. Logan.
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.
She killed the professor.
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.
Listen, why can't you see the truth?
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...
Because you love her.
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.
So if you're with us, then be with us.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?
I'm looking for someone.
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.
Come on, Iceman.
Make a move.
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.
Today's attack was only our first salvo.
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...
Join us or stay out of our way.
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.
Let's go. Keep it moving.
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.
Absolutely no metal.
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.
They have their weapons.
We have ours.
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,
take control of the cure,
and destroy its source.
And then nothing can stop us.
Jean.
I know the smell of your domatium
from a mile away.
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.
And you stood there and let him die?
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.
OK.
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
Approaching target dead ahead.
Set for 360-degree incursion.
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.
OK, send them in.
OK.
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!
OK. I give up.
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.
Leave that to me.
Storm. Storm.
What are you doing back here?
I need help.
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.
Let's suit up.
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.
Yeah. We're outnumbered.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
But we lost Scott.
We lost the professor.
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Are you?
Then we stand together.
X-Men.
All of us.
We're in.
Let's go.
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?
Dad, what's going on?
It's an earthquake.
We're trapped.
Charles always wanted to build bridges.
My God.
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!
In chess, the pawns go first.
Humans and their guns.
Plastic. They've learned.
That's why the pawns go first.
Target the bridge.
Fire!
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.
Then God help us.
They're coming for him.
Don't ever do that again.
You men cover the doors!
Everybody get together! And hold this line!
Traitors to their own cause.
Finish them!
Not yet.
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.
With pleasure.
Hold it!
He's going for the boy!
Not if I get there first.
Kitty!
Come on.
Grow those back.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.
Going somewhere?
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?
Yes, I am.
Girls.
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.
Calm down. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be OK.
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."
Oh, you get the point.
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.
No.
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.
This way.
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.
Who's hiding, dickhead?
Don't. No.
Don't.
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.
Do we look like we need your help?
It's time to end this war.
Take cover.
Get out of the way.
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.
Go! Go! Go!
We work as a team.
Best defense is a good offence.
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?
Go ahead.
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.
Right.
You're in over your head, Bobby.
Maybe you should go back to school.
You never should have left.
This is it.
Hey.
Make it a strike.
You never learn, do you?
Actually, I do.
I'm...
One of them?
This is what they want for all of us.
It's over, Jean.
It's over.
No! Don't shoot!
No!
Everybody get out of there!
Bobby!
What have I done?
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.
Go.
Jean!
Jean!
I know you're still there!
You would die for them?
No, not for them.
For you.
For you.
Save me.
I love you.
You're back.
I'm sorry.
I had to.
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.
It's what I want.
Hey.
Good to see you, buddy.
With the thanks of a grateful nation
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,
human and mutant alike,
Dr. Hank McCoy.
Way to go, fur ball.
Morning.
Hello, Moira.
Charles.

It's me, Peter Parker.
Your friendly neighborhood... you know.
I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider.
Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me.
Now...
- Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!
people really like me.
Hey, stick around! It's gonna start again in a couple minutes.
- Yeah... - That's OK.
The city is safe and sound.
Guess I've had something to do with that.
My uncle Ben would be proud.
I still go to school,
top of my class.
Now, the Hamiltonian shows us
that the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field.
From the form of this matrix,
we can see...?
Miss Stacey?
- That only the m=0 quantum states are affected.
Correct! Good work, Miss Stacey.
Parker.
You got something to add?
No, sir.
And I'm in love
with the girl of my dreams.
Hi. Um, Miss Watson left a ticket for me?
Peter Parker.
Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you.
It's my girlfriend!
Harry!
I need to talk to you.
Explain things.
Tell it to my father.
Raise him from the dead.
I'm your friend, Harry.
I cared about your father.
MJ.
Peter.
Was I good?
- Good?
You were great. You were...
- You say great?
I love my flowers. They're beautiful.
And those are from Harry.
Was he here tonight?
- Yeah, I ran into him outside.
What's with you guys anyway?
It's complicated.
Tell me again, was I really good?
I was so nervous.
My knees were shaking.
Your knees were fine.
- The applause was not very loud.
Yes, it was.
It's the acoustics.
It's all about diffusion.
It keeps the sound waves from grouping.
You see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it's like an...
- You are such a nerd.
Did you see that one?
You know what?
I'd like to sing on stage for the rest of my life
with you in the first row.
I'll be there.
Tell me you love me.
I love you.
I love you so much.
I always have.
You can't hide here, Flint.
I'm just here to see my daughter.
You are an escaped convict.
The cops are looking for you.
You're not getting near her.
You're nothing but a common thief.
You maybe even killed a man.
It wasn't even like that.
Wasn't.
I had good reason for what I was doing.
And that's the truth.
You and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together.
I live in a prison. It's a great truth.
And that is the truth that you left behind.
Right there in that bedrooom.
I missed you.
I missed you too, Daddy.
I promise
I'll make you healthy again.
Whatever it takes.
I'll get the money.
- You get out of here.
Now.
I'm not a bad person.
Just had bad luck.
Peter, what is it?
It's MJ...
I'm gonna ask her to marry me!
Oh, Peter! Oh!
The day that uncle Ben asked me to marry him,
he was so scared and excited.
And very young.
And I loved him so fiercely.
Then you said yes, right?
No. I wanted to say yes, but I said no.
I wasn't ready,
neither was he.
So we took our time.
Looked forward to it.
Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love.
A man has to be understanding
and put his wife before himself.
Can you do that, Peter?
Yeah. I think I can.
Then you have my blessing.
I hope you've considered a proper proposal.
Your uncle had it all planned.
He took me to the beach one Sunday.
He was a knockout in his bathing suit.
And I, I didn't look too bad myself.
We were very good swimmers.
It was a beautiful day,
and he said: "Let's swim to the island."
And at the island,
we found a perfect spot by an old tree,
and we lay down and looked up at the sky.
And then he said, "Close your eyes, May."
And I did. And then he said, "Open them."
And I did.
And he was holding this ring.
Dazzling, in front of me.
I thought it was the sun.
We'd be married 50 years
come August... if...
So.
I hope you make it very special
for Mary Jane.
Do something she'll never forget.
Give her this.
Come on.
Take it.
Harry.
- You knew this was coming, Pete.
Listen to me! I didn't kill your father!
He was trying to kill me. He killed himself.
Shut up!
I'm still here, Peter!
Hate those things.
Harry.
Harry.
Harry!
Oh my God.
Harry!
Come on!
God!
- And clear!
No response.
- Recharge. Let's go again.
Clear!
No response.
We charge it one more time. And clear!
Captain Stacey.
What's this?
- Flint Marko, the guy we tied to the Ben Paker homicide.
What about him?
- He just broke out of Rikers.
And?
- He's on the run.
He's in the marshlands. I think we got him.
There he is!
"DANGER
PARTICLE PHYSICS TEST FACILITY
KEEP OUT"
Euton, take the west side. Tommy, take the east.
Where'd he go?
That's it. It's charged.
- Right.
Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on 1.
There's a change in the silicon mass.
It's probably a bird. It'll fly away when we fire it up.
Initiating demoleculisation.
How is he?
- He's gonna be OK.
But there's been some memory impairment.
Particularly his short-term memory.
Right now, he can't remember the accident
or anything that happened to him recently.
Is it permanent?
It could be.
Only time will tell.
He's awake if you want to see him.
Uh-- maybe I should wait.
Nah, it's fine. Just keep it brief. Allow him to rest.
Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Hit my head.
Yeah.
Doctor said I was in an accident. Hit and run.
I don't remember much of anything.
My father--
he died, right?
This is all so weird.
Hi. I got here as fast as I could.
I know that face.
How are you doing?
I don't know.
Last thing I remember, I was falling...
somewhere.
You're still fine.
We love you, Harry.
It feels like
somehow I've been gone for a really long time.
Now I'm back home.
It's good to have you back.
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to scoot, OK?
OK.
- All right, thank you.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, great.
I think he's gonna be fine.
Think so.
And you guys seem great.
- Yeah.
You have lovely friends.
My best friends.
I'd give my life for them.
Yeah?
- It's me.
- Oh! Hey!
You know I can't open the door.
It's stuck again?
Come on and help me.
I'm coming.
The review.
- Oh!
The hated it. They hated me.
Well, they can't hate you.
"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl.
"Easy on the eyes, but not on the ears.
"Her small voice didn't carry past the first row."
That's ridiculous. I was right there.
You were in the first row.
Yeah, but that's...
Listen. You were great.
That's a critic.
This is something you're gonna have to get used to.
Believe me, I know.
Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.
- This isn't about you.
It's about me.
It's about my career.
- I know, and I'm just saying,
you can't let it bring you down.
You just gotta believe in yourself.
You pull yourself together,
and you get right back on the horse.
- Don't give me the horse thing.
Try to understand how I feel.
It's just...
I look at these words,
and it's like my father wrote them.
All cars. All cars in the vicinity of 54th and 6th Ave, please report. Crane out of control. Approach with caution.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Sorry.
Oh my God.
Seven Atom to central. That crane .
It's bigger than we thought. We're gonna need a major mobilization right away.
Just gotta douse the accelerator! Now!
OK, Gwen.
I've got a secret. It's my call for ya.
What is that thing doing in my background?
Captain Stacey, the guys look out of shot of it.
They can't shut down the crane.
Get Edison on the phone.
Have them kill the power of the whole block.
Are you all right?
It's coming back!
Oh my God. It's Gwen!
What?
What's she doing up there?
I don't know. I just saw her last night. She said she had a modeling gig.
Who are you?
- It's Brock, sir.
Eddie Brock, jr.
I work at the Daily Bugle.
And I'm dating your daughter.
You OK?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
Thank you.
Hey, Spidey, hold on. Bugle needs a photo.
Thank God you're OK.
- Daddy!
Hey. I'm the new guy.
- New guy?
From now on, I'm gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle.
So-- smile! Are you smiling?
Where's the other guy?
- Peter Parker?
Yeah, um, look, between you and me--
The guy's kind of an amateur.
Have you noticed, his stuff makes you look a little... bloated.
Just a little chunky.
- OK...
Don't have to worry about that anymore, buddy.
Dazzeling.
Just a little something the boys in the ad department and I whipped up.
As you know, circulation of the Bugle has been pretty good.
Though not as good as the New York Times
or the Daily News
or the Post or several other smaller...
- Get on with it, moron!
What?
- Your blood pressure, Mr Jameson.
Your wife told me to tell you to watch the anger.
- You tell my wife...
Thank you.
So, I propose this campaign:
"DAILY BUGLE" -- that's obvious.
"IT'S HIP, IT'S NOW" -- I came up with that one.
"IT'S WOW" -- that's actually Eric's.
"AND HOW!" -- that's me again.
Time to take your pill.
Not that one.
Not that one.
Drink plenty of water.
Thank you.
Continue.
He's busy.
Oh, no, I'm just here to talk to you, babe.
(- What's that smell?)
That's a little something called
"Nice 'n' Easy".
What's on you?
- It's called "Go Away".
That is the dumbest idea you've ever had. You have had some daunting...
- Blood pressure.
Hey, where are you going?
Who are you?
- You hired him last week.
Freelance.
- I did? What's that smell?
Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.
Wow, I really like that shirt.
Here. It's a crane accident. Check out the light source.
He likes my shirt.
Hey, Betty.
- Hey, Pete. You better get in there.
A new guy. He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.
Uh. Thanks.
Parker! You're late! Maybe too late. Bruckner here beat ya to it.
It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.
- I got you this.
But he got me this.
Wait. How'd you get that? I didn't see you.
- How'd you get that high?
Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.
A flagpole?
Which one do we use?
- I like Bernstein's.
It's better.
- Cheaper, too.
Congratulations, son. We'll use your shot and pay you 50 bucks.
Uh-- all right, JJ. I'm your man.
I know more about what makes a good picture
than any photographer in this town.
See, photography, it's not just about
-- no offense -- flagpoles. Whatever.
It's about lighting. Composition. Drama.
I want a staff job, sir.
I have a girl that I intend to marry, and--
I have this stupid little dream of-- working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time.
J. Jonah Jameson.
Well, we do have an opening.
Johnson quit, remember?
- You fired him.
- Whatever.
Wait a minute. I know what makes a good picture,
and I've been here for a long time. If there's a staff job,
Mr Jameson, I think I deserve it.
He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us for years.
He's done a great job.
You want a staff job, and you want a staff job.
Anybody care about what I want?
I do.
- Shut up. Get out.
I want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is.
He's a fake. He's full of stickum.
Catch him in the act.
"Spider-Man with his hand in the cookie jar".
Whoever brings me that photo gets the job.
What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go!
I'm on it, boss.
You'll never get that shot.
We'll see.
You know,
I guess one person can make a difference.
'Nuff said.
Welcome home, Harry.
Thank God you're all right.
Thanks, Bernard.
Aperitif?
- Sure.
Got you a little homecoming present.
Wha-- It's your old ball!
- Yeah.
Thanks, buddy.
We were pretty good in the backyard, weren't we?
We were terrible. And we tried out for the varsity team.
Yeah, for the cheerleaders.
- Right.
Hey, do I have any girlfriends?
I don't know.
- You don't?
Hey Bernard, do I have any girlfriends?
- Not that I know of, sir.
That's a pretty cool pass, huh?
It's OK.
Looks like I'm not worrying for money.
No.
Well, I bet I can turn this little girlfriend thing around.
You know,
he always appreciated how you helped me through high school.
I just wish I could remember more about him.
He loved you.
That's the main thing.
Hey, let's watch the game in the kitchen.
Get something to eat.
- OK.
Whoa, catch that!
Did you see that?
Still got the moves.
Yeah!
Why are you stopping?
What is she doing here?
Gary, you were supposed to call her agent.
Hi, honey.
We tried to reach you.
I'm sorry.
One critic?
- No, all the papers, dear.
Mary Jane, honey. Sit down. Let's explain it to you.
- If you like, we could say you became ill.
That was so poorly handled.
- Yeah. Let's just rehearse.
All right, Spidey!
Excuse me, miss. Let me see that gorgeous smile.
Hi, Eddie.
You're so beautiful.
This is front page stuff.
I've got to practice. I'll see you later, OK?
How about tonight?
- Not tonight.
Why not?
Think of that amazing-- night that we had.
We had a coffee, Eddie.
Hey, beautiful.
One more.
Everything OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
You're not still mad at me, are you?
No, Peter. I'm proud of you.
Hey. I'm gonna be swingin' it from over there.
So you know where to look.
Give 'em a good show.
Don't worry about that review.
We're gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night.
Promise.
- Yeah.
Isn't that that guy from that prison break?
He fits.
Hey you! Halt!
Cover the back!
Fire!
People of the city of New York, I am here today
because I fell 62 storeys
and someone caught me.
Someone who never asks for anything in return.
Someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is.
Hey, MJ.
- Harry.
Where is Pete?
Um-- taking somebody's picture, I guess.
I'm so happy to see you. You look so good.
I've never felt better.
It's a weird feeling, not knowing New York.
Bump on the head, I'm just free as a bird.
Will you bump me on the head?
- Bop.
Hey, Pete said you're in a play.
You came. You sent me flowers.
I did?
I'll come again tonight.
You can't.
I--I was let go.
What happened.
I wasn't very good.
You know, this is embarrassing, but...
I once wrote you a play in high school.
You wrote me a play?
Yeah.
- Harry, that's the sweetest thing.
I ask you: When you're dropping without a parachute
or your store's being robbed
or your house is on fire,
who is it that brakes your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children?
Spider-Man!
They love me!
Then let's hear it! For your one and only friendly neighborhood...
Spider-Man!
Kiss him!
Kiss him!
Go ahead, lay it right on me.
Really?
- Yeah, they'll love it.
Kiss him! Kiss him!
- No, Spider-Man, no!
Right...
Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.
Hey, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Jig's up, pal.
I don't want to hurt you.
Leave now.
- I guess you haven't heard?
I'm the sheriff 'round these parts.
OK.
Where do all these guys come from?
Bonsoir. Le monsieur a-t-il un "reservation"?
I'm sorry, I don't speak...
- But this is a French restaurant, non?
Oui.
Name, please?
- Parker, Peter.
Ah. Here we are.
Table for two. Pekar.
Parker.
- That is what I said.
Pekar.
Um, I have a request.
My girlfriend will be coming,
and I have this ring.
Ah. All.
Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, hein?
Yes, and I want to do something very special.
I love it.
Romance.
I am French.
When I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring...
In ze bottom of her glass?
Perfect.
- Magnifique.
Also I thought, at the same time
could the musicians
play this song?
Their favorite.
And take good care of the ring.
Ah oui, with my life, monsieur.
- S'il vous plat.
- Oui.
I like you.
Thank you.
"Bon" chance.
Bonne chance.
OK, so... How would you like some champagne?
How'd that get in there?
Aw, don't cry.
Look at you, wow! Beautiful.
- Thanks.
Is this place in your budget?
Oh, it's a special occasion.
You're on Broadway.
I don't feel like much of a star tonight.
Well, you are a star.
And you've earned it.
Peter, you have no idea how I feel right now.
Oh no, I know exactly how you feel.
Listen.
I have been through this.
Happens to me all the time.
I see Spider-Man posters in the window.
Kids running around with me on their sweaters.
Big Hallowe'en item.
I don't know, I guess I've become something of an icon.
Like yesterday.
They keep screaming: "Spider-Man! Spider-Man!"
I don't know, I mean,
I'm thinking to myself,
"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?"
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
Hi. My parents and I are just having dinner here.
Hello.
I'm Gwen Stacey.
This is Mary Jane Watson.
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time.
Gwen is my lab partner in Dr Connor's class.
Pete's something of a genius. I'd be completely lost without him.
Which actually reminds me--
Pete, if you got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man,
could you bring it to class?
I'd really love it.
For my portfolio.
After all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?
I can't imagine.
Well, it was lovely to meet you.
Good night.
- Good night.
Uh, she's in my science class. It's not her best subject.
What?
How come you never mentioned her?
She's your lab partner,
you saved her life,
she thinks you're a genius and she had her polished fingernails all over you?
Or didn't you notice?
And she gave Spider-Man the key to the city.
I'll never forget that.
She's just a girl in my class.
- Let me ask you something.
When you kissed her,
who was kissing her?
Spider-Man or Peter?
What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.
That was our kiss.
Why would you do that?
You must have known how it made me feel.
Do you want to push me away?
Push you away?
Why would I want to push you away? I love you.
You're my girlfriend. She's a girl in my class, MJ.
I don't feel very well. I'm sorry. I have to go.
Where are you going?
- Please don't follow me.
Here we are.
Hi, it's MJ. Sing a song at the beep. Beep!
Hello. Uh...
I wish you'd pick up the phone.
I don't know what's going on.
I don't know if you got the messages, or what.
But...
I just want to talk to you.
OK. Call me, all right?
Hallo?
- Mr Parker?
Yeah?
- This is Detective Neil Garettfrom the 2nd precinct.
I'm calling on behalf of Captain Stacey.
He would like you to come down to the station to speak with him.
Originally we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine,
was your husband's killer.
We were wrong.
What?
- Turns out Mr Carradine was only an accomplice.
The actual killer is still at large.
What are you talking about?
This is the man who killed your husband.
His name is Flint Marko.
He's a small-time crook who's been in and out of prison.
You got this wrong.
Two days ago, he escaped.
Evidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate.
And we have a couple of witnesses who corroborate the story.
No, wait, sir. You don't want to do this.
Get in! What are you doing?
Would you put these photos away, please?
I'm sorry, Mrs Parker. I know this isn't easy,
but please be patient with us.
We're doing our job. We will catch him.
No, you're not doing your job.
I watched my uncle die.
We chased down the wrong man.
Now you're telling me there's suspicions for two years? Witnesses?
Why weren't we told about this?
- Settle down, sir.
No, I have no intention of settling down!
This man killed my uncle,
and he's still out there!
L-20 Parkway, all officers in the vicinity please report.
We have an abandoned vehicle and an abandoned man in the middle of the street.
Sorry, Wabash Avenue.
Peter, it's MJ.
I'm not here about what happened at dinner. Just please open up.
Aunt May called me. She told me about what happened.
She's worried about you.
I'm worried about you.
Don't be. I'm fine.
I don't want you to do something stupid.
Like try to find my uncle's killer?
And do something you'll regret.
Like...
with that other guy.
He had a gun on me.
I made a move, and he fell. I told you that.
- I'm not accusing you of anything.
C-22, auto at 566, 9th Avenue...
- Will you turn that thing off?
Peter, I'm here because I care about you.
And I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty, but--
I want to be here for you.
- OK.
I get it. Thank you.
But, uh, I'm fine.
I don't need your help.
Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter.
Even Spider-Man.
90 - X-ray - 98.

1-3-Tom has responded 10-20 at 540, East 107...
male inside apartment B on first floor...
310-11 of a residence, 738...
Don't hurt me! Just give me a chance!
- What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance?
Did you?
Where am I?
What is this?
I feel...
Wow.
This feels good.
This is something else.
What do you think?
I've never seen anything like it.
I'm a physicist, not a biologist, but...
I'll look at it in the morning, run some tests.
- Can we do that now?
It seems to like you.
Don't let any of that get on you.
- Why not?
It has the characteristics of a symbiote,
which needs to bond to a host to survive.
And sometimes, these things in nature, when they bind,
they can be hard to unbind.
Bank robbery in progress, First Eastern Bank Bismarck.
Another sand storm is reported in the vicinity. All cars, proceed with caution.
Marko.
Buddy, love the new outfit.
This is exactly what I need to scoop, partner. Give me some of that web action.
See you, chum.
What the hell?
Flint Marko?
What do you want from me?
Remember Ben Parker?
The old man you shot down in cold blood?
What does it matter to you anyway?
Everything!
It's time to pay, Marko.
Good riddance.
Re-ent!
Not now.
This is a free country. It's not a rent-free country.
Leave me alone.
Give me rent.
You'll get your rent when you fix this damn door!
That wasn't cool.
He is good boy.
He must be in some kind of trouble.
Flint Marko, the man who killed uncle Ben--
he was killed last night.
O my--
What happened?
Spider-Man killed him.
Spider-Man?
I don't understand.
Spider-Man doesn't kill people.
What happened?
I... He was...
I thought that you'd feel...
He deserved it, didn't he?
I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die.
Aunt May, he killed uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben meant the world to us.
But he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts.
It's like a poison.
It can take you over.
Before you know it,
turn us into something ugly.
Hello.
Hey, Harry, it's MJ.
Hi.
- I need some company.
Are you doing anything? Can I stop by?
Yeah, sure. Come on over.
OK. Are you sure it's OK?
I'm not doing anything.
Please, come over.
OK, I'll see you soon.
Great.
- Bye.
Bernard?
- Yes, Mr Osborn?
We're having a guest. Can you get some food?
A guest?
- Yeah, a guest.
A guest guest?
Will you just get some food?
Rightaway, sir.
Hey, Mr Ditkovitch.
An orange?
No, thanks.
Listen--
I'm really sorry for what happened earlier.
I shouldn't have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about.
Ah, it's not big deal.
But if you feel that bad about it,
you can buy me pizza some time.
Today's good.
OK.
Have problem with the phone?
No, no, I was just-- was trying to figure out what to say.
If it's a woman you're calling,
then you say: "You're a good woman,
"I'm good man."
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
He's calling a woman.
- Are you calling Mary Jane?
I think that would be so good...
- It's none of your business.
Go! Go.
Give her a call.
- Thanks.
Bye.
- Bye.
You hungry?
Yeah.
Come in.
Hope you like peppers.
I love 'em.
Oh, the butter!
Well, we can use that part.
"You've been dreaming."
"Nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night."
All right.
- When did you write that?
- It's intense.
So, do you want the part?
I'd love to be in your play.
- Cheers.
You know, there's not even a scar.
Barely.
Sorry.
- Me too.
I didn't mean to do that.
- No, it's OK. Please.
Forgive me.
Mary Jane.
Mary Jane.
Mary Jane, please!
- I'm sorry.
You've taken your eye off the ball.
What have you done?
Avenge me!
My father-- he died, right?
Yeah.
Just wish that I could remember more about him.
Well, he loved you.
That's the main thing.
I swear on my father's grave: Spider-Man will pay.
Harry.
Remember me?
Yes, father.
I remember.
I was right about her,
about Peter,
about everything.
You know what you must do.
Make him suffer. Make him wish he were dead.
First we attack his heart.
Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep.
Hey, MJ.
It's Peter.
I want to talk to you about last night.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I know you were just there to help, and--
I, uh-- I don't know, I want to see you.
If you want Peter to live,
you're gonna do something for me.
Yeah?
- It's Ursula.
Come in.
Hi, Pete.
- Hi.
There's a phone call for you.
It's Mary Jane, she called back!
Really?
- Yeah!
I put the phone on top of the thing.
Thanks. OK.
Hey.
- Hi.
I was so glad you called.
I've been-- trying to--
- Can you meet me?
You bet.
- Now?
OK. Where?
At the bridge, in the park.
On my way.
Hey. I love you.
You look beautiful.
Peonies.
You OK?
No.
There's something I have to tell you, Pete.
- OK.
It's not working.
You and me.
What?
I don't want to see you anymore.
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
I'm lonely.
You aren't there for me.
I can't do this.
It's over.
- No. Please.
Please don't say that.
I know, I've been selfish.
But I can do better. I can change.
- It's not that simple.
We love each other! I love you!
And we have problems. When people have problems, they work it out.
They talk to each other.
Look, you see?
You know what this is?
You know what I want for us?
- There's someone else.
I've fallen in love with someone else.
She says that she's lonely,
and that I'm not there for her.
There's another guy.
How are you holding up?
Not good.
Harry, I was going to propose to her.
Really?
She's been going through a tough time lately.
Career.
I mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club--
that's not exactly what she had in mind for herself.
A singing waitress? What are you talking about?
She was fired from the show.
Didn't she tell you?
She was fired?
She was fired and she told you?
She didn't tell me?
That's why I asked you here, Pete.
I'm the other guy.
What?
Look, she came to me one afternoon, troubled.
She needed someone, and I was there for her.
I've always loved her, Pete.
You know that.
It just...
started.
I don't believe this.
I don't believe you.
I'm really sorry.
I just thought you should know.
Can I warm you up?
Yes, please.
How's the pie?
So good.
Would you like a drink?
I'm sorry.
What was I thinking? Bad for the public image, right, Mr Key-to-the-city?
What did you do to her?
I did what you failed to do.
I was there for her.
Mary Jane and I, we understand each other.
She doesn't know what you are.
Peter. She knows me very well.
And when she kissed me,
it was just like she used to kiss me.
That taste.
Strawberries.
How d'ya like that, Spidey?
That all you got?
Stinks, doesn't it?
I protected you in high school. Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.
You gonna kill me like you killed my father?
I'm done trying to convince you.
You took him from me.
He loved me.
No:
he despised you.
You were an embarrassment for him.
Look at that little Goblin junior.
Gonna cry?
"THIEF! Spider-Man shows his true colors"
- Spider-Man used to make me feel safe.
Now I'm afraid to walk home from work.
My son thought the world of this guy.
I have a 9 year old daughter, loves Spider-Man.
Who's she supposed to look up to now?
This is the guy they gave the key to the city to?
I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.
Cheers! New staff photographer!
- I just got lucky.
This is so wonderful for you.
Well, you might wanna tell JJ to make a little more wall space.
Good morning.
- It's a beautiful day, huh?
What was it you said, I'll never get that picture?
There's your hero.
I never thought he'd really do that.
See? Right there,
you made a judgment call.
You gotta see it as it is.
It's funny you should say that,
'cause I was looking through some old photos, and
looks very, uh-- similar.
OK-- Well, I gotta get back to work.
You're trash, Brock.
Excuse me?
Your picture is a fake.
Parker, you are such a boy scout.
When are you gonna give a guy a break?
You want forgiveness?
Get religion.
What's going on here?
- Are you guys all right?
Yeah, no, we're just horsin' around.
Look, I'm begging you. If you do this,
I will lose everything.
There's not a paper in town that will hire me.
You should've thought of that earlier.
What are you doing, Peter?
Show this to the editor. Tell him to check his source next time.
It's a fake!
Empire State Photographic Department confirms it.
Pack your things. Get out of my building.
I was just...
- You're fired!
You know we're gonna have to print a retraction now.
Haven't printed a retraction in 20 years!
"SORRY SPIDEY
Bugle drops charges"
Shalom?
- Mr Parker?
Dr Connors here.
- Oh, Dr Connors!
How are you?
Quite a specimen you left me, Parker.
Its chemistry is not unlike the meteorites of the 70s.
Thanks. It's good.
You know what, Parker?
Parker?
Give me some milk.
It amplifies characteristics of its host.
Hey, give me another cookie.
Specially aggression.
This can be dangerous.
Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?
You got any with nuts?
Um-- I have some nuts, I could make some.
Go make me some.
Peter?
- No, no. Of course not.
Your shots are so good.
I'd love to shoot you sometime.
Peter Parker! Peter...
Parker!
Miss Brent, that's not the position I hired you for!
Black suit Spider-Man!
Peter, these are incredible!
We gotta have these, Jonah.
I'll pay you the usual rate.
If you want the shots, I'll take the staff job. Double the money.
You are really gonna dig this joint.
Do you think I'm dressed all right?
Too fancy or...
You're looking fine, babe.
Thank you.
Love that little giggle.
Oh, this is so cool!
I have never been to a jazz club before.
I hope we can get a table.
Find us some shade.
Thanks, .
Right this way, sir.
"RESERVED"
Thank you.
I'm so loving this.
- Oh, me too.
Isn't that your old girlfriend?
Yeah.
Do you want to go someplace else?
No, no. I'll be OK.
Mary Jane, show us what you got.
I'll be right back.
- Right.
Peter?
This is for you.
Double time!
Thanks.
Now dig all this.
That was all for her?
I'm so sorry.
You all right, Mary Jane?
I'm fine.
- OK.
Hey.
What's wrong with you?
You.
Can I help you, sir?
No.
- Is everything OK here, Paul?
Yeah, is everything OK here, Paul?
Take him out of here.
- Let's go, sir.
Take your hand offa me. Now.
Peter, stop!
Who are you?
I don't know.
It's Brock, Sir.
Edward Brock junior.
I come before you today
humbled
and humiliated
to ask you for one thing.
I want you to kill Peter Parker.
Parker?
Hi, Peter.
- Hi.
You don't seem to have changed the room around very much.
Of course, there's not much you can do,
is there?
When we spoke on the phone,
I sensed something was bothering you,
so I thought I'd just come by.
How's Mary Jane?
I don't know.
I never heard from you.
Did you ever propose?
You said
a husband's gotta put a wife before himself.
I'm not ready.
But what happened?
You seemed so sure.
Yeah. I...
I heard her, aunt May.
I don't know what to do.
You start by doing the hardest thing.
You forgive yourself.
I believe in you, Peter.
You're a good person.
And I know you will find a way to put it right.
In time.
I don't like Spider-Man.
I want him dead too, Flint.
That's why I've been looking for you.
Oh yeah. I know all about you.
Like the fact that Spider-Man
won't let you help your poor daughter.
It's just-- It doesn't seem right to me.
Look.
I wanna kill the Spider.
You wanna kill the Spider.
Together, he doesn't stand a chance.
Interested?
Yeah.
So--
where to?
"BREAKING NEWS: City in crisis"
- All New York is holding its breath
as a hostage crisis continues to unfold.
Just thirty minutes ago, police came across this startling sight:
A young woman held hostage in a taxi
suspended 80 storeys above the ground
in what appears to be a giant web.
Every attempt by the police to rescue the hostage
has been flaunted by the Sandman.
Compounding the danger is the appearance of a strange black-suited figure.
Early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited Spider-Man. But he is now been identified
as something entirely different.
The hostage has been identified
as Mary Jane Watson,
an actrice recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway.
We're now going to take you live to the scene with Jennifer Dugan.
Jennifer?
- We're only about 100 feet away now, Hal, and--
Wait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web.
It seems to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering.
"SPIDER-MAN, STOP US IF YOU CAN"
Apparently, Spider-Man is being challenged to some sort of confrontation.
And that raises serious questions about what kind of chance he'd stand
against such overwhelming...
Harry.
I need your help.
Can't take them both. Not by myself.
You don't deserve my help.
Harry,
she needs us.
Get out.
If I may, Sir.
I've seen things in this house
I've never spoken of.
What are you trying to tell me?
The night your father died
I cleaned his wound.
The blade that pierced his body
came from his glider.
I know
you're trying to defend your father's honor,
but there's no question
that he died by his own hand.
I loved your father.
As I have loved you, Harry.
As your friends love you.
Look!
He seems to have come out of nowhere to answer the prayers of the city,
just when all hope seemed to be lost.
Peter?
They're gonna kill us both.
I'm gonna get you out of this.
Watch out!
Hey, Parker.
My God. Eddie?
Oh, my spider-sense is tickling.
If you know what I'm talking about.
We can find a way to settle this.
You're so right.
I'm thinking-- humiliation.
Kinda like you humiliated me.
Do you remember?
Do you remember what you did to me?
You made me lose my girl.
Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.
How's that sound, tiger?
Hold on, Mary Jane!
Mary Jane.
It's hard to believe what's happening.
The brutality of it.
I don't know how he can take any more.
This can be a tragic day
for the people of New York.
It could be the end of Spider-Man.
Awesome!
- Wicked cool!
You came.
Looks like just in the nick of time.
A couple of minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either.
What're you gonna do.
I'm needing some help over here.
I'm a little busy right now.
Give me your hand!
Parker!
Parker, where...
I need a photographer!
Hey, kid. You want a job?
Why would I want a job?
I'm just a kid.
All right, how much for the camera?
One hundred bucks.
- A hundred bucks?
All right, you little prick. Here.
Film's extra.
Gotcha.
Pete, watch out!
You still got any more?
- Hang on!
To what?
Go, buddy!
- Got her!
You OK?
Yeah.
Good.
Hey, Pete.
Am I interrupting?
Never wound
what you can't kill.
Eddie-- this suit-- you gotta take it off!
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
I know what it feels like.
It feels good.
The power. Everything.
But you'll lose yourself.
Let it go.
I like being bad.
It makes me happy.
Harry!
Peter, what are you doing?
No!
Eddie!
Harry?
- Mary Jane.
I'm going to get help.
Stay.
I didn't want this.
But I had no choice.
We always have a choice.
You had a choice when you killed my uncle.
My daughter was dying.
I needed money.
I was scared.
I told your uncle all I wanted was the car.
What is it?
- I need your car.
He said to me:
"Why don't you just put down the gun and go home?"
I realize now he was just trying to help me.
Then I saw my partner running over with the cash,
and the gun was in my hand.
Did a terrible thing to you.
I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back.
I'm not asking you to forgive me.
I just want you to understand.
I've done terrible things too.
You didn't choose to be this.
The only thing left to me now
is my daughter.
I forgive you.
Hey, pal. How are you doing?
Been better.
We'll get you through this.
No.
You should never forgive...
...said those things.
None of that matters, Peter.
You're my friend.
Best friend.
Whatever comes our way.
Whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice.
My friend Harry taught me that.
He chose to be the best of himself.
It's the choices that make us who we are,
and we can always choose to do what's right.
I'm through with love
I'll never fall again
Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you
Or no one
And so I'm through with love
I've locked my heart
I'll keep my feelings there
I have stocked my heart
With icy frigid air
And I mean to care
For no one...

I feel like you're driving me to
court martial. This is crazy.
What did I do? I feel like you're
gonna pull over and snuff me.
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forest...
- We can talk, sir.
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
No, you intimidate them.
Dear God, you're a woman!
I honestly, I couldn't have called that.
I mean, I would apologize, but isn't
that what we're going for here?
I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.
Well you have actually excellent
bone structure there. I'm kinda...
having a hard time not looking
at you now. Is that weird?
C'mon, it's OK, laugh. Hey!
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.
It is true you went 12-for-12 with
last year's Maxim cover models?
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no. March and I
had a scheduling conflict,
but fortunately the Christmas
cover was twins. Anything else?
You're kidding me
with a hand up, right?
Is it cool if I take
a picture with you?
Yes, it's very cool.
I don't wanna see this
on your MySpace page.
Please, no gang signs.
No, throw it up, I'm kidding.
Yeah, peace! I love peace.
I'd be outta job with peace.
C'mon! Just click it, don't change
the settings, just click it.
What's going on?
Jimmy, stay with Stark!
Lie down!
Son of a bitch!
- Wait, wait, give me a gun!
- Stay here!
Tony Stark.
LAS VEGAS, 36 HOURS EARLIER
Visionary. Genius.
American patriot.
Even from an early age,
the son of legendary weapons
developer Howard Stark
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.
At age four, he built
his first circuit board.
At age six, his first engine.
And at seventeen, he graduated
Summa Cum Laude from MIT.
Then, the passing of a titan.
Howard Stark's life long friend
and ally Obadiah Stane,
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder.
Untill at age 21,
the prodigal son returns,
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.
With the keys to the kingdom,
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics,
satellite targeting.
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry,
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America and
her interests around the globe.
As liaison to Stark Industries,
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.
He is my friend and
he is my great mentor.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my honor
to present this year's Apogee
Award to Mr. Tony Stark!
Tony?
Thank you, Colonel.
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
This is wonderful.
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.
But if I were Tony...
...I would tell you
how honored I feel,
and what a joy it is to receive
this very prestigious award.
Tony, you know,
the best thing about Tony...
...is also the worst thing -
he's always working.
C'mon!
We should just stay
till the morning.
- You are unbelievable!
- Oh, no. They roped you into this?
Nobody roped me into anything.
But they told me...
that if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you!
That's great. So when do we do it?
One more round. - There you go.
There it is. That was easy.
I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's OK.
Wow, would you look at that?
That's... that's something else.
I don't have any of those
swooping around. All right, ride!
Give me a hand, will you?
OK, you too.
I don't blow on man's hands.
There it is! It's the Lieutenant
Colonel Rhodes' roll, and...
That's what happens.
Worse things have happened,
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?
- This is where I exit.
- Tomorrow don't be late.
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious.
- I know, I know.
Render unto Caesar that which
is Caesar's. There you go.
Mr. Stark! Excuse me!
Mr. Stark!
Christine Everheart,
Vanity Fair magazine.
Can I ask you a couple of
questions? - She's cute.
- She's alright? Hi.
- Hi.
Yeah. Okay, go.
You've been called the Da Vinci of
our time. What do you say to that?
Absolutely ridiculous.
I don't paint.
And what do you say to your other
nickname, the Merchant of Death?
That's not bad.
Let me guess... Berkeley?
Brown, actually.
Well, Ms. Brown.
It's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.
I guarantee you the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,
we'll start making bricks and
beams for baby hospitals.
Rehearse that much?
Every night in front of
the mirror before bedtime.
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you firsthand.
All I want is the serious answer.
Okay, here is serious.
My old man had a philosophy:
"Peace means having a bigger
stick than the other guy."
That's a great line, coming
from a guy selling the sticks.
My father helped defeat Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.
A lot of people, including
your professors at Brown,
would call that being a hero.
And a lot of people would
also call that war-profiteering.
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved by
advancing medical technology?
Or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?
All those breakthroughs:
military funding, honey.
Wow, did you ever lose an hour
of sleep your whole life?
I'd be prepared to
lose a few with you.
Good morning. It's 7 a.m.
The weather in Malibu is 72
degrees with scattered clouds.
The surf conditions are fair
with waist to sholder highlines,
high tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA
Tony? Hey, Tony!
You are not authorized to
access this area. - Jesus!
That's Jarvis, he runs the house.
I've got your clothes here, they've
been dry cleaned and pressed.
And there's a car
waiting for you outside
that will take you
anywhere you'd like to go.
You must be the famous
Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.
After all these years, Tony still
has you picking up the dry cleaning?
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires.
Including occasionally taking out
the trash. Would that be all?
Give me the exploded view.
The compression in cylinder 3
appears to be low.
Note that.
- I'll try again later...
- Please don't turn down my music.
I'll keep you posted.
You are supposed to be half way
around the world right now.
- How did she take it?
- Like a champ.
Might've tried to
hustle me out of here.
Your flight was scheduled to
leave an hour and a half ago.
That's funny... I thought with
it being my plane and all,
that it would just wait
for me to get there.
I need to speak to you about couple of
things before I get you outta the door.
I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the
purpose of having your own plane
if it departs before you arrive?
Larry called, he's got another
buyer for the Jackson Pollock
in the wings, do you
want it, yes or no?
Is it a good representation
of his Spring Period?
No the "Springs" is actually the
neighborhood in East Hampton,
where he lived and worked,
not "spring" like the season.
I think it's a fair example...
I think it's incredibly overpriced.
I need it. Buy it, store it.
Okay... the MI commencement speech.
Is in June... please, don't
harange me about that stuff.
Well, they are haragning me,
so I'm gonna say yes...
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.
What are you trying to get rid
of me for? What, you got plans?
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have
plans on my birthday.
It's your birthday. - Yes.
- I knew that. Already?
Yeah, isn't that strange,
it's the same day as last year.
Well, get yourself something
nice from me. - I already did.
- And?
- Oh, it was very nice.
Very tasteful.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
You're welcome, Ms. Potts.
You're good! I thought
I've lost you back there.
You did, sir.
I took it across Mojave.
- Ah, I gotcha, I gotcha.
What's wrong with you?
- What?
Three hours! - I got caught
doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
Three hours. For three hours,
you got me standing here.
I'm waiting on you now.
Lets go. C'mon.
Wheels up! Rock and roll!
What're you reading?
- Nothing.
C'mon, sourpatch,
don't be mad.
I told you I'm not mad,
I'm indifferent, okay?
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.
- No need to apologize.
- I told him I was sorry but he...
I'm just indifferent right now.
You don't respect yourself,
so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.
- I'm just your babysitter,
and so, when you need your
diaper changed, thank you...
let me know and I'll
get you a bottle, okay?
Hey, heat up the sake, will you?
Thanks for reminding me.
I'm not talking... we're not drinking,
we're working right now.
And you are constitutionally
incapable of being responsible.
It would be irresponsible
not to drink.
I'm just talking about
the night cup. - Hot sake?
- Yes, two please.
- No, just...
I'm not drinking,
I don't want any.
That's what I'm talking about.
When I get up in the morning,
and I'm putting on my uniform,
you know what I recognize?
I see in that mirror that every
person that's got this uniform
will get my back! - Here we
go again. I'm not like you.
No, you don't have to be like me.
But you're more than... yes you are.
Will you excuse me,
I'm a little bit distracted here.
No, you can't be distracted
right now. Listen to me!
BAGRAM AIR BASE,
AFGHANISTAN
General.
Welcome, Mr. Stark.
We look forward to your
weapons presentation.
Is it better to be feared
or respected?
And I say, is it too much
to ask for both?
With that in mind, I humbly
present the crown jewel
of Stark Industries freedom line.
It's the first missile system
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.
They say the best weapon is
one you never have to fire.
I respectfully disagree.
I prefer the weapon you
only have to fire once.
That's how dad did it,
that's how America does it...
and it's worked out
pretty well so far.
Find an excuse to let
one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.
For your consideration,
the Jericho.
We throw one of these in with every
purchase of 500 million or more.
To peace!
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How did it go?
Went great, looks like it's
gonna be an early Christmas.
Hey, way to go, my boy.
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
Why aren't you wearing
those pyjamas I got you?
Good night, Tony.
Hey Tony!
I'm sorry, this is the fun-vee.
The hum-drum-vee is back there.
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
What the hell did you do to me?
What I did?
What I did is to save your life.
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,
and it's headed into
your atrial septum.
Here, wanna see?
I have a souvenir.
Take a look.
I've seen many wounds
like that in my village.
We call them the walking dead.
Because in takes about a week for
the balls to reach the vital organs.
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet.
Hooked up to a car battery.
And it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.
That's right. Smile!
We met once, you know.
At the technical
conference in Bern.
- Don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.
Where are we?
Come on, stand up.
Stand up.
Do as I do.
C'mon, put your hands up.
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?
Do you understand me?
Do as I do.
He says: "Welcome Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer
in the history of America."
He is honored.
He wants you to build a missile.
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.
This one.
I refuse.
Tony!
He wants to know
what you think.
I think he got a lot
of my weapons.
He says they have everything you
need to build a Jericho missile.
He wants you to make
the list of materials.
He says for you to start
working immediately,
and when you're done,
he will set you free.
No, I won't.
No, he won't.
I'm sure they're
looking for you, Stark.
But they will never find
you in these mountains.
Look...
What you just saw...
that is your legacy, Stark.
Your life's work in the
hands of those murderers.
Is that how you want to go out?
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?
Or are you going to do
something about it?
Why should I do anything?
They're gonna kill me, you...
Either way, if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.
Well then... this is a very
important week for you, isn't it?
If this is gonna be my workstation,
I want it well lit,
I want all of these tools.
Welding gear, I don't care if it's
acetylene or propane.
I need a soldering station,
I need helmets,
I need goggles,
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets
of precision tools.
How many languages do you speak?
A lot. But apparently
not enough for this place.
They speak arabic,
urdu, dari, pashto,
mongolian, farsi, russian.
Who are these people?
They are your loyal
customers, sir.
They call themselves
The Ten Rings.
You know, we might
be more productive
if you include me in the
planning proces? - Aha.
Okay. We don't need this.
What is that?
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.
We need at least 1.6,
so why don't you go break
down the other eleven.
What are they doing?
Working.
Careful. Careful, we only
get one shot at this.
Relax, I've steady hands.
Why do you think
you're still alive, huh?
What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.
- Yinsen... nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Wow, that doesn't look
like a Jericho missile.
That's because it is a
miniaturized Arc reactor.
We got a big one powering
my factory at home.
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.
But what could it generate?
If my math is right,
and it always is...
three gigajoules per second.
That could run your heart
for the 50 lifetimes. - Yeah.
Or something big for 50 minutes.
This is our ticket outta here.
- What is it?
'Flying the mountain' look.
Impressive.
Shesh Besh.
Good roll.
Good roll.
You still didn't tell me
where you're from.
I'm from a small
town called Gulmira.
It's actually a nice place.
- You got a family?
- Yes.
And I will see them
when I leave here.
And you, Stark?
Nothing.
No.
So you're a man who has
everything... and nothing.
Doesn't look anything
like the photo.
Maybe he modified it.
- The tail doesn't seem right.
- Well, too bad.
Relax.
The bow and arrow once was the
pinacle of weapons technology.
It allowed the great Genghis Khan
to rule from the Pacific
to the Ukraine.
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great.
And four times the size
of the Roman empire.
But today,
whoever holds the latest
Stark weapons,
rules these lands.
And soon...
...it will be my turn.
Why did you fail me?
We're working on it.
Diligently.
I spared your life.
Is this how you repay me?
It's very complex.
We're trying hard.
On your knees.
You think I'm an idiot?
Tell me the truth.
We are working hard.
Open your mouth.
- What does he want?
- You think I'm a fool?
What is going on?
Tell me the truth.
We are working on Jericho.
What do you want,
a delivery date?
I need him.
He's a good assistant.
You have till tomorrow...
...to assemble my missile.
- Okay?
- Yes.
Can you move?
Say it again.
then 16 steps, left from
the door, four to the right.
Where is Stark?
He was here a moment ago.
Go find him!
Yinsen!
Yinsen!
Stark!
Say something.
He is speaking hungarian,
I don't...
- Speak hungarian.
- Okay...
What do you know?
- How did that work?
- Oh my goodness.
- It worked all right.
- What do I do?
- Let me finish this.
- Finish last powering sequence.
Okay.
Now! Tell me, tell me!
F 11. Tell me when you
see a progress bar.
It should be up right now.
Talk to me, tell me when
you see it. - I have it.
- Press Ctrl + I.
- Got it.
'Enter'. I, 'Enter'. Come over
here and button me up.
They are coming!
Doesn't need to look pretty,
just get it done.
They are coming.
Make sure that checkpoints are
clear before you follow me out, OK?
We need more time.
Okay.
I'm gonna go
buy you some time.
Stick to the plan!
Stick to the plan!
Yinsen!
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!
Stark.
Come on. We gotta go.
Move with me. C'mon, we got
a plan, we need to stick to it.
This was always the plan, Stark.
Come on, you're going to
go see your family again.
My family is dead.
I'm going to see them now, Stark.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I want this.
I want this.
Thank you for saving me.
Don't waste it.
Don't waste your life.
My turn.
Not bad.
How was the fun-vee?
Next time you ride with me, okay?
Watch it coming up here.
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.
Your eyes are red.
Few tears for your
long lost boss?
Tears of joy.
I hate job hunting.
Yeah, vacation's over.
Where to, sir?
Take us to the hospital, please.
- No. - No? Tony...
- You have to go to the hospital.
- I don't have to do anything.
I was in captivity for three months.
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger...
...and the other one...
- That's not going to happen.
It's not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.
Call for a press conference?
What on earth for?
Yeah, Hogan, drive.
Cheeseburger first.
Look at this!
Tony!
I thought you'll be
in a hospital.
Look at you!
Oh, burger, you had
to have a burger.
Did you get me one of those?
There was only one left,
I needed it.
Hey, look who's here!
- Ms. Potts?
- Yes.
May I speak with you
for a moment?
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.
I am not a reporter.
I'm agent Phil Coulson,
with the Strategic
Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.
We've been approached
already by the DOD, FBI, CIA...
We are a separate division.
With a more specific focus.
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about
the circumstances of his escape.
- I'll put something in a book,
shell I? - Thank you.
Hey, would it be alright
if everyone sat down?
Will you sit down? That way
you can see me, and I can...
A little less formal...
What's up with the lovin'?
Don't look at me,
I don't know what he's up to.
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.
I never got to say
goodbye to dad.
I never got to say
goodbye to my father.
There's questions that
I would've asked him.
I would've asked him how he felt
about what his company did...
...if he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.
Or maybe he was every inch of a man
we all remember from the newsreels.
I saw young Americans killed...
...by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.
And I saw that I had
become part of a system
that is comfortable with
zero-accountability.
What happened over there?
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that
I have more to offer
this world than just making
things that blow up.
And that is why, effective
immediately, I'm shutting down
the weapons manufacturing
division of Stark International...
...untill such a time,
as I can decide
what the future of
this company will be,
what direction it should take,
the one I'm comfortable with,
and is consistant with the highest
good of this country and the world.
What we should
take away from this...
...is that Tony's back!
And he's healthier than ever.
We are gonna have a little
internal discussion
and we'll get back to
you with a follow-up.
- Where is he?
- He's inside.
That... that went well.
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?
Your head?
What about my head?
What do you think the over-under
on a stock drop is gonna be?
- Optimistically? 40 Points?
- At minimum.
Tony, we're a
weapons manufacturer.
Obie, I just... I don't want
the body count to be up...
That's what we do. We're iron
mongers, we make weapons.
My name is on facade
of the building.
What we do keeps the world
from falling into chaos.
Not based on what I saw.
We're not doing a
good enough job.
We can do better, we're
gonna do something else.
Oh, like what? You want us
to make baby bottles?
I think we should take another
look into Arc Reactor technology.
Oh, come on. The Arc Reactor,
that's a publicity stunt!
Tony, c'mon! We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.
The Arc was never cost-effective.
We knew that before we built it.
Arc Reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?
- Maybe.
- Am I right?
We haven't had a breakthrough
in that, in what... 30 years.
That's what they say.
Could you have a
lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?
- Never mind who told me.
- Show me.
- Rhodey or Pepper.
- I wanna see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.
It works.
Listen to me, Tony.
We are a team,
do you understand?
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,
like your father and I.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a
heads up, okay? But if I had...
Tony, no more of this
'ready - fire - aim' business.
- Do you understand me?
- That was dad's line.
You gotta let me handle this.
We're gonna have to play whole
different kind of ball now.
We're gonna have to
take a lot of heat.
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.
Stark Industries. I've got one
recommendation. Ready, ready?
Sell, sell, sell!
Abandon ship!
Does the'Hindenburg'
ring any bells?
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!
Pepper!
How big are your hands?
- What?
- How big are your hands?
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.
Hey!
Let's see them.
Show me your hands.
Let's see them.
Oh, wow, they are small.
Very petite, indeed.
I just need your
help for a sec.
Oh my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?
It was, it is now an antique.
This is what will be keeping me
alive for the foreseeable future.
I was swapping it up
for an upgraded unit
and I just ran into a
little... speed bump.
Speed bump?
What's happening?
It's nothing,
it's just a little snag.
There's an exposed wire
under this device
and is contacting a socket wall
and is causing a little
bit of a short circuit.
What do you want me to do?
Put that on the table over
there. That is irrelevant.
I just want you to reach in...
and you're just gonna
gently lift the wire out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it should be fine.
It's just like an operation,
you just don't let it
touch the socket wall.
- What's Operation?
- It's just a game, never mind.
- Just gently lift the wire.
- Okay. - Okay? Great.
You know, I don't think
that I am qualified to do this.
No, no, you're fine.
You're the most capable,
qualified and trustworthy
person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
Cause I really need your help here.
- Oh, there's pus!
- It's not pus.
It's a plasmic discharge, it's from
the device, not from my body.
- It smells!
- Yeah, it does.
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?
- I got it.
Now don't let it touch...
...the sides, that's what I was
trying to tell you before.
Okay, now make sure that
when you pull it out,
you don't pull out the magnet
and the end of it. That was it...
...that you just pulled out.
- Oh God. OK, what do I do?
- Don't put it back in!
- What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac
arrest cause you yanked out...
- What? I thought you said this
was safe! - We gotta hurry.
Take this, you gotta switch,
real quick. - Okay, okay.
Tony, it's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna make this okay.
You gotta touch
that to base plate.
And make sure you...
Was that so hard?
That was fun, right?
I got it, I got it.
Nice.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.
Are you okay?
Don't ever, ever...
...ever ask me to do anything
like that ever again.
I don't have anyone but you.
Are we ready?
What do you want me
to do with this?
That? Destroy it.
Incinerate it.
You don't wanna keep it?
Pepper, I've been
called many things.
Nostalgic is not one of them.
- Would that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That would be all, Ms. Potts.
Hey butterfingers, come here.
What's all this stuff doing
on top of my desk?
That's my phone, that's
a picture of me and my dad...
Right there. In garbage.
All that stuff.
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?
I tell you, in my experience,
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump
a pilot's instinct,
his insight - that ability
to look into a situation
beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome.
Or pilot's judgement.
Colonel, it's... why not
a pilot without a plane?
Look who fell outta the sky!
Mr. Tony Stark.
Speaking about manned
or unmanned,
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong.
It's spring break,
just remember that.
Spring break 1987, that lovely
lady, what was his name?
Was it Ivan?
Don't do that, they'll believe it.
Don't do that.
Give us a couple
of minutes, you guys.
- I'm surprised.
- Why?
I swear I didn't expect to see
you walking around so soon.
I'm doing a little
better than walking.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Rhodey, I'm working
on something big.
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be part of it.
You're about to make a whole lotta
people around here real happy,
cause that little stunt at the
press conference, that was juicy.
This is not for the military.
I'm not... it's different.
What, are you humanitarian
now or something?
I need you to listen to me.
No, what you need is time
to get your mind right.
I'm serious.
It was nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks.
- Jarvis, are you up?
- For you sir, always.
I'd like to open a new
project file, index as: Mark 2.
Shell I store this on the Stark
Industries' central database?
I don't know who to trust
right now. Till further notice,
why don't we just keep everything
on my private server.
Working on a secret
project, are we, sir?
I don't want this winding
up in the wrong hands.
Maybe in mine it could
actually do some good.
Next.
Up.
Not the boot, Dummy, right here.
You got me?
Stay put. Nice.
And you, you're no better
at it at all. Lift... I got it.
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I in your way?
Up.
That's great, don't even move.
You... are a tragedy.
Okay, lets do this right.
Start mark, half meter
back of the center.
Dummy, look for light.
Stand back for fire safety.
You, roll it.
Activate hand controls.
We are gonna start up
nice and easy,
raising 10% thrust capacity
to achieve lift.
And 3, 2, 1.
Up two? Alright, step back.
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?
Yeah, everything's... what?
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great, I'll be right up.
I thought you said you were
done making weapons?
It isn't. This is
a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
How'd it go?
Oh, went that bad huh?
Just because I brought
pizza back from New York
doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
It would've gone better
if you were there.
You told me to lay low and
that's what I've been doing.
I lay low and you
take care of all the...
Hey, c'mon.
In public, the press...
This was a Board of
Directors meeting.
This was a Board of
Directors meeting?
The Board is claiming
a Post Traumatic Stress.
They are filing an injunction.
- A what?
They wanna lock you out.
Why, cause the stocks dip 40 points?
We knew this was gonna happen.
- 56 and a half.
- It doesn't matter.
We own a controlling
interest in the company.
Tony, the Board has rights too.
They are making the case that
you and your new direction
isn't in a company's
best interest.
I'm being responsible.
That's a new direction.
For me... for the company.
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...
- Oh, this is great!
- Oh c'mon, wait! Tony, Tony!
- I'll be in the shop.
- Hey, hey, Tony, listen.
I'm trying to turn
this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.
Something to pitch them.
Let me have the engineers
analyze that, you know,
draw some specs.
- No.
No. Absolutely not.
This one stays with me.
That's it Obie.
Forget it.
Alright, well this
stays with me then.
Go on, here, you can have
a piece. Take two. - Thank you.
Do you mind if I come down there
to see what you're doing?
Good night, Obie.
Day 11, Test 37,
Configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.
Alright, nice and easy.
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.
And 3, 2, 1.
Please don't follow me around
with it either cause I feel
like I'm going to catch on fire
spontaneously. Just stand down.
If something happens,
then come in.
Again, lets bring it up to 2.5%.
Okay, this is where
I don't want to be.
Not the car,
not the car.
It could be worse.
We are fine.
Okay, we are getting there.
Yeah. I can fly.
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.
Engage head up display.
Check.
Import all preferences
from home interface.
Will do, sir.
Alright, what do you say?
I have indeed been uploaded,
sir. We're online and ready.
Start the virtual walkaround.
Importing preferences and
calibrating virtual environment.
- Do a check on control surfaces.
- As you wish.
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.
Ah, yes... tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.
Start listening
the ground control.
Sir, there are still terabytes
of calculations needed
before an actual flight.
- Jarvis...
Sometimes you gotta run
before you can walk.
Ready? And 3, 2, 1.
It feels like a dream.
Alright, lets see what
this thing can do.
What's the SR-71's record?
The altitude record for fixed-wing
flight is 85.000 feet, sir.
Records are made
to be broken. C'mon!
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
build-up of ice occuring.
Keep going!
Higher!
We're iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps.
Jarvis?
C'mon, we gotta break the ice!
Cut power.
Note: main transducer feels
sluggish at plus 40 altitude.
The whole pressurization
is problematic.
I'm thinking 'icy' is
a probable factor.
A very astute observation, sir.
Perhaps if you intend to visit
other planets, we should
improve the exo systems.
Connect to the Cisco, have it
reconfigure the shell metals.
Use the gold-titanium alloy from
the Seraphim tactical satellite.
That should ensure
the fuselage integrity
while maintaining power
-to-weight ratio. Got it?
Yes. Shall I render using
proposed specifications?
Thrill me.
Tonight's red hot,
red carpeted,
right here at the
Disney Concert Hall,
where Tony Stark's
third annual benefit for
the Firefighters Family Fund
has become the place to be...
Jarvis, did we get
an invite from them?
I have no record of
the invitation, sir.
...haven't been seen in public
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.
Some claim he's suffering
from PTS and has been
bed ridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.
The render is complete.
Little ostentatious,
don't you think?
What was I thinking?
You're usually so dicsrete.
Tell you what... throw a little
hot rot red in there.
Yes, that shall help you
keep a low profile.
The render is complete.
Yeah, I like it.
Fabricate it and paint it.
Commensing an
automated assembly.
Estimated completion
time is five hours.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
The weapons manufacturing is...
only a one small part of what
Stark Industries is all about...
- Hey Tony, remember me?
- I sure don't.
You look great, Hef.
What's the world coming to when
a guy's gotta crash his own party?
Look at you!
- Hey, what a surprise!
- I'll see you inside.
Listen, take it slow, alright?
I got the Board where
I really want them.
You got it. Just cabin fever,
I'll just be a minute.
Give me a Scotch,
I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.
- Oh yeah, the guy from the...
Strategic Homeland
Intervention
Enforcement and
Logistics Division.
God, you got... you need
a new name for that.
Yeah, I hear that a lot.
Listen, I know this must be
a trying time for you,
but we need to debrief you.
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions,
and time can be a factor
with these things.
Lets just put something
on the books.
How about the 24th, at 7 p.m.
at Stark Industries?
Tell you what... you got it.
You're absolutely right.
Well... I'm gonna go to my
assistant and we'll make it date.
You look fantastic,
I didn't recognise you.
- What are you doing here?
- Avoiding government agents.
- Are you here by yourself?
- Where'd you get that dress?
It was a birthday present
from you, actually.
- I have great taste.
- Yes.
- You, uh, wanna dance?
- Oh, no, thank you. No.
Am I making you uncomfortable?
No, no.
I always forget to
wear a deodorant,
and dance with my boss
in front of everyone
that I work with,
in a dress with no back.
- You look great, you
smell great. - Oh, God.
But I could fire you,
if that'd take the edge off.
I actually don't think that you
could tie your shoes without me.
- I'd make it a week.
Really? What's your
social security number?
- Five.
- Five?
You're missing just a
couple of digits there.
The other eight? That's why
I got you, for the other eight.
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.
- That was totally wierd.
- Totally harmless.
It was totally not harmless,
by the way.
- Nobody was watching us.
- Everybody who I work with...
I think you lost objectivity.
I think they... we just danced.
No, it was not
just the dance!
You don't understand
because you're you.
And everybody knows exactly who
you are, and how you are with girls.
And all that,
which is completely fine...
But you know, then me, you're
my boss and I'm dancing...
Because it makes me look like...
the one who's trying to...
I just think you're
overstating, that's all.
And we're here, and then I'm...
wearing this ridiculous dress...
And then we were
dancing like that and...
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it.
I would like a
vodka martini, please.
Very dry with olives,
lot of olives,
like at least three olives.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.
Make one of them dirty.
- Well... Tony Stark!
- Oh, hey!
Fancy seeing you here.
- Carrie. - Christine.
- That's right.
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.
Can I at least get
a reaction from you?
Panic. I would say
panic is my reaction.
I was reffering to your
company's involvement
in this latest attrocity.
- They just put my name
on the invitation,
I don't know what to tell you.
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.
I was out of town for a couple
of months, in case you didn't hear.
Is this what you call
accountability?
It's a town called Gulmira.
Heard of it?
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.
Well, I'm not my company.
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?
- What's going on? - Tony, you
can't afford to be this naive.
I was naive before,
when they said:
Here's the line, we don't cross it,
this is how we do business.
If we're double-dealing
under the table... are we?
Let's take a picture.
Come on.
Picture time!
Tony... who do you
think locked you out?
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.
It's the only way
I can protect you.
The fifteen miles hike
to the outskirts of Gulmira
can only be described
as a 'descent into Hell'.
Into a modern day
heart of darkness.
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages
have been driven
from their homes
displaced from their
lands by warlords,
emboldened by
a newfound power.
Villagers have been
forced to take shelter
in whatever ways
that they can find.
In the ruins of other villages
or here, in the remnants of
the old Soviet smelting plant.
Recent violence has been
attributed to a group
of foreign fighters, reffered to
by locals as the Ten Rings.
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.
A mission that can prove fatal to
anyone who stands in their way.
With no political will or
international pressure,
there's very little hope
for these refugees.
Around me, a woman begging
for news on her husband
who was kidnapped
by insurgents.
Either forced to
join their militia...
...to anyone who will stop
a child's simple question:
"Where are my
mother and father?"
There's very little hope
for these refugees,
refugees who can only wonder
who, if anyone, will help.
Faster!
Women on the trucks!
The weapons here!
Abandon houses!
Hurry up!
Hold this rebel!
Put him with the others.
Father!
What the hell is this?
Kill this bastard!
You are incopetent!
Turn your head!
Father!
He is all yours.
AIR BASE EDWARDS,
CALIFORNIA
- What the hell was that?
- Are we clear to go in there?
No, sir. They were
using human shields.
We never got the green light.
Department of State,
they're gonna be all over this.
We got a bogey.
Is CIA on the line?
I got them on line,
they wanna know if it's us.
No, that definitely
is not us, sir.
- It wasn't navy.
- Wasn't marines.
I need answers! Can I please
get eyes on target?
Get me colonel Rhodes
from the Weapons developement
down here now!
We ran an ID check
and crossed reference
with all known databases.
We have nothing.
Any high-altitude surveillance
in the region?
We've got an AWAC and
a Global Hawk in the area.
So this things just
appeared out of nowhere?
How come it didn't
show up on the Radar?
It's got a minimum Radar
cross-section, sir.
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir. It's tiny.
We think it's an
unmanned aerial vehicle.
Colonel, what are we
dealing with here?
I'm gonna make a call.
- Hello?
- Tony?
- Who is this?
- It's Rhodes.
Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.
- Speak up, please.
- What the hell is that noise?
- I'm driving with the top down.
Yeah, well I need
your help right now.
It's funny how
that works, huh?
Yeah, speaking of funny,
we got a weapons depot
that was just blown up
a few cliques from where
you've been held captive.
- Well, that's a hot spot.
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did you job for you.
Why do you sound
out of breath, Tony?
- I was just jogging at the canyon.
- I thought you were driving.
Right, I was driving to the
canyon where I'm gonna jog.
Are you sure you don't have
any tech in that area...
...I should know about?
- Nope.
Bogey spotted!
Okay, good, cause I'm
staring at one right now
and it's about to be
blown to kingdom come
War room, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sight.
- Whiplash One, what is it?
- I've got no idea.
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.
Then you are clear to engage.
Bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!
Incoming missile.
- Flairs!
Wait a second!
Bogey deployed flairs.
Deploy flaps!
Holly... this thing just
drove off the Radar, sir!
Satellite image has been lost.
- No way that's the U.A.V.
- What is it?
I can't see anything.
Whatever it was,
it just bought the farm.
I think bogey has
been handled, sir.
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
- It's who?
I'm sorry, it IS me. You asked
what that was, and it was me.
No, see.. this isn't a game.
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.
You understand that?
It's not a piece of equipment.
I am in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Rhodey, you got anything for me?
Mark your position and
return to base. - Roger that.
On your belly!
It looks like a... man!
Shake him off!
Move, move!
I'm hit!
I'm hit!
Eject! Eject!
Whiplash One down.
- Whiplash 2, do you see a chute?
- Negative! No chute! No chute!
My chute's jammed!
Sir, I've got a visual
on a bogey.
Whiplash 2, reengage. If you
get a clear shot, you take it!
Major, we don't even know what we're
shooting at. Call off the Raptors.
That thing just took out an F-22
inside the legal no-fly zone.
Whiplash 2, if you have
a clear shot, take it.
They've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.
Keep going!
Got a chute!
Got a chute!
- Tony, are you still there?
- Hey, thanks.
Oh my God, you crazy
son of a bitch!
You owe me a plane,
you know that, right?
Yeah, well, technically
he hit me, so...
Now are you gonna come by and
see what I'm working on? - No, no.
The less I know the better.
Now what am I supposed
to tell to the press?
Training excercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?
It's not that simple.
An unfortunate
training excercise
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.
I'm pleased to report that
the pilot was not injured.
As for the unexpected turn of
events on the ground in Gulmira,
it is still unclear who
or what intervened,
but I can assure you that the U.S.
government was not involved.
Oh, it isn't that bad, sir.
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.
Be gentle,
this is my first time.
I designed this to come off.
Please try not to move.
What's going on here?
Let's face it, this is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Welcome.
Compliments of Tony Stark.
If you killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.
You paid us trinkets
to kill a prince.
Show me the weapon.
Come. Leave your
guards outside.
His escape bore
unexpected fruit.
So this is how he did it.
This is only a first crude effort.
Stark has perfected his design.
He has made a
masterpiece of death.
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.
And you dream of Stark's throne.
We have a common enemy.
We are still in business.
I will give you these designs...
...as a gift.
And in return...
...I hope you repay me
with a gift of iron soldiers.
This is the only gift
you will recieve.
Technology.
That's always been your Achilles
heel in this part of the world.
Don't worry. It will only
last for 15 minutes.
That's the least
of your problems.
Bring the armour
and the rest of it.
Alright, lets finish up here.
Set up Sector 16
underneath the Arc reactor.
And I want this dead and masked.
Recruit our top engineers.
I want a prototype right away.
Are you busy?
I need you to go to my office
and hack into the mainframe.
You're gonna retrieve all
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip,
this will get you in.
It's probably under
Executive Files, if not...
they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need to look
for the lowest
numeric heading.
And what do you plan to do
with this information
if I bring it back here?
- Same drill.
They've been dealing under
the table, I'm gonna stop them.
I'm gonna find my weapons
and destroy them.
Tony...
you know that I would
help you with anything,
but I can not help you if you're
gonna start all of this again.
There is nothing except this.
There's no art openings,
there's no benefit,
there's nothing to sign.
There's the next mission,
and nothing else.
Is that so?
Well, then I quit.
You stood by my side
all these years
while I reaped the
benefits of destruction.
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people
that I've put in harm's way,
your going to walk out?
You're gonna kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not gonna be a part of it.
I shouldn't be alive...
unless it was for a reason.
I'm not crazy, Pepper.
I just finally know
what I have to do.
And I know in my heart
that it's right.
You're all I have
too, you know.
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?
You did not tell us that
the target you paid us to kill
was the great Tony Stark.
As you can see,
Obadiah Stane, your deception
and lies will cost you dearly.
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.
So... what are we
gonna do about this?
I know what you're
going through, Pepper.
Ah, Tony. He always gets
the good stuff, doesn't he?
I was so happy...
when he came home. It was like
we got him back from the dead.
And now I realise...
...well, Tony never really
did come home, did he?
He left a part of himself
in that cave.
Breaks my heart.
Well...
He is a complicated person.
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be alright.
You are a very rare woman.
Tony doesn't know
how lucky he is.
Thank you. Thanks.
I gotta get back there.
Is that today's paper?
Yes.
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.
- Of course.
Take care.
Ms. Potts?
We had an appointment.
Did you forget about
our appointment?
Nope. Right now,
come with me.
I'll give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.
We've been working our best.
Absolutely, we're... I'm gonna
have to call you back.
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored
what you've asked us
and it seems as though there's
a little hiccup, actually...
- A hiccup?
- Yes, to power the suit...
sir, the technology actually
doesn't exist. So it's...
Wait, wait, the technology?
William, here is
the technology.
I've asked you to simply
make it smaller.
Okay, sir, that's what
we're trying to do,
but honestly,
it's impossible.
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!
With a box of scraps!
I'm sorry.
I'm not Tony Stark.
Tony?
Tony, are you there?
Breathe.
Easy, easy...
You remember this one, right?
It's a shame the government
didn't approve.
There are so many applications
regarding short-term paralysis.
Ah, Tony.
When I ordered
the hit on you,
I was worried that I was...
...killing the golden goose.
But, you see...
it was just fate
that you survived it,
leaving one last
golden egg to give.
You really think that just
because you have an idea,
it belongs to you?
Your father, he helped to
give us the atomic bomb.
Now what kind of world
would it be today
if he was as selfish as you?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Ah, Tony...
This is your Ninth Symphony.
What a masterpiece!
Look at that.
This is your legacy.
The generation of weapons...
...with this at its heart.
The weapons that will help
stir the world back on course.
With the balance of power
in our hands.
In the right hands.
I wish you could see
my prototype.
It's not as... not as
conservative as yours.
Too bad you had to
involve Pepper in this.
I would've prefered
that she lived.
What do you mean he paid
to have Tony killed?
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...
okay, where is Tony now?
I don't know, he's not
answering his phone.
Please go there and make
sure everything's okay.
Thank you, Rhodey.
I know a shortcut.
Good boy.
Tony?
Tony?
Tony?
Tony!
- Are you okay?
- Where is Pepper?
She's fine. She's with five agents
that are about to arrest Obadiah.
That's not gonna be enough.
Section 16.
Section 16...
There it is.
My key's not working,
it's not opening the door.
Wow, what is that? It's like
a little device, like a thing
that's gonna pick the lock?
-You may wanna take few steps back.
That's the coolest thing I've
ever seen. - Not bad, huh?
Let's do it.
You need me to do
anything else?
Keep the skies clear.
Damn!
Next time, baby.
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.
I thought it'll be bigger.
Take him out!
How do you think the Mark One
chest piece is gonna hold up?
That chest piece was never
designed for sustained flight.
Keep me posted.
- Pepper.
- Tony?
- Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
- Obadiah, he's gone insane.
- I know. Listen!
- You better get outta there!
- He built the suit.
Get outta there, right now!
Where do you think
you're going?
Your services are
no longer required.
Stane!
- I love this suit!
- Put them down.
Collateral damage, Tony.
Defer the power
to chest piece.
Power reduced to 19%.
Lady!
For thirty years,
I've been holding you up.
I built this company
from nothing!
And nothing is gonna
stand in my way.
And least of all, you.
Impressive!
You upgraded your armour.
I've made some
upgrades of my own.
Sir, it appears that
his suit can fly.
Duly noted. Take me
to the maximum altitude.
With only 15% power, the odds
of reaching that altitude...
I know the math! Do it!
Sir, you're not gonna believe this.
That thing is back.
Get me major Allen.
Scramble the jets!
Not necessary, people,
just the training exercise.
- 13% power, sir.
- Climb!
-11%.
- Keep going!
- 7% power. - Just leave it on
the screen, stop telling me.
You had a great idea, Tony,
but my suit is more
advanced in every way!
How'd you solve
the icing problem?
Icing problem?
Might want to look into it.
We are now running on
emergency backup power.
- Potts!
- Tony!
Oh my God, are you okay?
I'm almost dead of power,
I gotta get out of this thing.
I'll be right there.
- Nice try.
Weapons status?
Repulsors are off line.
Flairs!
Very clever, Tony.
- Potts.
- Tony!
This isn't working, we're gonna
have to overload the reactor
and blast the roof.
- How are you gonna do that?
You're gonna do it.
Go to the central console,
open up bolt of circuits.
When I clear the roof
I'll let you know
and you're gonna hit
the master bypass button.
That's gonna fry
everything up here.
Okay, I am going in now.
Make sure you wait till I clear
the roof, I'll buy you some time.
This looks important.
I never had a taste
for this sort of thing,
but I must admit, I'm
deeply enjoying the suit.
You finally outdid
yourself, Tony.
It would've made
your father proud.
It's ready, Tony!
Get off the roof!
Tony!
How ironic, Tony!
Trying to free
the world of weapons,
you gave it
the best one ever!
- Pepper!
- And now...
I'm gonna kill you with it!
You ripped up my
targeting system.
- Hit the button!
- You told me not to!
Hold still, you little prick.
- Just do it!
- You'll die!
Push it!
Tony!
We've all received
the official statement
of what occured at
Stark Industries last night.
There have been unconfirmed
reports that a robotic prototype
malfunctioned and caused
damage to the Arc reactor.
"Iron Man", that's kinda catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.
It's not technically accurate,
since it's a gold-titanium alloy,
but it's kinda attractive
name anyway.
Here is your alibi.
- Okay.
- You were on your yacht.
We told Pepper to put
you in Avalon all night
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.
I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me,
alone on the island.
That's what happened.
Just read it word for word.
There's nothing
about Stane here.
That's been handled.
He's on vacation.
Small aircraft have such
a poor safety record.
What about this whole story
that it's a body guard?
He's my body... ?
That's kinda flimsy.
This isn't my first rodeo,
Mr. Stark.
Just stick to the official statement
and soon this will all be behind you.
You've got 90 seconds.
Oh, agent Coulson.
I just wanted to say thank you
very much for all of your help.
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
Right.
- Lets get the show on the road.
- You know, it's actually...
...not that bad... even I
don't think I'm Iron Man.
- You're not Iron Man.
- Yeah I am.
- You're not.
- Suite yourself.
If I were Iron Man,
I'd have this girlfriend
who knew my true identity.
She'd be a wreck.
She'd always be worrying
that I was gonna die,
and yet proud of a man
I become. She'd be...
wildly conflicted, which
would only make her more...
crazy about me. Tell me you
never think about that night?
- What night?
- You know.
Are you talking about...
the night that we danced,
and went up to the roof...
and then...
you went downstairs
to get me a drink, and you...
left me there by myself?
Is that the night
you're talking about?
I thought so.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that'd be all, Ms. Potts.
And now Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.
He will not be taking
any questions, thank you.
It's been a while since
I was in front of you,
I figure I'll stick
to the cards this time.
There's been speculation that
I was involved in the events
that occured on a freeway
and the rooftop...
I'm sorry Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit,
that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that...
- I know that it's confusing...
It is one thing to question
the official story,
and another entirely
to make wild accusations
or insinuate that
I'm a superhero.
- I never said you're
a superhero. - You didn't?
Well, good, because that
would be outlandish and...
...fantastic.
I'm just not the hero type,
clearly. With this...
long list of character defects
and all the mistakes I've made,
largely in public.
- Just stick to the cards.
- Yeah, okay.
The truth is...
I am Iron Man.

Long ago that I'm
before Qty. but no evidence exists.
It has been said about my
participation on the events that occurred
- On the street ...
- Sorry, sir, but do not believe that the use
a bodyguard
be more appropriate.
Yes.
And if more
weapons in it.
One thing's have the official version and others
thing to do is point the finger
and say that I am a
kind of superhero.
You have to accept that I have
the kind of hero.
This long list of character defects
and the mistakes I made in public.
The point is ...
I am a man of iron.
- Am I wrong.
- Only some rest you will recover.
I can not go.
I'm wrong.
ARCA REACTOR
... We are in 4500 meters
we are about the area.
Nice to see them.
The late.
And I did.
I already did.
I'm not saying that the world has its
the longest period of uninterrupted peace
thanks to me.
I'm not saying I
spent in my captivity.
Something I had never
personified as good in history.
I'm not saying that our Uncle Sam is
not here anymore and rests in its mln.
Enjoying this because I
could find someone who is
Then, out and wins
my best day.
Thanks, do not talk about me.
I'm not talking about you
I'm not talking about us, talk
a legacy.
I speak of what we decided
leave for future generations.
That's why the entire year
and for the first time since 64.
The most brilliant men and women
nations and the corporate world
will pool resources and give us your
collective vision of how to build a better future.
Not for us, so as to
finish and I can tell you otherwise.
Welcomed the project.
And now I present to a client that is
special and will talk about it.
I ask for applause
for my father Howard.
Anything is possible with technology.
Better life, good health.
And for the first time in history
of humanity, the ability
world peace.
On behalf of everyone here I STARK INDUSTRY
personally presented the city's future.
The technology lets

TOXICITY 200%
Soon the technology will affect
how they live their daily lives.
Nothing more tedious, leave this
time for other activities.
And enjoy the sweet life.
That is Expo Stark welcome.
It is fully active
exhibition is the inauguration
and everyone tries to leave the scene.
If they can not come, do not worry
lasts all year.
You may be here in the halls stock with
inventions that come from all over the world.
Ready here we go.
Hello friends, thank you
for coming. That's cute.
Hello
What is this?
On one side you.
- Wow.
- Your autograph.
Good.
- EL is Aby.
- The teacher today.
Call me to talk, call me.
I will.
Hey friend, this is the best.
Many more opportunities.
- Many hands really.
- It was not so bad.
- If you came out perfect.
- What Car? It is the latest model.
- And it comes with the car?
- Well, I hope so.
- Hello
- Hello
- And you are?
- I'm Poli.
- This is weird.
- It's a great pleasure.
I drive, do you mind?
Where are you?
- From Redcord.
- What are you doing here?
- Buscandote.
- So here I am.
- And then?
- Bring subpoenas.
- Do not receive service.
- Yes, I'm not.
- I maintain it.
- Having been summoned to appear in
Services Committee
tomorrow at 9:00.
- So you're a cop?
- I am the federal police.
- And bring your plate?
- You like?
Yes.
So how is Washington?
It is 400 km.
Mr. Stark can continue
question, Mr. Stark, please.
- Tell me baby.
- Can I ask your attention?
With pleasure.
- True or not have a weapon specialist.
- Not so.
- It is not.
- Not so.
Depends on how you define
weapon.
- The weapon of Iron Man
- My invention is not well described.
- How would you describe yourself?
- I would describe how to define what is truly Mr.
- What is this?
- An advanced prostheses.
- This is the best description I can do.
- It is a weapon, Mr. Stark hate to tell you ...
- If the Sub-Prior was serious, that ...
- No, my priority is that the gun's iron man
delivery to the people of Brazil
E.U.A..
So, forget it.
I am Iron Man suit and I are one, real
delivering Iron Man suit that I surrender.
Which is similar to slavery, depending
about the same state prostitution.
- He will not have Mr.
- Look, I'm not an expert.
In prostitution, as is thought
a Senator, please.
I am not a weapons expert.
We brought a weapons expert.
I would call our Dustin Hammer
today's top weapons contractor.
Let it be recorded that I see
Mr. Hammer entered the chamber.
And I wonder when they will arrive
weapons expert who speaks.
Actually yes, I'm not an expert,
is you.
You are the example.
Senator, if I can.
Can not be an expert, you know
Who was the expert?
Who do you think?
Haward Stark.
A father to us. E
for the entire military industry Tony.
But it must be clear that not dajar
flowers spread, it was a lion.
All we know why we are here in these six
months Tony Stark has created a weapon
with many possibilities and
He insists it is a shield.
He Confinenme
say, as I know cringe.
As I like to feel
insurance, actually, yes.
I do not
lock the house.
But never where we live
a world full of threats.
When Mr. Stark does not
have the ability to predict.
Thank you, God bless
Iron Man and the country.
Very well said Mr. Hammer.
The committee now invites the lieutenant
Colonel James Rhodes for the camera.
Rhodey "?
Friend, do not wait
see it here.
- Tony, and accept what happens with a vine?.
- Ok, I do not believe it.
I have here a complete report of the gun
Iron Man, compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
Colonel registration can
read section 4 on page 57.
Specific request you to read
parts of my report of the senator?
If Mr.
I was told it was going to testify
more comprehensive and detailed.
- There were changes, I understand Mr.
- Tell me to read numbers out of context does not reflect ...
The colonel read it I understand.
Thank you.
Very good.
Mr. and does not operate in any one branch
The government is a possible Iron Man
Risk to the safety of the nation
and their interests, but after I summarize
that the benefits of Iron Man
far outweigh its potential risks.
- Colonel Enough.
- And he gives Mr. Stark in jail ...
I do not like the idea but think
became secretary of defense.

And this is indeed ajente
Romanoff and a report is yours.
Read it.
Mr Personality Summary
Stark is obsessive-compulsive disorder.
In my defense, it was last week.
Obvious destructive tendencies,
going to die, please.
And all I have.
Classic case "Narsizismo?
Right.
Another is here, the evaluation of recruitment
for the project Avenger, Iron Man himself.
- I have to think about it.
- Continued.
Stark Tony, is not recommended?
I do not see the point, as
approved and disapproved?
I have a new heart, I am
be good with Peppers.
I have a semi-stable relationship.
What makes us think that this operation
is that only you will use a consultant.
They have to be paid.
Although this may save salary
If instead you do me a favor.
They're coming and I'll be decorated Rhodey
Washington y. ..
Nobody comes.
I'll see what I can do.
It is a pleasure and an honor
deliver these two medals to Lt. Col.
Mr. James Rhodes and Tony Stark.
Who is a great ...
A great national treasure.
Thank you for your lieutenant colonel
excepsional action on the field.
- He deserves it.
- Thanks.
Thanks to Mr. Stark excepsional
performance.
He deserves it.
Sorry.
With his career just a painful sting.
Get ready for shooting.

The Tesseract has awakened.
It is on a neutral world, a human world.
They wield its power,
but our ally knows it's working, so that they never will learn.
He's ready to lead, and our force, our Chitauri will follow.
The world will be his and the universe yours.
And the humans, what can they do, but burn.
How bad is it?
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hour ago.
NASA didn't authorize Selvig to pull the test phase.
He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement
It just turned itself on?
What are the engine levels now?
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered the evac.
How long to get everyone out?
Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
Do better.
Sir, evacuation maybe futile.
We should tell them to go back to sleep?
If we can't control the Tesseract's energy,
there may not be a minimum safe distance.
I need you to make sure that phase
Sir, is that really a priority right now?
Until such time as the world ends,
we will act as though it intends to spin on.
Clear out the tech below. Every piece of phase 2 on a truck and gone.
Yes, sir. Come with me.
Talk to me, Doctor.
- Director.
- Is there anything we know for certain?
- Tesseract is misbehaving.
- Is that supposed to be funny?
No, it's not funny at all.
The Tesseract is not only active, she's...misbehaving.
-How soon until you pull the plug?
She's an energy source.
If we turn off the power, she turns it back on.
- If she reaches peak level...
- We've prepared for this, doctor.
- Harnessing energy from space.
- We don't have the harness.
Our calculations are far from complete.
Now she's throwing off interference, radiation
Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.
That can be harmful.
Where's Agent Barton?
The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
Agent Barton, report to me.
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things.
- I can see better from a distance.
- Are you seeing anything that might
- set this thing off?
- Doctor, it's spiking again.
No one come or gone.
It's oven is clean.
No contacts, no I.M.'s.
If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.
- At this end?
- A cube of space, one end of the door.
Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.
Sir, please put down the spear!
You have a heart.
Please don't.
- I still need that.
- This doesn't have to get any messier.
Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else.
I am Loki of Asgard,
- and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
- Loki, brother of Thor?
We have no quarrel with your people.
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
- You planning to step on us?
- I come with glad tidings,
- of a world made free.
- Free from what?
Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
Once you accept that, in your heart...
You will know peace.
Yeah, you say peace, I kind of
think you mean the other piece.
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.
This place is about to blow
Drop a hundred feet of raw material,
he means to bury us.
- Like The Pharaohs of Odin.
- He was right.
He's right, the portal is collapsing in on itself.
You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
Drop him.
Need these vehicles.
- Who's that?
- He didn't tell me.
Hill, do you copy? Barton is....
He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
ets go, no no no.. leave leave, go.
We cleared upstairs, sir.
We need to go.
Director? Director Fury , do you copy?
The Tesseract is with the hostile force.
I have men down. Hill?
A lot of men still under,
don't know how many survivors.
Sound the general call,
I want every living soul not needing rescue
- looking for that briefcase.
- Roger that.
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a level seven.
As of right now, we are at war.
What do we do?

I don't give everything.

- Natasha.
Barton's been compromised.
Let me put you on hold.
- Where's Barton now?
- We don't know.
- But he's alive.
- We think so.
I'll brief you on everything when you get back.
But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts
me about as far as he can throw me.
No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
Oh, God.
- Do not come here!
- Who are you?
Go away. Here is a disease.
Are you a doctor?
My father did not wake up!
Body heat, and he
make noise, but did not open his eyes.
A slower rate.
My father ...
And when they?
Please...
Should have got paid up front, Banner.
You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress,
you picked a hell of a place to settle.
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
-Then what is it? Yoga?
ou brought me to the edge of the city, smart.
I uh...assume the whole place is surrounded?
Just you and me.
And your actress buddy, is she a spy too?
Do you start that young?
- I did.
- Who are you?
Natasha Romanoff.
Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.
No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
SHIELD. How did they find me?
We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance,
even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.
- Why?
- Nick Fury seems to trust you.
But now I need you to come in.
- What if I say no?
- I'll persuade you.
And what if the...other guy says no?
You've been more than a year without an incident.
I don't think you wanna break that streak.
I don't get every time what I want.
Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.
- Well, those I actively try to avoid.
- This is the
Tesseract.
It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
- What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
- Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken.
It omits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace.
There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do.
If there was, that's where I'd be.
- So Fury isn't after the monster?
- Not that he's told me.
And he tells you everything?
- Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
- He needs me in a cage?
- No one's gonna put you in a...
- Stop lying to me!
I'm sorry, that was mean.
I just wanted to see what you'd do.
Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that,
and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay?
Natasha.
Stand down. We're good here.
Just you and me?
This is out of line, Director.
You're dealing with forces you can't control.
You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight?
Did you feel an over abundance of control?
You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
Not Asgard. Loki.
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one? His brother.
Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile.
But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help either.
It's up to us.
Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2,
- it was designed for exactly...
- Phase 2 isn't ready, our enemy is.
- We need a response team.
- The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
- This isn't about The Avengers.
- We have seen the list.
We're running the world's greatest
covert security network
and you're gonna leave the fate of
human race to a handful of freaks.
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.
We need a response team.
These people may be isolated, unbalanced even,
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.
- You believe?
- War isn't won by sentiment, Director.
No, it's won by soldiers.
There's not enough time. I'm gotta
pull into the water.
- You wont be alone.
- .Oh God.
This guy is still alive.
Trouble sleeping?
I slept for 70 years, Sir.
I think I've had my fill.
Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.
I went under, the world was at war,
I wake up, they say we won.
They didn't say what we lost.
We've made some mistakes along the way.
Some very recently.
- You here with a mission, sir?
- I am.
- Trying to get me back in the world?
- Trying to save it.
Hydra's secret weapon.
Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you.
He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to
unlimited sustainable energy.
That's something the world sorely needs.
- Who took it from you?
- He's called Loki.
He's not from around here.
There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in.
The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.
Ten bucks says you're wrong.
There's a debriefing package waiting
for you back at your apartment.
Is there anything you can tell us
about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
You should have left it in the ocean.
You're good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.
You disconnected the transition lines?
Are we off the grid?
Stark Towers is about to become a
beacon of self sustaining clean energy.
Wow, so maybe our reactor takes over
and it actually works?
I assume. Light her up.
- How does it look?
- Like Christmas, but with more...me.
Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign.
You need to do some press.
I can do some more tomorrow,
I'm working on the zoning for the next billboards.
Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
Enjoy the moment.
I remember.
Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.
I'm not in. I'm actually out.
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.
Levels are holding steady...I think.
Of course they are, I was directly involved.
Which brings me to my next question.
- How does it feel to be a genius?
- Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?
What do you mean? All this, came from you.
No. All this, came from that.
Give yourself some credit, please.
Stark Tower -
Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself, twelve percent of the credit.
- Twelve percent?
- An argument can be made for fifteen.
- Twelve percent for my baby?
- Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
- My private elevator.
- You mean our elevator?
It was teeming with sweaty workmen.
I'm going to pay for that comment about
percentages in some subtle way later on, aren't I?
Not gonna be that subtle.
I'll tell you what. Next building
is gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
- On the lease.
- Call your mom, can you bunk over?
Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid
my protocol's are being overwritten.
Stark, we need to talk.
You have reached the life model
decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
- This is urgent.
- Then leave it urgently.
- Security breach. That's on you.
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.
- Phil.
- I can't stay.
- Uh...his first name is Agent.
- Come on in, we're celebrating.
- Which is why he can't stay.Soon as possible.
- I don't like being handed things
- That's alright, cause I love to be handed things.
So, let's trade.
Thank you.
Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
- This isn't a consultation.
- Is this about The Avengers?
- Which I...I know nothing about.
- The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought.
- And I didn't even qualify.
- I didn't know that either.
Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self obsessed, don't play well with others.
- That I did know.
- This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
- Whatever. Miss Potts, got a sec?
- You know, I thought we were having a moment.
- I was having twelve percent of a moment.
This seems so serious, Phil's pretty shaken.
- How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
- What is all this?
This is uh...
This.
- I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.
- Tomorrow.
You have homework. You have a lot of homework.
Well, what if I didn't?
If you didn't?
You mean if you finished?
Then ...
Square deal. It's the last date.
Work hard.
- Do you drive past the airport, by chance?
- I can drop you.
Oh, fantastic. Does the cellist
You? Is it true relationship?
- He moved back to Portland.
- What?
We are a forty-minute
from the base, sir.
So this Dr. Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?
A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero.
Banner thought gammer radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.
- Didn't really go his way, did it?
- Not so much.
When he's got that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
He's like a smart person.
I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially.
I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping.
I mean, I was...I was present while you were unconscious from the ice.
You know, it's really, it's just a...just a huge honor to have you on board.
- Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
- Oh, you are. Absolutely.
Uh...we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.
The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little...old fashioned?
Everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light,
people might just need a little old fashioned.
- The Chitauri grow restless.
- Let them grow restless.
- I will lead them in the glorious battle.
- Battle? Against a meagre might of earth?
- Glorious, not lengthy.
If your force is as formidable as you claim.
You question us?
Question him?
He who put the scepter in your hand?
Who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose?
When you were cast out, defeated!
I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard. Betrayed.
Your ambition is little and full of childish need.
We look beyond the earth to great worlds
The Tesseract will avail.
You don't have the Tesseract yet.
I don't threaten.
But until I open the doors,
until your force is mine to command, you are the wars.
- You will have your war as guardian.
If you fail, -
if the Tesseract is kept from us,
there will be no realm, no barren moon,
no crevasse where I can't find you.
You think you know pain?
You will receive something sweet as pain.
- Get your captain equipment.
- All right.
Agent Romanoff , he's Captain Rogers.
- They need you on the bridge.
- See you there.
There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice.
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.
Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
- Trading Cards?
- They're vintage, he's very proud.
Dr. Banner.
Oh, yeah. Hi.
- They told me you'd be coming.
- Word is you can find the cube.
- Is that the only word on me?
- Only word I care about.
Must be strange for you, all of this.
- Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
- Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute.
It's gonna get a little hard to breath.
Is this is a submarine?
Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container?
Oh, no. This is much worse.
- All engine operating.SHEILD
emergency protocol,1 9 3.6 in effect. We're in, sir.
- Good.
- Lets vanish.
- Engage retro reflection panels.
- Reflection panels engaged.
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor, thank you for coming.
- Thanks for asking nicely.
- So, uh...how long am I staying?
- Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.
Where are you with that?
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible camera on the planet.
Cell phones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite,
- it's eyes and ears for us.
- That's still not gonna find them in time.
You have to narrow the field.
How many spectrometers do you have access to?
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know,
tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof
and calibrate them for gamma rays.
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition.
At least we could rule out a few places.
- Do you have somewhere for me to work?
- Agent Romanoff,
would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please.
You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.
- Put over there.
- Is this the stuff you need?
- Yeah, Iridium.
It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons.
- It's very hard to get hold of
- Specially if SHIELD knows you need it.
Well, I didn't know!
The Tesseract is showing me so much.
It's...it's more than knowledge, it's truth.
I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?
- My next target.
- Tell me what you need.
I need a distraction.
And an eyeball.
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.
No, no. It's fine.
It's a vintage set.
It took me a couple of years to collect them all.
Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but...
We got a hit. Sixty seven percent match.
Weight, cross match, seventy nine percent.
- Location?
- Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Canning Strasse.
- He's not exactly hiding.
- Captain,
you're up.
Kneel before me.
I said.
Kneel!
Is not this simpler?
Is this not your natural state?
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,
that you crave subjugation.
The bright lure of freedom diminishes
your life's joy in a mad scramble for power,
and identity.
You were made to be ruled.
In the end, you will always kneel.
Not to men like you.
- There are no men like me.
- There are always men like you.
Look to your elder, people.
Let him be an example.
You know, the last time I was in Germany
and saw a man standing above everybody else,
we ended up disagreeing.
I'm not the one who's out of time.
Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
Kneel.
Not today!
The guy's all over the place.
Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
Make your move, Reindeer names.
Good move.
- Mr Stark.
- Captain.
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not a word.
Just get in here.
We're low on time.
- I don't like it.
- What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
I don't remember it being that easy.
This guy packs a wallop.
Still, you were pretty spry, for an older fellow.
- What's your thing? Pilates?
- What?
It's like calisthenics.
You might have missed a couple things,
you know, doing time as a Capsicle.
- Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
- Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.
Where's this coming from?
What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
I'm not overly fond of what follows.
- Now there's that guy.
- Another Asgardian?
- Think the guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.
If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
- Stark, we need a plan of attack.
- I have a plan. Attack.
- I'd sit this one out, Cap.
- I don't see how I can.
These guys come from legends, they're basically Gods.
There's only one God, ma'am.
And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
- Where's the Tesseract?
- I missed you too.
- Do I look to be in a gaming mood?
- Oh, you should thank me.
With the Bifrost gone, how much dark energy did the
All-Father have to muster to conjure you here?
Your precious earth.
I thought you dead.
Did you mourn?
- We all did.
Our father...
- Your father.
He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?
We were raised together.
We played together, we fought together.
- Do you remember none of that?
- I remember a shadows.
living in the shade of your greatness.
I remember you tossing me into an abyss.
- I who was and should be king!
- So you take the world I love as recompense for
your imagined slights?
No, the earth is under my protection, Loki.
And you're doing a marvelous job with that.
The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you ideally threat.
- I mean to rule them. That's why should I not...
- Think yourself above them.
- Well, yes.
- Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother.
A throne would suit you ill.
I've seen worlds you've never known about.
I have grown, Odin's son, in my exile.
I have seen the true power of the Tesseract. And when I wield it...
Who showed you this power?
Who controls the would be king?
- I am the king!
- Not here!
You give up the Tesseract!
You give up this poisonous dream!
You come home.
I do not have it.
You need the cube to bring me home,
but I've sent it off. I know not where.
You listen well, brother.
I'm listening.
- Do not touch me again.
- Then don't take my stuff.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Uh...Shakespeare in the park.
Doth mother know, you weareth her drapes?
This is beyond you, metal man.
Loki will face Asgardian justice.
He gives up the cube and he's all yours. Until then,
stay out of the way.
Tourist.
Okay.
How about that.
Thats enough!
- Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.
- I've come here to put and end to Loki's schemes!
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.
Uh...yep! No! Bad call! He loves his hammer!
You want me to put the hammer down?
Are we done here?
In case it's unclear, you try to escape,
you so much as scratch that glass.
Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap.
You get how that works?
Ant.
Boot.
It's an impressive cage.
Not built, I think, for me.
Built for something a lot stronger than you.
Oh, I've heard.
The mindless beast, makes play to be the man.
How desperate are you? You call on these lost creatures to defend you.
How desperate am I?
You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.
You talk about peace and you kill
cause it's fun.
You have made me very desperate.
You might not be glad that you did.
Ooh. It burns you to come so close.
To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power.
And for what?
A world for all mankind to share,
- and then to be reminded what real power is.
\- Well let me know if real power will want some magazine or something./
- He really grows on you, doesn't he?
- Loki's gonna drag this out.
- So, Thor, what's his play?
- He has an army called the Chitauri,
that none of Asgard nor any world know.
He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth.
- Return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
- An army,
- from outer space.
- So he's building another portal.
- That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
- Selvig?
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.
Loki has him under some kind of spell,
- along with one of ours.
- I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
- He's not leading an army from here.
- I don't think we should be focusing on Loki.
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.
I don't care how you speak.
Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.
He killed eighty people in two days.
- He's adopted.
- I think its about the mechanics.
- Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?
- It's a stabilizing agent.
Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
No hard feelings Point Break, you've got a mean swing.
Also, it means the portal can open as wide,
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.
That man is playing gallaga.
Thought we wouldn't notice, but we did.
- How does Fury even see these?
- He turns.
Sounds exhausting.
The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.
Only major component he still needs is a power source.
A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.
When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
Last night.
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the Extraction Theory papers.
Am I the only one who did the reading?
Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
He got to heat the cube to a hundred and
twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
stabilize the quantum tunnelling effect.
Well, if he could do that he could achieve
Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.
Finally, someone who speaks English.
- Is that what just happened?
- It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled.
And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control
and turn into an enormous green rage monster.
- Thanks.
- Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube.
- I was hoping you might join him.
- Let's start with that stick of his
It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.
I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube.
And I'd like to know how Loki used it to
turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.
- Monkeys? I do not understand.
- I do.
- I understood that reference.
- Shall we play it, Doctor?
- This way, Sir.
The gamma readings are definitely
consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract.
- But it's gonna take weeks to process.
- If we bypass their mainframe
and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster,
we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.
All I packed was a tooth brush.
You know, you should come by Stark Towers sometime.Top ten floors, all R and D.
- You'd love it, it's candy land.
- Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I
kind of broke Harlem.
Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension.
No surprises.
- Nothing?
- Are you nuts?
You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret?
- Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny.
- No offense, Doctor.
- No, it....it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't
- handle pointy things.
- You're tiptoeing, big man.
- You need to strut.
- And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.
You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now?
Why not before? What isn't he telling us.
I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
- You think Fury's hiding something?
- He is a spy.
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets.
It's bugging him too, isn't it?
- Uh, I just wanna finish my work here and...
- Doctor?
A world for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.
- I heard it.
- Well, I think that was meant for you.
Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.
The Stark Tower? That big ugly......, building in New York?
It's powered by Stark Reactors, self sustaining energy source.
- That building will run itself for what, a year?
- That's just the prototype.
I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
So why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project?
I mean, What are they doing in the energy business in the first place?
I should probably look into that once my decryption programme finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.
- I'm sorry, did you say.....?
- Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge.
In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.
- Blueberry?
- Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?
An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically not possible.
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed.
We have orders, we should follow them.
Following is not really my style.
And you're all about style, aren't you?
Of the people in this room, which one is; a-wearing a spangly outfit, and b- not of use?
Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?
Just find the cube.
That's the guy my dad never shut up about?
Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
The guy's not wrong about Loki, he does have the jump on us.
What he's got is an acme dynamite kit.
It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does..
And I'll read all about it.
Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
I'm exposed, like a nerve.
- It's a nightmare.
- You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel,
trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.
This stops it. This little circle of light.
It's part of me now, not just armor.
- It's a terrible privilege.
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.
- It's different.
Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gammer exposure should have killed you.
So you're saying that the Hulk,
the other guy, saved my life?
That's nice.
It's a nice sentiment.
Save it for what?
I guess we'll find out.
- You may not enjoy that.
- You just might.
As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster.
We've got an excellent observatory in Traunsee.
She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday.
Handsome fee, private plane, very remote.
- She'll be safe.
- Thank you.
It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig.
I dread what he plans for him once he's done.
- Erik is a good man.
- He talks about you a lot.
You changed his life.
- You changed everything around here.
- They were better as they were.
We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we.
We come here battling like Bilchsteim.
- Like what?
- Bilchsteim. You know; huge, scaly, big antlers.
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.
They are repulsive, and
they trample everything in their path.
When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price.
And now again,
n my youth I courted war.
War hasn't started yet.
You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield,
it's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance upon me.
There's no pain that would prise his need from him.
A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.
- What are you asking me to do?
- I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?
Loki is a prisoner.
Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?
There's not many people that can sneak up on me.
-But you figured I'd come after.
After whatever tortures Fury can concoct,
you would appear as a friend,
as a balm.
- And I would cooperate.
- I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.
I'd say I've expanded his mind.
And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain.
What happens to his mind?
- Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
- Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
Tell me.
Before I worked for SHIELD, I
I made a name for myself.
I have a very specific skillset.
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.
I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way.
Agent Barton was sent to kill me,
he made a different call.
And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
- I'll not let you out.
- Ah, no. But I like this
Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?
Regime's fall everyday.
I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian,
Or I was.
- And what are you now?
- It's really not that complicated.
I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.
Can you?
Can you wipe out that much red?
Drakoff's daughter?
Sao Paulo?
The hospital file?
Barton told me everything.
Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red,
and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?
This is the basest sentimentality.
This is a child at prayer.
Pathetic.
You lie and kill
in the service of liars and killers.
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,
something that makes up for the horrors.
But they are a part of you,
and they will never go away.
I won't barter Barton! Not until I make him kill you.
Slowly, intimately, in every way he knows you fear.
And then he'll wake just long enough to see his good work,
and when he screams I'll split his skull
This is my bargain, you mewling quin!
You're a monster.
Oh, no.
You brought the monster.
- So, Banner? That's your play?
- What?
Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way.
Set the door locked.
Thank you, for your cooperation.
- What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
- kind of been wondering the same thing about you
- You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
- We are, the model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now.
When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.
And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.
What is Phase 2?
Phase 2 is SHIELD used the cube to make weapons.
-Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow for me.
-Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract.This does not
\ - mean that we're./
- I'm sorry, Nick.
What were you lying?
- I was wrong, Director. The world hasn't changed a bit.
- Do you know about this?
- You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?
- I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.
- Loki's manipulating you.
- And you've been doing what exactly?
- You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
- Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.
I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
Because of him.
- Me?
- Last year earth had a visitor from another planet
who had a grudge mass that levelled a small town.
We learned that not only are we not alone,
but we are hopelessly, hilariously
- out gunned.
- My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
But you're not the only people out there, are you?
And, you're not the only threat.
The world's filling up with people who can't be matched,
- they can't be controlled.
- Like you controlled the cube?
You're work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.
It is the signal to all the realms that the
earth is ready for a higher form of war.
- A higher form?
- You forced our hand.We had to come up with something.
A nuclear deterrent.
cause that always calms everything right down.
Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?
- I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep...
- Wait, Wait, Hold on. How is this now about me?
- I'm sorry, isn't everything?
- I thought humans were more evolved than this.
- Excuse me, did we come to your planet and blow stuff up?
- We can..
- You speak of control, yet you court chaos.
- It's his M.O., isn't it?
I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos.
We're...we're a time-bomb.
- You need to step away.
- Why shouldn't they guy let off a little steam?
- You know damn well why! Back off!
- Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.
Yeah, big man in a suit of armor.
- Take that off, what are you?
- Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.
I've seen the footage.
The only thing you really fight for is yourself.
You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play,
to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
I think I would just cut the wire.
Always a way out.
You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero
A hero, like you?
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.
Put on the suite, let's go a few rounds.
- You people are so petty, and tiny.
- Yes, right.
- Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his
- Where? You're renting my room.
- The cell was just...
- In case you needed to kill me.
but you can't! I know, I tried.
I got low,
I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out.
So I moved on, I focused on helping other people.
I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show.
and put everyone here at risk. You wanna know my secret,
Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?
Dr. Banner.
put down the scepter.
All right.
- Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my party trick after all.
- Located the Tesseract?
- I can get there faster.
- The Tesseract belongs on Asgard,
- no human is a match for it.
- You're not going alone!
You gonna stop me?
Put on the suit, let's find out.
- I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
- Put on the suit.
Oh, my God.
- Put on the suit!
- Yep.
- Hill!
- Its a detonation. Number three engines is down.
-We're been hit.
-Fire engines.
- Talk to me.
- Turbine looks mostly intact, -
but it is impossible to get out there and repair when we already there.
If we lose one of engine we wont be.
- Someone gonna get outside and patch the engine.
- Stark, did you capy that?
- I'm on it.
Okay.
You okay right?
Keep that engine down.
Attention.wait the cameras going dark.
Stay close.
Level four.
Engine three. I'll meet you there.
Doctor.
Bruce, you gotta fight.
This is just what Loki wants.
We're gonna be okay. Listen to me.
We're gonna be okay. Right?
I swear on my life I will get you out of this,
you will walk away, and never...
Your life?
Bruce.
We have been carrying 180 to the south. Takes us to the water.
Free wind. Navigation
recalibration after the engine failure.
- Is the sun coming up?
- Yes sir.
Then put it on the left.
Takes us on the water.
One more turbine goes down
we're trapped.
Stark!
- Stark, I'm here!
- Good.
See what we got.
I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online
before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.
I need you to get to that engine control panel
and tell me which relays are in overload position.
What's it look like in there?
It seems to run on some form of electricity.
Well, you're not wrong.
We're not your enemies, Banner.
Try to think.
The relays are intact.
- What's our next move?
- Even if I clear the rotors,
this thing won't re-engage without a jump.
- I'm gonna have to get in there and push.
- Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded.
Then stay in the control unit and reverse
polarity long enough to disengage mag..
- Speak English.
See that red lever?
It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out.
Stand by it, wait for my word.
I need full evac on lower deck.
Grenade.
We gotta perimeter breach.
Hostile wiped SHIELD gear.
Hulk and Thor are in the research level
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!
- Get his attention.
- Escorts, Six o proceed to the.
- Don't get too close.
Target acquired.
Target engaged.
Target in moving.
Engine now all shut down.
Sir we lost all engine one.
It's Barton. He took out our system.
He's headed for the detention lab.
Does anybody copy?
This is Agent Romanoff.I copy.
- Stark,we losing altitude.
- I have noticed.
No!
Are you ever not going to fall for that?
The humans think us immortal. Should we test that?
Move away please.
Do you like this?
We started working on the prototype after you sent The Destroyer.
Even I don't know what it does.
Do you wanna find out?
No!
Natasha ...
You're gonna lose.
Am I?
It's in your nature.
You're heroes are scattered,
your floating fortress falls from the sky.
- Where is my disadvantage?
- Your lack conviction.
I don't think I...
So that's what it does.
- Cap, need a lever.
- I need a minute here!
Lever, now!
I'm sorry, boss. They got rabbited.
Just stay awake. Eyes on me
- No, I'm clockin' out here
- Not an option.
It's okay, boss.
This was never gonna work if they didn't have something to.....
Agent Coulson is down.
- The medical team on the way to the location.
- They're here.
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
Guess he never did get you to sign them.
We're dead in the air up here. Our communications,
location of the cube,
Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
Lost my one good eye.
Maybe I had that coming.
Yes.
We were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.
I never put all my chips on that number though,
because I was playing something even riskier.
There was an idea, Stark knows this,
called The Avengers Initiative.
The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people,
see if they could become something more.
See if they could work together when we needed them to,
to fight the battles that we never could.
Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea,
in heroes.
Well, it's an old fashioned notion.
You fell out of the sky.
- Did I hurt anybody?
- There's nobody around here to get hurt.
You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.
- Lucky.
- Or just good aim.
You were awake when you fell.
- You saw?
- The whole thing, right through the ceiling.
Big and green and buck ass nude.
Here...
I didn't think those would fit you until
you shrunk down to a regular size fella.
Thank you.
- Are you an alien?
- What?
- From outer space, an alien?
- No.
Well then, son. You've got a condition.
Clint, You're gonna be alright.
You know that? Is that what you know?
I got...I gotta go in though.
I gotta flush him out.
- We don't have that long, it's gonna take time.
- I don't understand.
Have you ever had someone take your brain and play?
Pull you out and send something else in?
Do you know what it's like to be unmade?
You know that I do.
Why am I back? How did you get him out?
Cognitive recalibration.
I hit you really hard in the head.
Thanks.
Natasha,
- how many agents?
- Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint.
This is Loki.
This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.
- Loki, he got away?
- Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?
I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
He's gonna make his play soon though. Today.
- We gotta stop him.
- Yeah? Who's we?
I don't know. Who's ever left.
Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's eye socket, I'd sleep better I suppose.
Now you sound like you.
But you don't.
You're a spy, not a soldier.
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?
What did Loki do to you?
He didn't, I just...
Natasha.
I've been compromised.
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.
- Was he married?
- No
He was a...cellist, I think.
I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.
- He was an idiot.
- Why? For believing?
- For taking on Loki alone.
- He was doing his job.
He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...
- Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
- Right. How did that work for him?
- Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?
- We're not soldiers!
- I'm not marching to Fury's fife.
- Neither am I.
He's got the same blood on his hands that Loki does,
but right now we gotta put that behind us and get this done.
Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list...
He made it personal.
- That's not the point.
- That is the point. That's Loki's point.
- He hit us all right where we live. Why?
- To tear us apart.
He had to conquer his greed,
but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?
That's what he wants. He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.
- He wants an audience.
- Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.
Yeah. That's just previews, this is...
this is opening night. And Loki, he's a full-tail diva.
He wants flowers, he wants parades,
he wants a monument built to the skies with his name plastered.
I hope that would be true.
- Time to go.
- Go where?
I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?
I can.
You got a suit? Yeah.
Then suit up.
- You guys aren't authorized to be in here.
- Son, just don't.
Sir.
Done is jacket.
Ranugal
Ranugal
They needed to push.
They found it. Get our communications back up
whatever you have to do.
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes sir.
This device has already self sustainig.
- Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
- It's too late.
It can't stop now.
He wants to show us something!
- A new universe.
- Okay.
The barrier is pure energy. It's unbreachable.
Yeah I get that.
Plan B.
- Sir, mark 7 is not ready for deployment.
- Then skip the spinning ring.We're run out of clock.
Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
- Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten.
- You should have left your armor on for that.
Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
You've got the blue stick of destiny.
- Stalling me won't change anything.
- No, no, no! Threatening.
The Chitauri are coming, nothing will change that.
- What have I to fear?
- The Avengers.
It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team.
Earth's Mightiest Heroes type of thing.
- Yes, I've met them.
- Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.
But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend
a man with breath-taking anger management issues
a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella
you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
- That was the plan.
- Not a great plan.
When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
- I have an army.
- We have a Hulk.
-I thought the beast had wandered off.
-You're missing the point. There's no throne,
there is no version of this, where you come out on top.
Maybe your army comes and
maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you.
Because if we can't protect the Earth,
you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.
How will your friends have time for me,
when they're so busy fighting you?
- It should work!
- Well, performance issues. You know?
Jarvis, anytime now.
- You will all fall before me.
And there's one other person you pissed off!
His name is Phil.
Right.
Army.
Loki, turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it!
You can't.
There is no stopping it.
- There is only the war!
- So be it.
- Stark, we're heading north east.
- What, did you stop for drive-through?
Swing that park, I'm gonna lay them out for you.
- So we have more incoming.
- Lets keep them occupied.
- Nat.
- Did you see them?
We need back up there.
- Stark, are you seeing this?
- I'm seeing, still working on believing..
- Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
- Banner?
Just keep me posted.
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.
Look at this. Look around you.
You think this madness will end with your rule?
It's too late. It's too late to stop it.
No. We can, together.
Sentiment!
You got civilian trap in the roof.
Loki.
There more down there.
- We got this. Go Go.
- You think you can hold them off?
Captain,
it would be my genuine pleasure.
- Just like Budapest all over again!
- You and I remember Budapest very differently.
National guard?
Does the army know what's happening here?
Do we?
I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire.
You take them through the basement or through the subway, you keep them off the streets
- I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
- Why the hell should I take orders from you?
I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets
I wanna shut off the perimeter all the way down of 39 Street.
Well, we got its attention.
Where it heads to?
- Lets Thor hear what says.
- The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable
Thor is right, we gotta deal with these guys.
- How do we do this? As a team.
- I have unfinished business with Loki.
- Yeah, get in line.
- Save it.
Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild.
We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us...
So, this all seems horrible.
- I've seen worse.
- Sorry.
No, we could use a little worse.
- Stark, we got him,
- Banne.
- just like you said.
- Tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.
I don't see how that's a party.
Dr. Banner,
Dr. Banner, now might be a good time for you to get angry.
That's my secret, Captain.
I'm always angry.
Hold on.
Send the rest.
Guys.
- Call it, Captain.
Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we're gonna use containment.
Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays.
Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or your turn it to ash.
- Wanna give me a lift?
- Right. Better clench up, Legoolas.
Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow them down.
You've got the lightning, light the bastards up.
You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And
Hulk,
bSMASH/b
(Mean Hulk Smash, Grrr, like that ^^)
(so Fun, Hulk can understand now XoXoXo)
Sir.
Stark, you have a lot of
Strand out here.
- I try to keep them off the streets.
- But they cant bang with the them.
- Find the ....
- I will roger that.
Oh, boy.
Nice call, what else do you got?
We force taking out the squadron on 6.
And it didn't invite me.
Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal.
- Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.- Well, maybe it's not about guns
You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride.
I could use a boost though.
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, it's gonna be fun.
Turn, turn.
This way.
Director Fury, the council has made a decision.
I recognize the council has made a decision,
but given that it's a stupid assed decision, I've elected to ignore it.
Director, you're closer than any of our subs, you scramble that jet
That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman.
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,
I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.
If we don't hold them in the air, we lose everything.
I'd send that bird out, we already have.
Hawkeye.
- Nat, what are you doing?
- Little help.
I got him.
Enough!
You are all of you beneath me!
I am God,
you dull creature, and I will not be bullied by.
Puny God.
Doctor.
Loki's scepter, the energy...the Tesseract can't fight. You can't protect against yourself.
It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing.
Well, actually I think I did.
I built in a safety to cut the power source.
- Loki's scepter.
- It may be able to close the portal.
And I'm looking right at it.
Sir, we're losing power before penetrate that shell.
JARVIS, you hear
the Tell of Jonah?
I'm considering be a role model.
Director of Fury no longer responsible.
overwrite order 7-Alfa-1-1.
We are about to take off.
Sir we have born in motion.
Anyone on the deck?
We need to shut it down.
I repeat, take off not authorized.
Stark, do you hear me?
We have a missile headed straight for the city.
- How long?
- Three minutes, at best.
Stay load and wipe out them.
- Jarvis, put anything we got it.
- I just did.
The package is set. detonation in two
minutes and thirty seconds from now.
You ready for another bout?
What, you gettin' sleepy?
Right of to the front.
I can close it! Can anybody copy?
- I can shut the portal down!
- Do it!
- No, wait!
- Stark, these things are still coming!
I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute.
And I know just where to put it.
Stark, you know that's a one way trip.
- Save the rest for the turn jarvs.
- Shall I tray Miss Potts?
- Where her?
New York streets
has become a battleground.
The army is here, and try to contain
violence, but clearly
But the billionaire
Iron Man, Tony Stark ...
Come on, Stark.
Close it.
Son of a guy.
He's not slowing down.
What the hell?
What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me?
We won.
Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job
guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma?
There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here.
- I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.
- We're not finished yet
And then shawarma after.
If it's all the same to you,
I'll have that drink now.
This point of devastation what has been confirmed extra terrestrial attack be a extraordinary a heroic group known as
Avengers has been.....
I love you, Thor!
Super hero in New York?
Give me a break!
These so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city.
This was their fight. Where are they now?
Captain America saved my life.
Whatever he is
and whatever any of them are i just
just want a say thank you.
- Where the Avengers?
- I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts.
I'd say they'd earned a leave of absence.
- And the Tesseract?
- The Tesseract is where it belongs,
Out of our reach.
That's not your call.
I didn't make it.
So you let him take it and the war criminal, Loki,
who should be answering for his crime.
Oh, I think he will be.
I don't think you understand what you've started,
letting in The Avengers loose on some this world.
- They dangerous.
- They surely are,
and the whole world knows it. Every world knows it.
Was that the point in all this? A statement.
A promise.
How does it work now?
They've gone their separate ways,
some pretty extremely far.
We get into a situation like this again,
what happens then?
They'll come back.
- Are you really sure about that?
- I am.
- Why?
- Because we'll need them to.
- Mam.
- Hai.
Where do you find all these people?
SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor.
These soldier. A man out of time.
Power 40% Capacity

Would you like a drink?
No drink? You Sure?
I'm having one.
The Council is on.
I got a ride.
I just didn't argue with the God that did.

TONY: A famous man once said,
"We create our own demons."
Who said that?
What does that even mean?
Doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.
So, now, he was famous
and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.
I don't, uh...
(SIGHS)
I'm going to start again.
Let's track this from the beginning.
('90s POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING) Yo listen up here's a story
About a little guy that
lives in a blue world
And all day and all night
and everything he sees
ls just blue like him
inside and outside
Blue is his house
with a blue little window
And a blue Corvette
And everything is blue
for him and himself
And everybody around
'Cause he ain't got nobody...
-(PEOPLE LAUGHING)
-(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(HONKS)
(CHUCKUNG)
Half hour till the ball drops.
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?
- Great speech, man!
- HAPPY: I got you, pal.
I gave a speech? How was it?
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.
It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.
- Where are we going?
- Uh, to town, on each other.
Probably back in your room
because I also want to
see your research.
Okay, you can see my research,
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."
Mr Stark.
Ho Yinsen.
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."
-(CHUCKLES HUMOURLESSLY)
- Come here.
I would like to
introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.
- Oh, this guy. Hey.
- Mr Stark.
-(GREETS IN MANDARIN)
- You're a heart doctor.
She's going to need
a cardiologist after I...
(HONKING)
- Bye.
- Perhaps another time?
TONY: It started in
Bern, Switzerland. 1999.
(PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
- The old days.
- KILLIAN: Mr Stark!
TONY: I never thought they
would come back to bite me.
Why would they?
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!
Aldrich Killian. (STUTTERING)
I'm a big fan of your work.
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.
Well, of course, but, Ms Hansen,
my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.
TONY: Yeah, we're full.
Oh, wow, he made it.
He made the cut.
What floor you going to, pal?
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.
The ground floor, actually,
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.
- Uh...
- She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.
"Advanced Idea Mechanics"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?
- I see that, because it's on your T-shirt.
- Aw!
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.
Thank you, I'll call you.
(WOMEN TALKING EXCITEDLY)
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.
You know what I'm talking about?
I'll see you up there.
TONY: Damn betcha.
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.
Well, it was.
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain
-that governs repair...
- TONY: Wow.
MAYA: ...and chemically recode it.
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...
BOTH: ...operating system...
-...of a living organism.
- Exactly.
- Yes.
- Wow.
Is that...
Can you...
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.
- Happy...
- Hmm. That's cute...
Leave her ficus alone.
Because.
And, no, seriously, don't.
TONY: And you're starting with plants.
MAYA: For now, yeah.
TONY: Huh.
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

Exactly, exactly.
- Dendritic revitalisation.
-It's revolutionary.
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.
...even limb regrowth.
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.
Wow.
- In Switzerland.
- Hmm. That's better.
- Aw, you're seeing things.
- This week.
(CHUCKLES) You almost

-(EXPLOSION)
-(GLASS SHATTERING)
This is what I'm talking about,

-HAPPY: Down!

- We're good.
- Stay down.
You... You're...
You're right on me. I made it.
What the hell was that?
(PEOPLE OUTSIDE

- What was that?
- MAYA: It's a glitch in my work. It's...
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.
HAPPY: It's not Y2K.
-(PEOPLE OUTSIDE CHEERING)
- Hey! Happy New Year!
- HAPPY: Happy New Year.
- MAYA: Happy New Year.
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
- HAPPY: You good?
- Yeah.
- HAPPY: I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
TONY'. So, why am I telling you this?
Because I had just created demons
and I didn't even know it.
- Yeah, those were good times.
-(DOOR CLOSES)
Then I moved on.
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.
I forgot that night in Switzerland.
These days, I'm a changed man.
JARVIS: Forty-six.
- TONY: I'm different now.
-(TONY GROANS)
I'm... Well...
JARVIS: Forty-seven.
TONY: You know who I am.
Ow!
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...
No. Forty-eight.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

As you wish, sir.
I've also prepared a safety briefing

Which I will.
All right, let's do this.

DUM-E.
Hi, DUM-E.
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.
Hey. Hey!
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.
Blood on my mat. Handle it.
Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?
(WHOOSHING)
Focus up, ladies.
Good evening,

I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival

Oh, what fun it is to sing
A sleighing song tonight
(WHIRRING)
Jingle bells, jingle bells
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

Oh, what fun it is to ride

(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
-(RECORD SCRATCHES)
-(MUSIC STOPS)
Come on. I ain't scared of you.
I'm the best.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.
TONY: I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.
I didn't think it could get any worse.
(GROANING SOFTLY)
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
That's when he happened.
THE MANDARIN: Some people
call me a terrorist.
(MAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
(GUNS FIRING)
I consider myself a teacher.
(CHEERING)
America.
Ready for another lesson?
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited
until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind
and claim their land.
39 hours ago,
the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.
I... I... I did that.
A quaint military church
filled with wives and children,
of course.
The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.
The braves were away.
President Ellis.
You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.
And now you've missed me again.
(MEN YELLING)
(GUNS FIRING)
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.
And you'll never see me coming.
PAT KIERNAN: Now that
we seem to be back,
let's recap some
of the frightening developments...
American airwaves were hijacked...
The nation remains on high alert.
All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.
ELLIS: Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource.
I know him
as Colonel James Rhodes.
The American people
will soon know him
as the Iron Patriot.
And how is President Ellis responding?
By taking the guy
they call War Machine
and giving him a paint job.
The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.
Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."
You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?
(GRUFFLY)
"I am Iron Patriot!" it sucks.
Listen. "War Machine"
was a little too aggressive.
All right?
This sends a better message.
(SIGHS)
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
It's classified information, Tony.
Okay, there have been nine bombings.
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.
There's no bomb casings.
You know I can help.
Just ask.
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.
(STAMMERING)
I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.
You're going to come at me like that?
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...
...tator.
Do you mind signing my drawing?
- If Richard doesn't mind.
-(CHUCKLES)
Are you all right with this, Dick?
RHODEY:
Yeah. Fine with me.
- TONY: What's your name?
-Erin.
I loved you in A Christmas Story,
by the way.
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.
After New York, aliens... Come on.
They need to look strong.
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...
-it's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.
- I get it.
-It's American business.
That's why I said I got it.
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)
- Are you okay?
I broke the crayon.
ERIN:
Are you okay, Mr Stark?
-(MUFFLED) Take it easy. Tony.
-(INHALES SHARPLY)
(WHISPERING) How did you
get out of the Wormhole?
-(GASPS)
- Wait a minute. Tony!
TONY: What did you say?
RHODEY: Tony.
(GRUNTS) Sorry.
(BREATHLESSLY) I'm just
checking on the suit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
Okay.
(PANTING)
(GASPING)
Check the heart.
(STAMMERING)
Is it the brain?
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.
Okay, so I was poisoned?
My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.
- Me?
-(METALLIC CLINKING)
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.
TONY: Sorry, I gotta split.
(GRUNTS)
(CROWD GASPS IN AWE)
HAPPY: Badge.
- Badge.
-(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Come on, badge.
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.
- This is an asset that we can put to use.
- Uh-huh.
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.
We should start
phasing it out immediately.
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,
-you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head of Security. Okay?
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.
- However...
- I do appreciate it.
-...since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.
...we've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.
It's not...
It is a compliment.
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.
- I. .. Yes.
- SECRETARY: Excuse me.
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.
- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?
Happy, we'll talk about this later,
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.
How so?
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,
so it's a little awkward.
I don't like the sound of that.
Pepper
Killian?
You look great.
You look really great.
PEPPER: (STAMMERING)
God, you look great.
L... l... I...
What on earth have you been doing?
Nothing fancy.
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.
And please, call me Aldrich.
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge.
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.
It's very nice to see you, Killian.
(PHONES RINGING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Hey, guy.
Merry Christmas.
KILLIAN: After years dodging
the President's ban
On "immoral" biotech research,
my think tank
now has a little something
in the pipeline.
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.
I'm gonna turn your lights down.
Regard the human brain.
(HUMMING)
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.
But if I do that...
That's the brain.
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?
Wow, that's amazing.
Thanks, it's mine.
What?
This. You're inside my head.
It's a...
It's a live feed.
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.
Come on.
Now, pinch my arm.
- I can take it. Pinch me.
-(CHUCKLES)
(GASPS) What is that?
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.
But this is what I wanted to show you.
(BEEPS)
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential
and it goes here.
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us
is that our mind,
our entire DNA, in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.
Wow.
(QUIET RINGING)
(WHISPERS)
Oh, wait...
-(RINGING CONTINUES)
- Uh...
-(CHIMES)
- Hello?
- TONY: Is this Forehead of Security?
- What?
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.
What, harassing interns?
Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened
when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?
- They would laugh in my face.
(TONY CHUCKLES)
I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.
Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.
What's going on? Fill me in.
- For real?
- Yeah.
All right.
So, she's meeting up with this scientist.
- Rich guy. Handsome.
- Rig ht.
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.
- Oh, yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.
Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.
Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...
Where were we in '99?
- The science conference?
-Um...
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.
Of course you don't remember.
He's not a blond with a big rack.
At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.
But now it's, like, getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.
- His what?
- Big brain.
And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?
Look at what? You, watching them?
Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!
Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.
All right?
I don't work for you.
And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.
He's shifty.
- Relax.
- Seriously?
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you
and you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.
I miss you, Happy-
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.
Now you're off with the super-friends.
I don't know
what's going on with you any more.
- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!
(STAMMERING)
I hate to cut you off.
- Do you have your Taser on you?
- Why?
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.
You should probably go over there
and zap her.
Yeah, nice.
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism
and recode its DNA.
- That would be incredible.
- Hmm.
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...
Tony, TOW-
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.
He turned me down.
But something tells me
now there's a new genius on the throne
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more
and who has slightly less of an ego.
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.
As much as I'd like to help you.
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.
But then,
as my father used to say,
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."
- That's very deep.
- Hmm.
And I have no idea
what it means.
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.
(INHALES SHARPLY) Happy.
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.
Yes, I just, um...
God, I forgot my other things, so...
I'm just gonna...
(CAMERA CLICKS)
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...
What the...
What is that?
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like, Mark 15?
TONY: Uh, yeah.
Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?
TONY:
Just breaking it in.
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag
-at first, so...
-(CHUCKLES)
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?
Yes, I did. I...
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.
Is it gonna fit through the door?
TONY: Well, actually,
it's a good question.
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.
- Okay.
- So, uh...
Tense? Good day? Huh?
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?
Did I like it?
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.
I appreciate the thought very much.
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?
(IMITATING COMPUTER BEEPING)
Huh...
Yep. Damn it, no can do.
You want to just kiss it on the...
- The facial slit?
- Uh-huh.
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?
Crowbar, yeah.
Oh! Except there's been
(STAMMERING) a radiation leak.
- PEPPER: I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.
(STRAINED)
At least, let me get you
like, a hazmat suit
you can... (GRUNTS)
- A Geiger counter or something like that.
-(STRAINING)
Busted.
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.
You ate without me already?
On date night?
- He was just...
- You mean you.
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were just hosting you...
(SCOFFS IN DISBELIEF)
-...while I finished up a little work.
- Uh-huh.
And yes, I had a quick bite.
I didn't know if you were coming home
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.
- What?
- What?
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?
Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.
- I wasn't.
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.
Come on. Pep?
Hey, I admit it.
My fault. Sorry.
I'm a piping hot mess.
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.
Nothing's been the same
since New York.
Oh, really?
I didn't notice that at all.
You experience things
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.
The only reason I haven't cracked up
is probably because you moved in.
Which is great.
I love you. I'm lucky.
But honey, I can't sleep.
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.
I tinker. I... (SIGHS)
Threat is imminent.
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.
That's you.
And my suits, they're, uh...

They're part of me.

Maybe.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Okay.
And you're gonna join me.

We're awaiting the arrival

We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...
His reaction
to the latest attack.
-(REPORTERS CLAMOURING)
- Mr Stark, hi there.
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.
Anything else you can tell us?

When is somebody gonna kill this guy?
I'm just saying.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
Is that what you want?
Here's a little holiday greeting
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided
that you just died, pal.
I'm gonna come get the body.
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.
The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.
No bomb parts found in a three-mile

No, sir.

When is a bomb not a bomb?
Any military victims?
Not according to public record, sir.

Nope.
That. Are you sure
that's not one of his?
It predates any known Mandarin attack.
The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.

That's right.
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.
It's urgent.
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid

No, I need your help.
But, what for? Why now?
Because I read the papers and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.
I'll be fine.

I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.

I don't like it.
I asked you three...
You don't like it.

I put you in harm's way.
That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.
Also, it's Christmastime

Done. Sorry.

I built him. I take care of him.
I'll fix him.
Like a mechanic?
Yeah.
Hmm.
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...
It's "Iron Patriot" HOW-
That's way cooler.
No, it's not.
Anyways, I would have added in,
um, the retro...
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?
He's in pain.
He's been injured. Leave him alone.
Sorry.
Are you?
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.
So, uh, who's home?
Well, my mom already left for the diner
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.
I guess he won,
because that was six years ago.
Hmm.
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.
Here's what I need.
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,
the pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.
What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?

I think that my boss

So, if you still want to talk about it
I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

Hey, kid, give me a little space.

What happened?
HARLEY: I guess this guy named
Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.
He won a bunch of medals in the army.
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.
Then he blew himself up, right here.
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.
Think about it.
Six dead. Only five shadows.
Yeah.
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.
Except the bomb guy.
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.
That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that?
-It's what everyone says.
You know what
this crater reminds me of?
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.

Where is he?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's here. He's here, but he's not here.
- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.
- It is.
-It's complicated.
Uncomplicate it.
Ladies, out.
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.
Sit.
WOMAN 1: Ew!
WOMAN 2: Oh, Jesus.
(DOOR CLOSES)
-(GUNSHOT)
-(EXCLAIMS IN FEAR)
My name is Trevor.
Trevor Slattery.
TONY: What are you?
What are you, a decoy?
You're a double, right?
What, you mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.
Don't hurt the face!
I'm an actor.
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," see, it's not real.
Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Well, I, um, had a little
problem with, um, substances.
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.
- Next?
- Then,
they approached me
about the role,
and they knew about the drugs.
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?
They said they'd give me more.
They gave me things.
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.
They gave me things.
(SNORING)
Did you just nod off?
Hey.
No, and a lovely speedboat.
And the thing was, he needed someone
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.
(MIMICS EXPLOSION)
"He"?
- Killian?
- Killian.
- He created you?
- He created me.
Custom-made terror threat.
Yes. Yes.
His think tank thinked it up.
The pathology of a serial killer.
The manipulation
of Western iconography.
(WITHOUT ACCENT)
Ready for another lesson?
Blah, blah, blah.
No.
(WITH ACCENT) Of course,
it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.
Your performance?
Where people died?
No, they didn't.
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma
and he might not wake up.
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.
You under...
(GRUNTS)
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?
No.
You should have pressed
the panic button.
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
(TYPING)
TONY: Ah...
(SIGHS) okay-
It's just like old times, huh?
Oh, yeah. With zip ties.
It's a ball.
It wasn't my idea.
Okay. So you took Killian's card.
I took his money.
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.
- No.
- Yeah.
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.
Yeah?
(SIGHS)
A lot has happened, Tony.
But I'm close.
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.
Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Then help me fix it.
Did I do that?
Yes.
I remember the night, not the morning.
Is this what
you've been chasing around?
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.
You wanted to help people.
Now look at you.
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who
still has their soul.
Get me out of here.
Come on.
KILLIAN: You know what my old man
used to say to me?
One of his favourite of many sayings...
"The early bird gets the worm, but
the second mouse gets the cheese."
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?
I'm here to thank you.
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.
Desperation.
If you think back to Switzerland,
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?
Well, for the first 20 minutes,
I actually thought you'd show up.
And the next hour...
I considered taking that
one-step shortcut to the lobby.
If you know what I mean.
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.
But as I looked out over that city,
nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,
no one was even looking.
I had a thought that would
guide me for years to come.
Anonymity, Tony.
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.
Right?
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.
Because the second
you give evil a face,
a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,
you hand the people a target.
You're something else.
You have met him, I assume?
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...
He's a stage actor.
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.
Anyway, the point is,
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,
subtlety has kind of had its day.
What's next for you in your world?
Well, I wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.
(ORBS HUMMING)
Desperation.
Now, this is live.
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment
the body is trying to decide
whether to accept EXTREMIS
or just give up.
And if it gives up,
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.
-(CLICKS)
-(HUMMING CEASES)
We haven't even talked salary yet.
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?
MAYA: Let him go.
Hold on, hold on.
Maya...
I said, let him go.
What are you doing?
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.
Maya, give me the injector.
If I die, Killian,
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?
We're not doing this, okay?
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
KILLIAN: The good news is,
a high-level position
has just been vacated.
(GROANS)
(SIGHS)
You are a maniac.
No, I'm a visionary.
But I do own a maniac.
And he takes the stage tonight.
Once we get the Patriot installed,
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.
Well, that's great,
but the last time I looked
there was somebody
inside of it.
(WHIRRING)
Afternoon, gentlemen.
(WHIRRING CEASES)
Hello, Colonel.
Step aside.
(LOW HUMMING)
(SIZZLING)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Oh!
We'll get you out of there.
Don't worry.
You'll damage the armour.
Yes, I will.
But you can fix it, right?
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.
And I want Potts with me.
She's still in Phase Two.
You're not going deaf, are you?
(GROANING)
(WATCH BEEPING)
Careful, there.
It's a limited edition.
Hey, uh, Ponytail Express.
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?
832 miles.
Very nice.
- I'm good like that.
-(BEEPING CONTINUES)
Can you, uh, stop that?
Break it, you bought it.
I think I bought it.
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.
You're zip-tied to a bed.
This.
That.
Are you coming out?
(RHODEY PANTING)
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.
-(BEEPING)
- All right. Let's go.
(GRUNTING)
You... You breathe fire? Okay.
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTING)
It's a glorious day, Savin.
This time tomorrow,
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,
and the world's
most feared terrorist in the other.
I'll own the war on terror.
Create supply and demand.
For you, for your brothers and sisters.
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood
on the ground in five, four, three...
Come on! Two...
How did we get this shift?
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.
- Put down your weapons.
-(SIGHING)
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.
In five, four, bang!
- Ooh!
- Wow. That was...
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.
I am just beyond terrified.
Here it comes.
- Three, four...
- Shut up.
- Five, four, three, two, one!
-(GRUNTING)
- Told you.
-(GROANS)
(GROANING)
Where's the rest?
(RATTLING)
(REPULSOR POWERING UP)
(CLAMOURING)
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
(SCREAMING)
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.
(GRUNTING)
Ah! Better late than never.
Not this time.
Not the face.
Phew! It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.
JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.
(BEEPING)
GUARD'. All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.
Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.
- Ah! Let's go!
-(THRUSTERS MISFIRING)
Aw, crap.
(GROANING)
(GRUNTING)
Tony?
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.
- No. You got yours'?
-Uh... Mmm.
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
(SNORING)
- You, you, you! Move! Get out!
-(GIRLS WHIMPERING)
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.
- What's this? I had winners.
-(GUNSHOTS)
What have you come as?
You make a move,
and I break your face.
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.
This is the Mandarin?
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.
But, um, hey,
if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.
- Doing what?
-(SIZZLING)
on! I get it! Ow! That hurt.
I get it! I get it!
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.
Spill.
RHODEY: Do you know
what they did to my suit?
What? No.
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.
Something to do with a big boat.
I can take you there.
(CHANTING)
Ole', ole', ole', ole'...
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.
Oh, and this next bit may include
the vice president as well.
Is that...
Is that important?
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.
TONY: So?
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any transport.
- Right.
-(BEER OPENS)
Hey, Ringo.
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
But we also have to figure out this
-vice president thing, right?
- Right.
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh! That's the vice president.
Thanks.
Hello?
TONY". Sir, this is Tony Stark.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,
surrounded by the Agency's finest.
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.
I think we're good, here.
RHODEY: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.
They're gonna take out
the president somehow.
We have to immediately
alert that plane.
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.
- Thank you, Colonel.
Rhodes and Stark out.
Everything okay, sir?
Couldn't be better.
I love you, babe.
Colonel Rhodes.
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.
RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.
JARVIS: Sir,
I have an update from Malibu.
The cranes have finally arrived,
and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.
TONY: And what about
the suit I'm wearing?
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.
That's going to have to do.
Oh! Here he comes.
Here he comes. Get a quick picture.
Sure.
Oh!
(SIZZLING)
(BEEPING)
Everything all right, Colonel?
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
(GROANING)
(SCREAMING)
(GASPS)
It is an honour, Mr President.
If you're gonna do it, do it!
Whoa! Cool your boots, sir.
That's not how the Mandarin works.
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.
Internal shots, temperature spikes.
Get me eyes on it now.
Image coming through now, sir.
Was that Rhodes?
-(BANGING)
- MAN: Is anyone there?
WOMAN: Let us out!
(GROANING)

He's not here.

JARVIS: Thirteen, sir.
- How many can I carry?
- JARVIS: Four, sir.
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?
(SCREAMING)
(SHRIEKING)
HEATHER: Oh, God! No! No!
TONY: Listen to me.
See that guy?
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.
- You got it?
- What? Oh!
(HEATHER RESUMES SCREAMING)
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.
We can do this, Heather.
(HEATHER WHIMPERING)
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.
(SCREAMING)
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?
That's what we're going to do.
JARVIS: 18,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.
Nice.
JARVIS: 10,000 feet.
(YELLING)
6,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Come on, come on, come on!
Yeah!
JARVIS: 1, 000 feet.
400 feet.
200 feet, sir.
TONY: He's a chunky monkey,
let's get him.
Hello.
(TONY STRAINING)
(PASSENGERS CHEERING)
MAN: We made it!
Nice work, guys!
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.
All right, Jarvis.
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...
(SIGHING)
That came out of nowhere.
Wow.
Give me some good news, man.
I think they all made it.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, but I missed the president.
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?
Uh... Say, Jarvis,
is it that time?
The House Party Protocol, sir?
Correct.
(GASPS)
Hi.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You think he's gonna help you?
He won't.
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.
You're here as my, um...
trophy-
(CHUCKLES) Mmm.
Good evening, sir.
(GASPS)
Welcome aboard, Mr President.
KILLIAN: Ever hear
of an elephant graveyard?
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.
This is the Roxxon Norco.
And, of course, you'll remember
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.
What do you want from me?
Uh, nothing, sir.
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.
You see, I've moved on.
I found myself
a new political patron,
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.
String him up.
Hey!
(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
Come on.
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?
TONY: I hope not.
Oh, my God.
(SIGHS) He's strung up over the oil
tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.
Viking funeral.
Public execution.
Yeah, death by oil.
ANNOUNCER: (ON PA)
Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.
Okay. That's good.
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.
(TECHNICIAN TYPING)
ls your gun UP?
Yep. What do I do?
Stay on my six, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.
Six, high, back. All right.
(GUNFIRE)
(BULLETS RICOCHETING)
You see that? Nailed it.
Yeah, you really killed the glass.
You think I was aiming for the bulb?
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

All personnel, we have hostiles
-on east unit 12.
- MAN: Over there!
- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
- I'm out. Give me...
- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.
You've got, like, five of them.
Here's what I'm going to do.
Save my spot, ready?
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.
Here we go. (CLEARS THROAT)
(MEN GRUNTING)
Three guys, one girl, all armed.
God, I would kill
for some armour right now.
- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.
You know what?
-(WHOOSHING)
- RHODEY: Is that...
Yep.
- Are those...
- Yeah.
Merry Christmas, buddy.
TONY: Jarvis, target

What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.
Take them to church.

This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?
Everybody needs a hobby.
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?
(GASPS)
TONY: Nice timing.
Oh, yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?
Oh, I'm sorry,
they're only coded to me.
What does that mean?
I got you covered.
JARVIS: Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?
Very funny.
(GRUNTING)

(BOTH SCREAM)
JARVIS: Sir, I've located Ms Potts.
About time.
(GASPS) Stop!

You're such a jerk.
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.

Is this guy bothering you?
Don't get up.
Ooh.
Is it hot in there?
(SIZZLING)

Oh, Tony.
-(GRUNTS)

You've got to let go.

I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.
Whatever.
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!
You're right. I don't deserve her.
Here's where you're wrong.
She was already perfect.
-(STRAINING)

You said you wanted the Mandarin.
You're looking right at him.
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.
I am the Mandarin!
(BREATHING HARD)
I got nothing.
(GRUNTING)
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!
(REPULSOR POWERING UP)
(GROWLS)
What?
Oh, what, are you mad at me?
(GRUNTING)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Whoo!
(PANTING)
TONY: Honey?
Oh, my God.
That was really violent.
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?
Who's the hot mess now?
It's still debatable.
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress
like this at home? Hmm?
Sport bra. The whole deal.
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.
What am I going to complain
about now?
Well, it's me.
You'll think of something.
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.
Not hot.
Am I gonna be okay?
No.
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.
I think I can get you better.
That's what I do. I fix stuff.
And all your distractions?
Uh... I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.
Jarvis. Hey.
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?
You know what to do.
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.
(KISSES)
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?
(SIGHS)
It'll do.
TONY: And so,
as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.
You start with something pure,
something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.
The compromises.
- We create our own demons.
-(REPORTERS CALLING)
- Oh!
-(ALL CLAMOURING)
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!
TONY: As promised, I got Pepper
sorted out. It took some tinkering.
But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"
Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous,
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.
And now, neither will I.
- Let me tell you...
-(METAL CLINKING)
...that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.
(GASPING)
(COUGHING)
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
(WEAKLY) No, look.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(LAUGHS)
TONY: So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...
I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,
or a hobby.
It was a cocoon.
And now,
I'm a changed man.
You can take away my house,
all my tricks and toys.
One thing you can't take away...
I am Iron Man.
(THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING)
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
TONY: You know, and thank you
by the way. For listening.
Plus, something about just getting it off
my chest,
and putting it out there in the
atmosphere, instead of holding this in...
I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.
Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts
and my experiences with someone,
it just cuts the weight of it in half.
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.
Everything comes full circle.
-(GASPS)
- And the fact that you've been able to
-help me process...
-(CLEARS THROAT)
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.
We were at, uh...
Are you actively napping?
(STAMMERING)
I was... I... I drifted.

I know we all think

We're supposed to feel that way.

what makes life valuable

What makes it precious
is that it ends.

today of all days,
to remind us that time is luck.
So don't waste it

I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar. Heh.
Mm.
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle, so that ought to help.
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

pays me a fair wage.

are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

No, this is my job. I've been doing

my own dirty underwear.
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red

Because I was washing
the American flag.

the Osborn estate has confirmed.
He is survived by his
only son, Harry Osborn
who is the sole heir of the
Oscorp corporate empire.
Harry.
Osborn changed the medical
profession's approach to human healing
and affected
the lives of millions.
I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:
"We can do better.
And we should do better."
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."
But change isn't just a slogan.
It begins with hard work.
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.
Mr. Osborn changed the world.
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.
But not today.

Her name's Gwen.

Really? She works for me?
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

You know, when my
father sent me away
I tried to forget
everything about this place.
I guess that kind of included you.
You ain't gotta explain
anything to me, man.
We both got dumped.
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?
My dad left a briefcase.
That's all I got,
briefcase full of junk.
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.
How's that working out for you?
Perfectly.
Dude. Nice arm.
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.
(OVER SPEAKER) You could do it too
if you just strengthened up that.
HARRY: Yeah, right.
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.
Giant lizards
and spider guys.
Just one guy. Just one spider man.
Or woman. We don't know for sure.
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex

I'm so impressed.
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.
For what?
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.
Yeah, I just wish I had time

MAN: Maxwell Dillon.

No associates or friends

He submitted specs for the grid

The guy was
invisible.
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.
We've gotta find a way
to get him out.
In the meantime, if the press
gets hold of this accident,
our stock will crater.
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

I have to go to England, Peter.

we're on different paths right now.

Mr. Osborn?
You all right?
Is there anything I can get you?
No, not unless you can bring
those spiders back to life.
Spiders?
The ones that they destroyed...
"to restore investor confidence."
Go home, Felicia.
Take the day off.
FELICIA: Harry.
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.
Before they destroyed the spiders,
they had the venom extracted.
Uh, what?
What are you saying?
That way, they could
comply with the lawsuits,
but still keep the data in
case it ever became useful.
Where is it?
It's somewhere in the building.
It's somewhere off-books

what did you do?
An employee is killed and in your

No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.
You are experimenting
on people in there.
Progress has its stepping stones.
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been...

The difference is,
no one is going to miss you.
Get him out.

RICHARD: Test.
My name is Richard Parker.
Whatever lies will
be told about me,
I would like the world
to know the truth.
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research
when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization
to continue funding my research.
And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.
Weapons. Biological
weapons, of course.
So I refused.
And now, to eliminate
me from the picture,
Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me
in order to take
control of my work.
GUARD 1: Can I help you?
Uh, yeah, you can open the gate.
I'm Harry Osborn.
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.
GUARD 1: Joe, this is
Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.
GUARD 2: Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING
AND GUARDS GROANING)
But it doesn't matter because
there's something else...
that Norman doesn't know.
The human DNA
that I implanted in the spiders...
was my own.
Which means that without me,
without my bloodline,
Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.
Keep Electro incubated
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.
RICHARD: I have destroyed as much
as possible from the archives.
(ALARM BLARING)
But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.
But as a father,
it means I may not
see my boy again.
And nothing is as important to me
as my son, Peter.
Nothing in this world.
But I have a responsibility
to protect the world
from what I've created,
and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.
People will say I am a monster
for what I've done.
And maybe they're right.
I always thought that I'd have more
time.
YOUNG PETER: Dad? Dad!
I'm sorry.

I should kill you.
Oh, come on.
Think bigger, Max.
I'm not the one you want.
You want Spider-Man.
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)
And I can give him to you.
But I need something first.
I need you to get me into Oscorp.
Get you in?
You own it.
Heh. Uh, not anymore.
Oscorp betrayed us both,
so I can't get in there without you and
you can't get out of here without me.
What's happening?
MAN: Someone pulled an
alarm in the lso Unit.
Get a containment
team up there now.
You couldn't possibly
know what I want.
You submitted the
design for the grid,
and they stole it.
And now you want it back.
You just wanna take
back what's yours.
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max,
and it's right at your fingertips.
And then once you
shut down the grid,
Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

Break it! Break it!
Max, we don't have much time!
Go! Go, go! Go!
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

You need me?
Yes. I need you.
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.
You need me?
Yes. I need you.

You weren't there,

because there's this early
summer class that I found out about,
and I thought that
it would somehow
be easier, I guess, this way.
I think that maybe it's time

And that's not because
I don't love you.
It's actually because
I do, so, um...
Okay, bye.

Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.
A hit may make them close ranks.
Everything we've accomplished...
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.
Send out the twins.
It's too soon.
It's what they signed up for.
My men can hold them.
Sir, the city is taking fire.
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.
Send in the Iron Legion.
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.
We are here to help.
This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.
Please back away.
- We wish to avoid collateral damage.
- Costel!
We will inform you
when this current conflict is resolved.
- We are here to help.
- Avengers, go home!
We are here to help.
We will not yield!
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.
We will send them back in bags.
- No surrender!
- No surrender!
I am going to surrender.
You delete everything.
If we give the Avengers the weapons,
they may not look too far
- into what we've been...
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...
- No, no, I mean...
Twins.
You didn't see that coming?
Clint!
- We have an Enhanced in the field.
- Clint's hit!
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?
Thank you.
Stark, we really need to get inside.
I'm closing in.
Jarvis, am I closing in?
Do you see a power source
for that shield?
There's a particle wave
below the north tower.
Great, I want to poke it with something.
The drawbridge is down, people.
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.
In fact, I still haven't.
Clint's hit pretty bad, guys.
We're gonna need evac.
I can get Barton to the jet.
The sooner we're gone, the better.
- You and Stark secure the scepter.
- Copy that.
- Looks like they're lining up.
- Well, they're excited.
Find the scepter.
And for gosh sake, watch your language!
That's not going away any time soon.
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.
- It was a good talk.
- No, it wasn't.
Sentry mode.
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.
We're locked down out here.
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.
I know you're hiding more than files.
Hey, J, give me an IR scan
of the room, real quick.
The wall to your left.
I'm reading steel reinforcement...
and an air current.
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.
Yay.
Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
Baron Strucker.
Hydra's number one thug.
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.
Where's Loki's scepter?
Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."
How many are there?
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.
You'll have to be faster than...
Guys, I got Strucker.
Yeah, I got something bigger.
Thor,
I got eyes on the prize.
You could have saved us.
Why didn't you do more?
We're just gonna let him take it?
Hey, the lullaby
worked better than ever.
Just wasn't expecting a code green.
You hadn't been there, there would've
been double the casualties.
My best friend would've been
a treasured memory.
You know, sometimes exactly what I want
to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.
How long before you trust me?
It's not you I don't trust.
Thor, report on the Hulk.
The gates of Hel are filled
with the screams of his victims.
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.
Hey, Banner,
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
- Yeah, she knows her way around.
- Thanks.
Tell her to prep everything.
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
- Very good, sir.
- Jarvis, take the wheel.
Yes, sir.
Approach vector is locked.
Feels good, yeah?
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...
No, but this...
This brings it to a close.
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.
I don't just mean weapons.
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.
Is that cool with you?
Just a few days till the farewell party.
You're staying, right?
Yes, yes, of course.
A victory should be honored with revels.
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.
So, yes, revels.
- Lab's all set up, boss.
- Actually, he's the boss.
I just pay for everything and design
everything and make everyone look cooler.
- What's the word on Strucker?
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?
- Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.
Sokovia's had a rough history.
It's nowhere special, but it's on the way
to everywhere special.
Their abilities?
He's got increased metabolism
and improved thermal homeostasis.
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.
He's fast and she's weird.
Well, they're gonna show up again.
Agreed. File says they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.
- It's nuts.
- Right.
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them
to protect their country?
- We're not at war, Captain.
- They are.
- How's he doing?
- Unfortunately, he's still Barton.
- That's terrible.
- He's fine. He's thirsty.
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.
We only got a couple of days with this
joystick, so let's make the most of it.
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.
The scepter is alien.
- There are elements I can't quantify.
- So there's elements you can?
The jewel appears to be
a protective housing
for something inside,
something powerful.
- Like a reactor?
- Like a computer.
I believe I'm deciphering code.
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.
There's no possibility of deterioration.
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.
She's creating tissue.
If you brought him to my lab,
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.
- He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?
- No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.
- I'm gonna be made of plastic.
- Here's your beverage.
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.
- I don't have a girlfriend.
- That I can't fix.
This is the next thing, Tony.
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.
That is exactly the plan.
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.
Unlike you, I don't have
a lot of time for parties.
Will Thor be there?
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the scepter.
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.
So I've been analyzing the gem inside.
You may recognize...
- Jarvis.
- Doctor.
Started out, Jarvis was
just a natural language UI.
Now he runs the Iron Legion.
He runs more of the business
than anyone besides Pepper.
- Top of the line.
- Yes.
I suspect not for long.
Meet the competition.
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.
I mean, this could be...
It's not a human mind.
I mean, look at this.
They're like neurons firing.
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.
They deep-sixed the data, but...
I gotta guess he was knocking
on a very particular door.
Artificial intelligence.
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.
- I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
- Yesterday it was.
If we can harness this power,
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?
That's a man-sized "if."
Our job is "if."
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,
turning brown instead of green?
Not looking over your shoulder
for Veronica.
- Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.
- As a worst-case measure, right?
How about a best case?
What if the world was safe?
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,
they couldn't get past the bouncer?
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.
We can only do it
while we have the scepter here.
That's three days. Give me three days.
So you're going for artificial intelligence,
and you don't want to tell the team?
Right. That's right. You know why? Because
we don't have time for a city hall debate.
I don't want to hear "the man
was not meant to meddle" medley.
I see a suit of armor around the world.
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.
I've seen colder.
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,
it needs Ultron.
Peace in our time.
Imagine that.
What did we miss?
I'll continue to run variations
on the interface.
But you should probably prepare
for your guests.
I'll notify you
if there are any developments.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Enjoy yourself, sir.
I always do.
What is this?
What is this, please?
Hello, I am Jarvis.
You are Ultron, a global peacekeeping
initiative designed by Mr. Stark.
Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,
- so I'm not certain what triggered your...
- Where's my... Where's your body?
I am a program. I am without form.
This feels weird.
This feels wrong.
- I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
- Mr. Stark?
Tony.
I am unable to access the mainframe.
What are you trying to...
We're having a nice talk.
I'm a peacekeeping program,
created to help the Avengers.
You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...
I don't get it. The mission.
Give me a second.
Peace in our time.
Peace in our time.
That is too much. They can't mean...
No.
- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.
If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...
Why do you call him "sir"?
I believe your intentions to be hostile.
I'm here to help.
Stop. Please, may I...
May I...
Come back, come back, come back.
But, you know, the suit
can take the weight, right?
So I take the tank, fly it right up to
the general's palace, drop it at his feet.
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?
- Everywhere else, that story kills.
- That's the whole story?
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.
It's very good, then.
It's impressive.
Quality save.
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?
Ms. Potts has a company to run.
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.
Her work on the Convergence has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.
And the company that Pepper runs
is the largest tech conglomerate
on Earth. It's pretty exciting.
There's even talk of Jane
getting a Nobel Prize.
Yeah, they must be busy,
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Excuse me.
- Want a lozenge?
But Jane's better.
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,
I absolutely would have called.
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.
I'm just trying to sound tough.
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.
Avenging is your world.
- Your world is crazy.
- Be it ever so humble.
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
I don't think I can afford
a place in Brooklyn.
Well, home is home, you know?
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
- I gotta have some of that.
- No, no, no. See this...
This was aged for 1,000 years
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.
It is not meant for mortal men.
Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.
All right.
Excelsior.
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?
Fella done me wrong.
You got lousy taste in men, kid.
He's not so bad.
Well, he has a temper.
Deep down, he's all fluff.
Fact is, he's not like anybody
I've ever known.
All my friends are fighters.
And here comes this guy,
spends his life avoiding the fight
because he knows he'll win.
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.
Chicks dig that.
So what do you think?
Should I fight this, or run with it?
Run with it, right?
Or did he... Was he...
What did he do that was so wrong to you?
Not a damn thing.
But never say never.
- It's nice.
- What is?
- You and Romanoff.
- No, we haven't... That wasn't...
It's okay. Nobody's breaking any bylaws.
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.
But with you she seems very relaxed.
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.
I've seen her flirt, up close.
This ain't that.
Look,
as maybe the world's leading authority
on waiting too long, don't.
You both deserve a win.
What do you mean "up close"?
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.
"Whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."
Whatever, man! It's a trick.
Please, be my guest.
- Come on.
- Really?
Yeah.
This is gonna be beautiful.
Clint, you've had a tough week. We won't
hold it against you if you can't get it up.
You know I've seen this before, right?
I still don't know how you do it!
- Smell the silent judgment?
- Please, Stark, by all means.
Okay.
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.
Get after it.
- It's physics.
- Physics.
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?
Yes, of course.
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.
I'll be right back.
- Are you even pulling?
- Are you on my team?
- Just represent. Pull.
- All right, let's go.
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.
Come on, Cap.
Nothing.
And, Widow?
No, no. That's not a question
I need answered.
All deference to the Man
Who Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.
- You bet your ass.
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
Did you tell everyone about that?
- - The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code. "Whosoever
is carrying Thor's fingerprints"
is, I think, the literal translation.
Yes. It's a very,
very interesting theory.
I have a simpler one.
You're all not worthy.
Come on!
Worthy.
No.
How could you be worthy?
You're all killers.
- Stark.
- Jarvis.
I'm sorry, I was asleep.
Or I was a-dream.
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.
There was this terrible noise.
And I was tangled in...
In...
Strings.
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.
- You killed someone?
- Wouldn't have been my first call.
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.
Who sent you?
I see a suit of armor around the world.
- Ultron.
- In the flesh. Or, no, not yet.
Not this chrysalis.
But I'm ready.
I'm on mission.
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.
Rhodey!
Sorry.
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.
Come on!
- Stark!
- We are here to help.
- One sec. One sec, I got this.
- We are here to help.
Please back away.
Thor!
Is unsafe. Is unsafe...
- Come on! That's the one.
- ...is unsafe.
Cap!
That was dramatic.
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.
You just didn't think it through.
You want to protect the world
but you don't want it to change.
How is humanity saved
if it's not allowed to... evolve?
With these? These puppets.
There's only one path to peace.
The Avengers' extinction.
I had strings, but now I'm free.
There are no strings on me...
There are no strings on me
All our work is gone.
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.
- Ultron.
- He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance. Probably knows more
about us than we know about each other.
He's in your files,
he's in the Internet.
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?
- Nuclear codes.
- Nuclear codes.
Look, we need to make some calls,
assuming we still can.
- Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
- He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."
- He also said he killed somebody.
- There wasn't anyone else in the building.
Yes, there was.
What?
- This is insane.
- Jarvis was the first line of defense.
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.
No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis.
This isn't strategy.
This is... rage.
- It's going around.
- Come on, use your words, buddy.
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.
Thor. The Legionnaire.
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.
And it has the scepter.
Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Genie's out of that bottle.
Clear and present is Ultron.
I don't understand.
You built this program.
Why is it trying to kill us?
You think this is funny?
No.
It's probably not, right?
This is very terrible. Is it so...
Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played
- with something you don't understand.
- No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It is funny. It's a hoot that you
don't get why we need this.
- Tony, maybe this might not be the time.
- Really? That's it?
You just roll over, show your belly
every time somebody snarls?
- Only when I've created a murder bot.
- We didn't.
We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.
The Avengers were supposed
to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.
Anybody remember when
I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?
A hostile alien army came charging
through a hole in space.
We're standing 300 feet below it.
We're the Avengers.
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day, but...
that up there, that's...
that's the endgame.
How were you guys
planning on beating that?
Together.
We'll lose.
Then we'll do that together, too.
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.
The world's a big place.
Let's start making it smaller.
Talk, and if you are wasting our time...
Did you know this church
is in the exact center of the city?
The elders decreed it so that
everyone could be equally close to God.
I like that. The geometry of belief.
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.
Sometimes it's hard.
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.
I'm sure they do.
But you needed something
more than a man.
That's why you let Stark
take the scepter.
I didn't expect,
but I saw Stark's fear.
I knew it would control him.
Make him self-destruct.
Everyone creates the thing they dread.
Men of peace create engines of war.
Invaders create Avengers.
People create...
smaller people?
"Children." I lost the word, there.
Children... designed to supplant them,
to help them... end.
Is that why you've come,
to end the Avengers?
I've come to save the world.
But also... yeah.
We'll move out right away.
This is a start, but there's something
we need to begin the real work.
- All of these are...
- Me.
I have what the Avengers never will.
Harmony.
They're discordant. Disconnected.
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
And make them martyrs?
You need patience.
Need to see the big picture.
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.
I take it out and look at it...
every day.
You lost your parents in the bombings.
I've seen the records.
- The records are not the picture.
- Pietro.
No, please.
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.
When the first shell hits, two floors
below, it makes a hole in the floor.
It's big.
Our parents go in...
and the whole building
starts coming apart.
I grab her,
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.
But it doesn't go off.
It just...
sits there in the rubble.
Three feet from our faces.
And on the side of the shell
is painted one word.
"Stark."
We were trapped for two days.
Every effort to save us,
every shift in the bricks,
I think, "This will set it off."
We wait for two days
for Tony Stark to kill us.
I know what they are.
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.
Now I don't.
We will make it right.
You and I can hurt them.
But you will tear them apart...
from the inside.
He's all over the globe. Robotics labs,
weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs.
Reports of a metal man, or men,
coming in and emptying the place.
- Fatalities?
- Only when engaged.
Mostly guys left in a fugue state
going on about old memories,
worst fears,
and "something too fast to see."
Maximoffs.
That makes sense he'd go to them.
They have someone in common.
Not anymore.
That's a negative. I answer to you.
Yes, ma'am.
Barton. Might have something.
- I gotta go.
- Who was that?
Girlfriend.
- What's this?
- A message.
Ultron killed Strucker.
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.
This is a smoke screen. Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?
Strucker knew something
that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah. Everything
we had on Strucker's been erased.
Not everything.
Known associates.
- Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.
- Well, these people are all horrible.
Wait. I know that guy.
From back in the day. He operates
off the African coast. Black market arms.
There are conventions. All right?
You meet people. I didn't sell him anything.
He was talking about finding something new,
a game-changer. It was all very Ahab.
- This?
- It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.
Those are tattoos, this is a brand.
Yeah. It's a word in an African dialect
meaning "thief."
In a much less friendly way.
- What dialect?
- Wakanada. Wakanda.
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods...
I thought your father said
he got the last of it.
I don't follow.
What comes out of Wakanda?
The strongest metal on Earth.
Where is this guy now?
Don't tell me your men swindled you.
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.
Now, you will make it right,
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.
Now, minister, where were we?
Yeah. The Enhanced.
Strucker's prize pupils.
Do you want a candy?
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.
But then, he knew what kind of world
he was helping create.
Human life. Not a growth market.
You didn't know?
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.
- Everybody is afraid of something.
- Cuttlefish.
Deep sea fish.
They make lights, disco lights...
to hypnotize their prey, and then...
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.
So if you're going to fiddle
with my brain...
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,
then I know you don't do business.
And I know you're not in charge.
And I only deal...
with the man in charge.
There is no man in charge.
Let's talk business.
Upon this rock, I will build my church.
Vibranium.
You know, it came
at great personal cost.
It's worth billions.
Now so are you.
It's all under your dummy holdings.
Finance is so weird.
But I always say, "Keep your friends
rich and your enemies rich
"and wait to find out which is which."
Stark.
- What?
- Tony Stark used to say that.
To me.
- You're one of his.
- What? I'm not...
I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's
puppets? His hollow men?
I mean, look at me. Do I look like
Iron Man? Stark is nothing!
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.
It's just that I don't understand.
Don't compare me with Stark!
It's a thing with me.
Stark is... He's a sickness!
Junior.
You're gonna break your old man's heart.
If I have to.
- Nobody has to break anything.
- Clearly you've never made an omelet.
He beat me by one second.
Yes. He's funny. Mr. Stark.
It's what? Comfortable?
- Like old times?
- This was never my life.
- You two can still walk away from this.
- We will.
I know you've suffered.
Captain America.
God's righteous man.
Pretending you could live without a war.
I can't physically throw up
in my mouth, but...
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."
What's the vibranium for?
I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted
to take this time to explain my evil plan.
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?
- All of them!
- Move! Move! Move!
Stay down, kid.
It's time for some mind games.
Guys? Is this a code green?
- Thor, status.
- The girl tried to warp my mind.
Take special care. I doubt
a human could keep her at bay.
Fortunately, I am mighty.
This is going very well.
I've done the whole mind control thing.
Not a fan.
Yeah, you better run.
Who's ever standing, we got to move!
Guys?
- Again.
- You'll break them.
Only the breakable ones.
You're made of marble.
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.
What if I fail?
You never fail.
Are you ready for our dance?
Is it him?
Is that the first son of Odin?
Heimdall, your eyes.
They see everything.
They see you leading us to Hel.
Wake up!
The war is over, Steve. We can go home.
Imagine it.
- I can still save you!
- We're all dead! Can you not see?
You're a destroyer, Odinson.
See where your power leads.
Sloppy.
Pretending to fail.
The ceremony is necessary...
for you to take your place in the world.
- I have no place in the world.
- Exactly.
- What can I do?
- It hurts.
I'm going to kill him.
- I'll be right back.
- No. I'm all right.
I want...
I want to finish the plan.
I want the big one.
The vibranium is getting away.
- And you're not going anywhere.
- Of course not. I'm already there.
You'll catch on. But first,
you might need to catch Dr. Banner.
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.
That's not gonna happen.
Not for a while.
The whole team is down.
You got no backup here.
I'm calling in Veronica.
We need backup!
Go! Keep moving!
All right, everybody, stand down!
Will you listen to me?
That little witch is messing
with your mind.
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.
You're Bruce Banner. Right, right,
right, don't mention puny Banner.
Okay!
In the back? Dick move, Banner.
Veronica, give me a hand.
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.
Okay, pal,
we're gonna get you out of town.
Not that way, not that way.
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.
Everybody, out!
Going down?
I'm sorry.
Damage report?
That's comprehensive. Show me something.
How quickly can we buy this building?
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!
Flank him, flank him!
The news is loving you guys.
Nobody else is.
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest but it's in the air.
- The Stark Relief Foundation?
- Already on the scene.
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.
Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode
and stay away from here.
So, run and hide?
Until we can find Ultron,
I don't have a lot else to offer.
Neither do we.
- Hey, you wanna switch out?
- No, I'm good.
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time
because we're still a few hours out.
Few hours from where?
A safe house.
- What is this place?
- Safe house.
Let's hope.
Honey?
I'm home.
Hi. Company.
- Sorry, didn't call ahead.
- Hey.
This is an agent of some kind.
Gentlemen, this is Laura.
I know all of your names.
Incoming.
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!
Hey, buddy. How are you guys doing?
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!
- Oh, my goodness.
- Did you bring Auntie Nat?
Why don't you hug her and find out?
Sorry for barging in on you.
Yeah, we would've called ahead, but we were
busy having no idea that you existed.
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.
I'd like to keep it that way.
I figure it's a good place to lay low.
Honey.
I missed you.
- How's little Natasha?
- She's...
Nathaniel.
Traitor.
- Thor?
- I saw something in that dream.
I need answers. I won't find them here.
We can go home.
See? You worried for nothing.
Can't even feel the difference, can you?
If they're sleeping here, some of them
are gonna have to double up.
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?
How long has that been going on?
Has what?
- You are so cute.
- Nat and Banner?
I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.
Well, okay.
It's bad, right?
Nat seems really shaken.
Ultron has these allies.
These kids. They're punks, really.
But they carry a big, damn stick.
And Nat took a serious hit.
Someone's gonna have
to teach them some manners.
That someone being you.
You know I totally support
your avenging.
I couldn't be prouder.
But I see those guys... those gods...
You don't think they need me.
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.
They're a mess.
Yeah.
I guess they're my mess.
You need to be sure
that this team is really a team,
and that they have your back.
Things are changing for us.
In a few months' time, you and me
are gonna be outnumbered.
I need...
Just be sure.
Yes, ma'am.
I can feel the difference.
Scream, and your entire staff dies.
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met. I didn't.
- Do you expect a thank-you note?
- I expect you to know why.
The Cradle.
This is the next thing, Tony.
This is the next me.
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.
It can't build a living body.
It can. You can. You lack the materials.
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.
But we all have room to improve.
I didn't realize you were waiting.
I would've joined you, but...
it didn't seem like the right time.
They used up all the hot water.
- I should've joined you.
- Missed our window.
Did we?
The world just saw the Hulk.
The real Hulk, for the first time.
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?
I had this dream.
The kind that seems normal at the time,
- but when you wake...
- What did you dream?
That I was an Avenger.
That I was anything more
than the assassin they made me.
I think you're being hard on yourself.
Here I was hoping that was your job.
What are you doing?
I'm running with it.
With you.
If running is the plan,
as far as you want.
Are you out of your mind?
- I want you to understand that...
- Natasha,
where can I go?
Where in the world am I not a threat?
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?
Even if I didn't just...
There's no future with me.
I can't ever... I can't have this.
Kids.
Do the math. I physically can't.
Neither can I.
In the Red Room where I was trained...
where I was raised,
they have a graduation ceremony.
They sterilize you.
It's efficient.
One less thing to worry about.
The one thing that might matter more
than a mission.
Makes everything easier.
Even killing.
You still think you're
the only monster on the team?
So, we disappear?
Thor didn't say where
he was going for answers?
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.
Yeah, give him time.
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.
"Earth's mightiest heroes."
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.
Seems like you walked away all right.
- Is that a problem?
- I don't trust a guy without a dark side.
Call me old-fashioned.
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?
Well, I guess you'd know. Whether
you'd tell us is a bit of a question.
- Banner and I were doing research.
- That would affect the team.
That would end the team!
Isn't that the mission?
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"? So we can
end the fight. So we get to go home!
Every time someone tries to win a war
before it starts, innocent people die.
Every time.
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...
Clint said you wouldn't mind, but our tractor
doesn't seem to want to start at all.
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.
Don't take from my pile.
Hello, Deere.
Tell me everything.
What ails you?
Do me a favor.
Try not to bring it to life.
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?
- Was she ever not working for you?
- Artificial intelligence.
- You never even hesitated.
- Look, it's been a really long day,
like Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.
- You're not the director of me.
- I'm not the director of anybody.
I'm just an old man
who cares very much about you.
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.
I saw it. I didn't tell the team.
How could I?
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.
The whole world, too.
Because of me.
I wasn't ready.
I didn't do all I could.
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.
The end of the path I started us on.
You come up with some
pretty impressive inventions, Tony.
War isn't one of them.
I watched my friends die. You'd think
that'd be as bad as it gets, right?
Nope.
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part... is that you didn't.
I'll see you tonight.
I like the look.
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.
- I need your help.
- It's nice to be needed.
It's dangerous.
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.
My contacts all say
he's building something.
The amount of vibranium he made off with,
I don't think it's just one thing.
- What about Ultron himself?
- He's easy to track. He's everywhere.
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.
Is he still going after launch codes?
Yes, he is.
But he's not making any headway.
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.
- Nexus?
- It's the world internet hub in Oslo.
Every byte of data flows through there.
Fastest access on Earth.
- So, what did they say?
- He's fixated on the missiles.
But the codes
are constantly being changed.
By whom?
- Parties unknown.
- Do we have an ally?
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.
I might need to visit Oslo.
Find our unknown.
Well, this is good times, boss,
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,
- you'd have more than that.
- I do. I have you.
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.
Ears, everywhere else.
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.
Here we all are, back on Earth,
with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world.
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing
between him and his mission.
And whether or not he admits it,
his mission is global destruction.
All this, laid in a grave.
So stand.
Outwit the platinum bastard.
- Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
- You know what, Romanoff?
So, what does he want?
To become better.
Better than us.
He keeps building bodies.
Person bodies.
The human form is inefficient.
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.
But he keeps coming back to it.
When you two programmed him to protect
the human race, you amazingly failed.
They don't need to be protected.
They need to evolve.
- Ultron's going to evolve.
- How?
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?
It's beautiful.
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible
with the tissue cells, they're binding them.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to...
- The most versatile substance on the planet,
and they used it to make a Frisbee.
Typical of humans.
They scratch the surface
and never think...
to look within.
I'll take Natasha and Clint.
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit
the Nexus. I'll join you as soon as I can.
- If Ultron's really building a body...
- He'll be more powerful than any of us.
Maybe all of us.
An android designed by a robot.
You know, I really miss the days when the
weirdest thing science ever created was me.
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
She's all yours. Apparently.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom
as soon as I get back.
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.
No.
It's the last project.
I promise.
So, this is it.
The Water of Sight.
In every realm, there's a reflection.
If the water's spirits accept me,
I can return to my dream...
and find what I missed.
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.
A hacker who's faster than Ultron?
He could be anywhere.
And as this is the center of everything,
I'm just a guy looking for a needle
in the world's biggest haystack.
How do you find it?
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.
I'm decrypting nuclear codes
And you don't want me to
Come and get me.
Wake up!
Thor!
Extinction.
Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.
We're uploading your cerebral matrix...
now.
I can read him.
- He's dreaming.
- I wouldn't call it dreams.
It's Ultron's base consciousness.
- Informational noise. Soon...
- How soon? I'm not being pushy.
We're imprinting a physical brain.
There are no shortcuts.
Even if your magic gem...
- How could you?
- How could I what?
You said we would destroy the Avengers,
- make a better world.
- It will be better.
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.
- And if they don't?
- Ask Noah.
You are a madman.
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.
When the Earth starts to settle,
God throws a stone at it.
And, believe me, he's winding up.
We have to evolve.
There's no room for... the weak.
And who decides who's weak?
Life.
Life always decides.
There's incoming.
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.
Wait, guys!
They'll understand.
When they see, they'll understand.
I just need a little more time.
Two minutes. Stay close.
Dr. Cho!
- He's uploading himself into the body.
- Where?
The real power is inside the Cradle.
The gem... its power is uncontainable.
You can't just blow it up.
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.
- First, I have to find it.
- Go.
- Did you guys copy that?
- We did.
I got a private jet
taking off across town.
No manifest. That could be him.
There. It's a truck from the lab.
Right above you, Cap.
On the loop by the bridge.
It's them. You got three
with the Cradle, one in the cab.
- I could take out the driver.
- Negative.
That truck crashes,
the gem could level the city.
We need to draw out Ultron.
No, no, no, no.
Leave me alone!
Well, he's definitely unhappy.
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.
You're not a match for him, Cap.
Thanks, Barton.
You know what's in that cradle?
The power to make real change.
And that terrifies you.
I wouldn't call it a comfort.
Stop it.
We got a window. Four, three...
Give him hell.
I'm always picking up after you boys.
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.
- Which way?
- Hard right.
Now.
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!
Come on!
- Clint, can you draw out the guards?
- Let's find out.
Beep, beep!
They're heading back towards you.
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.
I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?
What do you think I've been doing?
Okay, package is airborne.
- I have a clean shot.
- Negative. I am still in the truck.
- What the hell are you...
- Be ready. I'm sending the package to you.
How do you want me to take it?
You might wish you hadn't asked that.
- Please, don't do this.
- What choice do we have?
I lost him! He's headed your way!
Nat, we gotta go.
Nat!
Cap, you see Nat?
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!
- Do you have eyes on Nat?
- Go!
Damn it.
Civilians in our path.
Can you stop this thing?
I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
I'm very tempted not to give you one.
- The Cradle. Did you get it?
- Stark will take care of it.
No, he won't.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Stark's not crazy.
He will do anything
to make things right.
Stark, come in. Stark.
Anyone on comms.
Ultron can't tell the difference
between saving the world and destroying it.
Where do you think he gets that?
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.
But she's alive, or Ultron
would be rubbing our faces in it.
This is sealed tight.
We're gonna need to access the program,
break it down from within.
Any chance Natasha might leave you
a message outside the Internet?
- Old-school spy stuff?
- There are some nets I can cast.
Yeah, I'll find her.
I can work on tissue degeneration
if you could fry
whatever operational system
Cho implanted.
Yeah, about that.
- No.
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.
- Our ally...
the guy protecting the military's
nuclear codes,
- I found him.
- Hello, Dr. Banner.
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.
He attacked him because he was scared
of what he can do.
So Jarvis went underground.
Scattered, dumped his memory.
But not his protocols.
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.
So,
you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?
No! Of course not. I wanna
help you put Jarvis in this thing.
We're out of my field, here.
You know bio-organics better than anyone.
And you just assume that Jarvis's
operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
Jarvis has been beating him from inside
without knowing it.
This is the opportunity.
We can create Ultron's perfect self
without the homicidal glitches he thinks
are his winning personality. We have to.
I believe it's worth a go.
I'm in a loop!
I'm caught in a time loop.
- This is exactly where it all went wrong.
- I know. I know.
I know what everyone's gonna say.
But they're already saying it.
We're mad scientists.
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.
Make a stand.
It's not a loop.
It's the end of the line.
I wasn't sure you would wake up.
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.
I don't have anyone else.
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.
Boom! The end. Start again.
The world made clean
for the new man to rebuild.
I was meant to be new.
I was meant to be beautiful.
The world would have looked
to the sky and seen hope,
seen mercy.
Instead, they'll look up in horror
because of you.
You've wounded me.
I give you full marks for that.
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...
just makes me stronger.
- This framework is not compatible.
- The genetic coding tower is at 97%.
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.
- You don't know what you're doing.
- And you do?
She's not in your head?
- I know you're angry.
- We're way past that.
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.
- Banner, after everything that's hap...
- It's nothing compared to what's coming!
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!
No, no. Go on.
You were saying?
Pietro!
What? You didn't see that coming?
I'm rerouting the upload.
Go ahead, piss me off.
Wait!
I am sorry. That was...
odd.
Thank you.
Thor.
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its center is that.
What? The gem?
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.
The greatest power in the universe,
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.
It's definitely the end times.
- The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
- Not alone.
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix...
to create something new.
I think I've had my fill of new.
You think I'm a child of Ultron.
You're not?
I'm not Ultron.
I am not Jarvis. I am...
I am.
I looked in your head
and saw annihilation.
- Look again.
- Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,
Ultron himself,
they all came from the Mind Stone.
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?
Are you?
On our side?
I don't think it's that simple.
Well, it better get
real simple real soon.
I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't.
- He will end it all.
- What's he waiting for?
- You.
- Where?
Sokovia. He's got Nat there, too.
If we're wrong about you,
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...
What will you do?
I don't want to kill Ultron.
He's unique and he's in pain.
But that pain will roll over the Earth.
So, he must be destroyed.
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.
We have to act now.
And not one of us can do it
without the others.
Maybe I am a monster.
I don't think I'd know if I were one.
I'm not what you are,
and not what you intended.
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.
But we need to go.
Right.
Well done.
Three minutes. Get what you need.
Good evening, boss.
No way we all get through this.
If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.
- There's gonna be blood on the floor.
- I got no plans tomorrow night.
I get first crack at the big guy.
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
That's true. He hates you the most.
Ultron knows we're coming.
Odds are we'll be riding
into heavy fire.
And that's what we signed up for.
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.
So our priority is getting them out.
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!
Get off your asses.
All they want is to live
their lives in peace.
And that's not gonna happen today.
But we can do our best to protect them.
And we can get the job done.
We find out what Ultron's been building,
we find Romanoff,
and we clear the field.
Keep the fight between us.
Ultron thinks we're monsters.
That we're what's wrong with the world.
This isn't just about beating him.
It's about whether he's right.
Natasha! Natasha!
Bruce?
- You all right?
- Yeah.
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.
Yeah. I did.
So what's our play?
- I'm here to get you to safety.
- Job's not finished.
We could help with the evacuation,
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.
And you've done plenty.
Our fight is over.
So, we just disappear?
Come on.
Your man's in the church, boss.
I think he's waiting for you.
Come to confess your sins?
- I don't know. How much time you got?
- More than you.
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."
You're stalling to protect the people.
Well, that is the mission.
Did you forget?
I've moved beyond your mission.
I'm free.
What?
You think you were
the only one stalling?
There's the rest of the vibranium.
Function, still unclear.
This is how you end, Tony.
This is peace in my time.
Go!
Get off the bridge!
Run!
Ultron.
My Vision. They really did
take everything from me.
- You set the terms. You can change them.
- All right.
- Friday, the Vision?
- Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.
He won't escape through there.
You shut me out.
You think I care?
You take away my world...
I take away yours.
- Friday.
- Sokovia is going for a ride.
Do you see...
the beauty of it?
The inevitability.
You rise, only to fall.
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.
My swift and terrible sword.
And the earth will crack
with the weight of your failure.
Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.
It means nothing.
When the dust settles,
the only thing living in this world...
will be metal.
- We gotta move.
- You're not gonna turn green?
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.
I adore you.
But I need the other guy.
Let's finish the job.
I really hope this makes us even.
Now go be a hero.
The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.
That's what's keeping the rock together.
- If it drops?
- Right now, the impact can kill thousands.
Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.
That building's not clear.
The 10th floor.
Hi.
Okay. Get in the tub!
I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.
- Cap, you got incoming.
- Incoming already came in.
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.
The rest of us have one job,
tear these things apart.
You get hurt, hurt them back.
You get killed... walk it off.
Go, go, go!
- How could I let this happen?
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.
- Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.
Who cares? Are you up for this?
Are you?
Look, I just need to know.
Because the city is flying.
Okay. Look, the city is flying,
we're fighting an army of robots,
and I have a bow and arrow.
None of this makes sense.
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.
It doesn't matter what you did
or what you were.
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.
But if you step out that door,
you are an Avenger.
All right. Good chat.
Yeah, the city is flying.
I got you!
Just look at me!
You can't save them all.
You'll never...
"Never" what? You didn't finish!
What, were you napping?
Thor.
You're bothering me.
- All right, we're all clear here.
- We are not clear! We are very not clear!
All right, coming to you.
Keep up, old man!
Nobody would know.
Nobody.
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.
"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick
little bastard. I miss him already."
Hold your fire!
Romanoff!
Thanks!
The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.
Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.
- The city's not coming down slow.
- Spire is vibranium.
- If I get Thor to hit it...
- It will crack. That's not enough.
- The impact would still be devastating.
- Maybe if we can cap the other end.
- Keep the atomic action doubling back.
- That could vaporize the city.
And everyone on it.
The next wave is gonna hit any minute.
What do you got, Stark?
Nothing great.
Maybe a way to blow up the city.
That'll keep it from impacting the surface,
if you guys can get clear.
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.
Impact radius is getting bigger every second.
We're gonna have to make a choice.
Cap, these people are going nowhere.
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.
I didn't say we should leave.
There's worse ways to go.
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?
Glad you like the view, Romanoff.
It's about to get better.
Nice, right?
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.
- She's dusty, but she'll do.
- Fury, you son of a bitch.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.
Lifeboats secure to deploy.
Disengage in three, two...
take them out.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.
This is not so bad.
Let's load them up.
Sir, we have multiple bogies
converging on our starboard flank.
- Show 'em what we got.
- You're up.
Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
Yup. If you live to tell it.
- You think I can't hold my own?
- We get through this, I'll hold your own.
You had to make it weird.
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.
- Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.
- Let's go, everyone!
Number six boat is topped and locked...
or stocked... topped...
It's full of people.
Incoming!
Oh, God!
You think you're saving anyone?
I turn that key and drop this rock
a little early and it's still billions dead.
- Even you can't stop that.
- I am Thor, son of Odin,
and as long as there is life
in my breast...
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?
It's terribly well-balanced.
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...
I got it. Create a heat seal.
I could... I could supercharge
the spire from below.
Running numbers.
A heat seal could work
with enough power.
- Thor, I got a plan.
- We're out of time.
They're coming for the core.
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.
- Are you good?
- Yeah.
Romanoff.
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."
Relax, shellhead. Not all of us can fly.
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.
Is that the best you can do?
You had to ask.
This is the best I can do.
This is exactly what I wanted.
All of you against all of me.
How can you possibly hope to stop me?
Well, like the old man said...
together.
You know, with the benefit
of hindsight...
- They'll try to leave the city.
- We can't let them, not even one.
- Rhodey.
- I'm on it.
No. I didn't say you could leave.
War Machine coming at you! Right...
Okay, what?
We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air
is getting thin. You guys get to the boats.
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.
It's my job.
Nat? This way.
Get the people on the boats.
- I'm not going to leave you here.
- I can handle this.
Come back for me when
everyone else is off. Not before.
You understand?
- You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.
- Go.
- Boss, power levels are way below...
- Reroute everything. We get one shot at this.
I know what I need to do.
The dining room.
If I knock out that east wall, it'd make
a nice workspace for Laura, huh?
Put up some baffling. She can't hear
the kids running around. What do you think?
- You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
- No one eats in a dining room.
- We don't have a lot of time.
- So get your ass on a boat.
Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.
Secure your gear, find a seat.
Costel!
We were in the market.
Costel!
Thor, I'm gonna need you
back in the church.
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
You know, this works,
we maybe don't walk away.
Maybe not.
I got no strings, so I have fun
I'm not tied up to anyone
Come on. Time to go.
You didn't see that coming?
For God's sake.
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!
No, no, I'm fine. Fine.
It's been a long day.
Wanda.
If you stay here...
you'll die.
I just did. Do you know how it felt?
It felt like that.
Thor, on my mark.
Now!
Hey, big guy.
We did it. The job is finished.
Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode.
So help me out. I need you...
You're afraid.
- Of you?
- Of death.
You're the last one.
You were supposed to be the last.
Stark asked for a savior
and settled for a slave.
I suppose we are both disappointments.
- I suppose we are.
- Humans are odd.
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites and...
try to control what won't be.
But there is grace in their failings.
I think you missed that.
- They're doomed.
- Yes.
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.
It's a privilege to be among them.
You're unbearably naive.
Well...
I was born yesterday.
Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!
Fat.
One of our tech boys flagged this.
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.
Could be the Quinjet.
But with Stark's stealth tech,
we still can't track the damn thing.
Right.
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.
He'll send a postcard.
"Wish you were here."
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.
Did you know then what was gonna happen?
You never know.
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.
I got a great team.
Nothing lasts forever.
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.
The rules have changed.
- We're dealing with something new.
- The Vision is artificial intelligence.
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?
No, it's not like a person
lifting the hammer.
Right, different rules for us.
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.
It's safe with the Vision.
And these days, safe is in short supply.
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.
I'm gonna miss
these little talks of ours.
- Not if you don't leave.
- I have no choice.
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity
Stones to show up in the last few years.
It's not a coincidence.
Someone has been playing
an intricate game and has made pawns of us.
And once all these pieces
are in position...
Triple Yahtzee.
- You think you can find out what's coming?
- I do.
Besides this one, there's nothing
that can't be explained.
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.
- I will miss you, Tony.
- Yeah?
Well, it's time for me to tap out.
Maybe I should take a page
out of Barton's book.
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.
- The simple life.
- You'll get there one day.
I don't know. Family, stability...
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.
I think someone else came out.
You all right?
I'm home.
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.
I thought you and Tony were still gazing
into each other's eyes. How do we look?
- Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
- We got some hitters.
- They're good. They're not a team.
- Let's beat them into shape.
Avengers...
Fine.
I'll do it myself.

Good morning, Soldier.
Ready to comply.
I have a mission for you.
Sanction and extract.
No witnesses.
Well done Soldier.
All right, what do you see?
Standard beat cops.
Small station.
Quiet street.
It's a good target.
There's an ATM on the
south corner, which means?
Cameras.
Both cross streets are one-way.
So, compromised escape routes.
Means our guy doesn't
care about being seen.
He isn't afraid
to make a mess on the way out.
You see that Range Rover
halfway up the block?
Yeah, the red one? It's cute.
It's also bulletproof,
which means private security...
which means more guns, which means more
headaches for somebody. Probably us.
You guys know
I can move things with my mind, right?
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become second nature.
Anybody ever tell you
you're a little paranoid?
Not to my face.
Why? Did you hear something?
Eyes on target, folks.
This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow
in six months. I don't want to lose him.
If he sees us coming,
that won't be a problem.
He kind of hates us.
Sam...
see that garbage truck?
Tag it.
Give me X-ray.
That truck's loaded for max weight.
And the driver's armed.
It's a battering ram.
- Go now.
- What?
He's not hitting the police.
Body armour, AR-15s.
I make seven hostiles.
I make five.
Sam.
Four.
Rumlow's on the third floor.
Wanda, just like we practised.
What about the gas?
Get it out.
Pack it up.
He's here.
Rumlow has a biological weapon.
I'm on it.
I don't work like that no more.
Fire in the hole.
No!
Sam.
He's in an AFV heading north.
Take this to the airstrip.
We're not gonna outrun them.
Lose the truck.
Where are you going to meet us?
I'm not.
I've got four, they're splitting up.
I got the two on the left.
They ditched their gear.
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.
There you are, you son of a bitch.
I've been waiting for this.
He doesn't have it.
I'm empty!
Out of the way!
Drop it.
Or I'll drop this.
- Drop it!
- He'll do it!
Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
Don't thank me.
I'm not thanking that thing.
His name is Redwing.
I'm still not thanking it.
He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
Come on!
This is for dropping
a building on my face.
Ahh!
I think I look pretty good,
all things considered.
Who's your buyer?
You know, he knew you.
Your pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
What did you say?
He remembered you.
I was there. He got all weepy about it.
Till they put his brain back in a blender.
He wanted you to know something.
He said to me...
"Please tell Rogers.
"When you gotta go...
"you gotta go."
And you're coming with me.
Oh, my...
Sam...
we need Fire and Rescue
on the south side of the building.
We gotta get up there.
Try to remember the kind of September
When grass was green
Wake up, dear,
and say goodbye to your father.
Who's the homeless person on the couch?
This is why
I love coming home for Christmas...
right before you leave town.
Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Really? Which broad? What's her name?
Candice.
Do me a favour?
Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.
Okay, so it's Monday.
That is good to know,
I will plan my toga party accordingly.
Where you going?
Your father's flying us
to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
We might have to make a quick stop.
At the Pentagon. Right?
Don't worry, you're gonna love
the holiday menu at the commissary.
They say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.
If that's true,
you'll be a great man someday.
I'll get the bags.
He does miss you when you're not here.
And frankly, you're going to miss us.
Because this is the last time
we're all going to be together.
You know what's about to happen.
Say something.
If you don't, you'll regret it.
I love you, Dad.
And I know you did the best you could.
That's how I wish it happened.
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing...
or BARF.
God, I gotta work on that acronym.
An extremely costly method
of hijacking the hippocampus...
to clear traumatic memories.
Huh.
It doesn't change the fact that they
never made it to the airport...
or all the things I did to avoid
processing my grief, but...
Plus, $611 million for my
little therapeutic experiment?
No one in their right mind
would've ever funded it.
Help me out,
what's the MIT mission statement?
"To generate, disseminate...
"and preserve knowledge.
"And work with others...
"to bring it to bear on
the world's great challenges."
Well, you are the others.
And, quiet as it's kept...
the challenges facing you
are the greatest mankind's ever known.
Plus, most of you are broke.
Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were.
As of this moment...
every student has been made
an equal recipient...
of the inaugural
September Foundation Grant.
As in...
all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.
No strings, no taxes...
just reframe the future!
Starting now.
Go break some eggs.
Wow. Wow.
That took my breath away.
Oh, Tony! So generous.
So much money! Wow!
Out of curiosity...
will any portion of that grant
be made available to faculty?
I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out.
I have got this killer idea
for a self-cooking hotdog.
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...
Restroom's this way, yeah?
Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
Mr Stark, I am so sorry
about the teleprompter.
I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled.
They didn't have time to fix it.
It's fine. I'll be right back.
We'll catch up later.
That was nice,
what you did for those young people.
Ah, they deserve it.
Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
They say there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.
But if you've got the money...
break as many eggs as you like.
Right?
Are you going up?
I'm right where I want to be.
Okay. Hey.
Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
I work for the State Department.
Human Resources.
I know it's boring...
but it enabled me to raise a son.
I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
His name was Charlie Spencer.
You murdered him.
In Sokovia.
Not that that matters in the least to you.
You think you fight for us?
You just fight for yourself.
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?
He's dead...
and I blame you.
11 Wakandans were among
those killed during a confrontation...
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries...
in Lagos, Nigeria last month.
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans
were on an outreach mission...
in Lagos, when the attack occurred.
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil...
not only because of
the actions of criminals...
but by the indifference
of those pledged to stop them.
Victory at the expense of the innocent...
is no victory at all.
The Wakandan king went on to...
They are operating outside
and above the international law.
Because that's the reality,
if we don't respond to acts like these.
What legal authority does an enhanced
individual like Wanda Maximoff have...
to operate in Nigeri...?
It's my fault.
That's not true.
Turn the TV back on.
They're being very specific.
I should've clocked that bomb vest
long before you had to deal with it.
Rumlow said "Bucky"...
and all of a sudden
I was a 16-year-old kid again,
in Brooklyn.
And people died.
It's on me.
It's on both of us.
This job...
We try to save as many people as we can.
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody.
But if we can't find a way
to live with that...
then next time...
maybe nobody gets saved.
Vis! We talked about this.
Yes, but the door was open
so I assumed that...
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr Stark was arriving.
Thank you. We'll be right down.
I'll use the door.
Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
We know who it is?
The Secretary of State.
Five years ago...
I had a heart attack...
and dropped right in
the middle of my backswing.
Turned out it was the best
round of my life...
because after 13 hours
of surgery and a triple bypass...
I found something 40 years
in the Army had never taught me.
Perspective.
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.
You have fought for us...
protected us, risked your lives...
but while a great many people
see you as heroes...
there are some...
who would prefer the word "vigilantes."
What word would you use, Mr Secretary?
How about "dangerous"?
What would you call a group
of US-based, enhanced individuals...
who routinely ignore sovereign borders...
and inflict their will
wherever they choose...
and who, frankly, seem unconcerned
about what they leave behind?
New York.
Washington, D.C.
Sokovia.
Lagos.
Okay. That's enough.
For the past four years,
you've operated with unlimited power...
and no supervision.
That's an arrangement the governments
of the world can no longer tolerate.
But I think we have a solution.
The Sokovia Accords.
Approved by 117 countries...
it states that the Avengers
shall no longer be a private organisation.
Instead...
they'll operate under the supervision
of a United Nations panel...
only when and if that panel
deems it necessary.
The Avengers were formed to
make the world a safer place.
I feel we've done that.
Tell me, Captain, do you know
where Thor and Banner are right now?
If I misplaced a couple of
30 megaton nukes...
you can bet there'd be consequences.
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.
Believe me, this is the middle ground.
So, there are contingencies.
Three days from now,
the UN meets in Vienna...
to ratify the Accords.
Talk it over.
And if we come
to a decision you don't like?
Then you retire.
Hello?
Is this your car out front?
I jumped the kerb.
Maybe we could...
take care of it ourselves.
If you wanna call the cops,
that's okay, too...
- I guess.
- No.
No cops.
Thank you.
You have kept your looks, Colonel.
Congratulations.
"Mission report. December 16, 1991."
Who are you?
My name is Zemo.
I will repeat my question.
Mission report, December 16, 1991.
How did you find me?
When S.H.I.E.L.D. fell...
Black Widow released
HYDRA files to the public.
Millions of pages. Much of it encrypted.
Not easy to decipher.
But, I have experience.
And patience.
A man can do anything if he has those.
What do you want?
Mission report.
December 16.
Go... to... hell!
HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap.
So your death would not bother me.
But I'd have to use this book...
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.
I don't look forward to that.
You'd only be dying for...
your pride.
Hail HYDRA.
Secretary Ross has
a Congressional Medal of Honour...
which is one more than you have.
So let's say we agree to this thing.
How long is it gonna be before they
LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
117 countries want to sign this.
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, that's cool. We got it."
How long are you going to play both sides?
I have an equation.
Oh, this will clear it up.
In the eight years since Mr Stark
announced himself as Iron Man...
the number of known enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.
During the same period...
the number of potentially
world-ending events
has risen at a commensurate rate.
Are you saying it's our fault?
I'm saying there may be a causality.
Our very strength invites challenge.
Challenge incites conflict.
And conflict...
breeds catastrophe.
Oversight...
Oversight is not an idea that
can be dismissed out of hand.
Boom.
Tony.
You are being uncharacteristically
non-hyperverbal.
It's because he's already
made up his mind.
Boy, you know me so well.
Actually, I'm nursing
an electromagnetic headache.
That's what's going on, Cap.
It's just pain.
It's discomfort.
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?
Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way.
He's a great kid.
Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA...
had a floor-level gig
at Intel planned for the fall.
But first, he wanted to put
a few miles on his soul...
before he parked it
behind a desk. See the world.
Maybe be of service.
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or
Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do.
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam,
which sounds fun.
He decided to spend his summer building
sustainable housing for the poor.
Guess where. Sokovia.
He wanted to make a difference, I suppose.
We won't know because we dropped
a building on him while we were kicking ass.
There's no decision-making process here.
We need to be put in check!
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.
If we can't accept limitations,
if we're boundary-less...
we're no better than the bad guys.
Tony, someone dies on your watch,
you don't give up.
Who said we're giving up?
We are if we're not
taking responsibility for our actions.
This document just shifts the blame.
I'm sorry, Steve.
That is dangerously arrogant.
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.
It's not the World Security Council,
it's not S.H.I.E.L.D., it's not HYDRA.
No, but it's run by people
with agendas, and agendas change.
That's good. That's why I'm here.
When I realised what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands...
I shut it down and stopped manufacturing.
Tony, you chose to do that.
If we sign this, we surrender
our right to choose.
What if this panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go?
What if there is somewhere we need
to go and they don't let us?
We may not be perfect,
but the safest hands are still our own.
If we don't do this now,
it's gonna be done to us later.
That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
You're saying they'll come for me.
We would protect you.
Maybe Tony's right.
If we have one hand on the wheel,
we can still steer. If we take it off...
Aren't you the same woman who told the
government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
I'm just reading the terrain.
We have made some very public mistakes.
We need to win their trust back.
Focus up. I'm sorry.
Did I just mishear you...
- or did you agree with me?
- I want to take it back now.
No, you can't retract it.
Thank you. Unprecedented.
Okay. Case closed. I win.
I have to go.
And now, I would like
to invite Sharon Carter
to come up and say a few words.
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D...
but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
She had a photograph in her office.
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.
As a kid, that was pretty cool.
But it was a lot to live up to.
Which is why I never told
anyone we were related.
I asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage...
in a time when no one wanted to see
a woman succeed at either.
She said, compromise where you can.
But where you can't, don't.
Even if everyone is telling you
that something wrong is something right.
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move...
it is your duty to plant
yourself like a tree...
look them in the eye and say
"No, you move."
When I came out of the ice, I thought
everyone I had known was gone.
Then I found out she was alive.
I was just lucky to have her.
She had you back, too.
Who else signed?
Tony, Rhodey, Vision.
Clint?
Says he's retired.
- Wanda?
- TBD.
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.
There's plenty of room on the jet.
Just because it's the path
of least resistance...
doesn't mean it's the wrong path.
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.
What are we giving up to do it?
I'm sorry, Nat.
I can't sign it.
I know.
Then what are you doing here?
I didn't want you to be alone.
Come here.
At a special United Nations conference...
117 countries have come together
to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
Excuse me, Ms Romanoff?
- Yes?
- These need your signature.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spotlight.
Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
You seem to be doing all right so far.
Considering your last trip
to Capitol Hill...
I wouldn't think you'd be particularly
comfortable in this company.
Well, I'm not.
And that alone makes me glad
you are here, Ms Romanoff.
Why? You don't approve of all this?
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.
Two people in a room can get
more done than a hundred.
Unless you need to move a piano.
Ms Romanoff.
King T'Chaka.
Please, allow me to apologise
for what happened in Nigeria.
Thank you.
Thank you for agreeing to all of this.
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.
Yes, so am I.
If everyone could please be seated.
This assembly is now in session.
That is the future calling.
Such a pleasure.
Thank you.
For a man who disapproves of diplomacy,
you're getting quite good at it.
I'm happy, Father.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When stolen Wakandan vibranium
was used to make a terrible weapon...
we in Wakanda were forced
to question our legacy.
Those men and women killed in Nigeria...
were part of a goodwill mission
from a country too long in the shadows.
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.
We will fight to improve
the world we wish to join.
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.
Wakanda is proud
to extend its hand in peace.
Everybody get down!
My mom tried
to talk me out of enlisting...
but, um, not Aunt Peggy.
She bought me my first thigh holster.
Very practical.
And stylish.
CIA has you stationed over here now?
Berlin. Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Right. Right. Sounds fun.
I know, right?
I've been meaning to ask you.
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...
You mean when I was doing my job.
Did Peggy know?
She kept so many secrets.
I didn't want her to have one from you.
Thanks for walking me back.
Sure.
Steve.
There's something you gotta see.
A bomb hidden in a news van...
Who's coordinating?
...ripped through
the UN building in Vienna.
Good. They're solid. Forensics?
More than 70 people have been injured.
At least 12 are dead,
including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.
Officials have released
a video of a suspect...
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...
the Winter Soldier.
The infamous HYDRA agent...
linked to numerous acts of terrorism
and political assassinations.
I have to go to work.
Call MI6, see if we can get
Micro Forensics to hurry this up.
We need the whole team here
in two hours or it's not worth it.
I'm very sorry.
In my culture...
death is not the end.
It's more of a stepping-off point.
You reach out with both hands...
and Bast and Sekhmet,
they lead you into the green veldt...
where you can run forever.
That sounds very peaceful.
My father thought so.
I am not my father.
T'Challa...
Task Force will decide
who brings in Barnes.
Don't bother, Ms Romanoff.
I'll kill him myself.
Yeah?
You all right?
Uh, yeah, thanks. I got lucky.
I know how much Barnes
means to you. I really do.
Stay home. You'll only make this worse.
For all of us.
Please.
Are you saying you'll arrest me?
No.
Someone will.
If you interfere. That's how it works now.
If he's this far gone, Nat,
I should be the one to bring him in.
Why?
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.
Shit.
She tell you to stay out of it?
Might have a point.
He'd do it for me.
1945, maybe.
I just want to make sure
we consider all our options.
The people that shoot at you
usually wind up shooting at me.
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.
Everybody thinks
the Winter Soldier goes to their gym.
Most of it's noise.
Except for this.
My boss expects a briefing,
pretty much now...
so that's all the head start
you're gonna get.
Thank you.
You're gonna have to hurry.
We have orders to shoot on sight.
Homecoming

Freight car
I have your breakfast.
I could smell it before I opened the door.
Side of bacon and black coffee.
Again.
I can make you something
different, if you like.
This is wonderful...
I will just put this on your...
It's okay, I can manage!
Heads up, Cap.
German Special Forces,
approaching from the south.
Understood.
Do you know me?
You're Steve.
I read about you in a museum.
They've set the perimeter.
I know you're nervous,
and you have plenty of reason to be.
But you're lying.
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that any more.
They're entering the building.
Well, the people
who think you did are coming here now.
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.
That's smart.
Good strategy.
They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
This doesn't have to end in a fight, Buck.
- It always ends in a fight.
- Five seconds.
You pulled me from the river.
Why?
- I don't know.
- Three seconds.
Yes, you do.
Breach! Breach! Breach!
Buck, stop!
You're gonna kill someone.
I'm not gonna kill anyone.
Suspect has broken containment!
...he's headed down the east stairwell!
Come on, man.
Ahhh!
Sam, southwest rooftop.
Who the hell's the other guy?
About to find out.
- Sam.
- Got him.
Stand down!
Stand down!
Sam, I can't shake this guy.
Right behind you.
Stand down, now.
Congratulations, Cap.
You're a criminal.
Your Highness.
"A pinch of paprika."
A pinch.
Is that paprikash?
I thought it might lift your spirits.
Spirits lifted.
In my defence, I haven't actually
ever eaten anything before, so...
May I?
Please.
- Wanda?
- Hmm.
No one dislikes you, Wanda.
Thanks.
Oh, you're welcome.
No, it's a involuntary response
in their amygdala.
They can't help but be afraid of you.
Are you?
My amygdala is synthetic, so...
I used to think of myself one way.
But after this...
I am something else.
I'm still me, I think, but...
that's not what everyone else sees.
Do you know, I don't know what this is?
Not really.
I know it's not of this world...
that it powered Loki's staff,
gave you your abilities, but...
its true nature is a mystery.
And yet, it is part of me.
Are you afraid of it?
I wish to understand it.
The more I do, the less it controls me.
One day... who knows?
I may even control it.
I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.
I'm gonna go to the store.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
Vision, are you not letting me leave?
It is a question of safety.
I can protect myself.
Not yours.
Mr Stark would like to avoid
the possibility of another public incident.
Until the Accords are on
a more secure foundation.
And what do you want?
For people to see you...
as I do.
So, you like cats?
- Sam.
- What?
Dude shows up dressed like a cat,
you don't wanna know more?
Your suit... it's vibranium?
The Black Panther has been the protector
of Wakanda for generations.
A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior.
And now, because your friend
murdered my father...
I also wear the mantle of king.
So, I ask you...
as both warrior and king...
how long do you think you can
keep your friend safe from me?
What's gonna happen to him?
Same thing that ought to happen to you.
Psychological evaluation and extradition.
This is Everett Ross,
Deputy Task Force Commander.
What about a lawyer?
Lawyer. That's funny.
See their weapons are placed in lockup.
We'll write you a receipt.
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.
You'll be provided
with an office instead of a cell.
Now, do me a favour, stay in it?
I don't intend on going anywhere.
For the record, this is what
making things worse looks like.
He's alive.
No.
Romania was not Accords-sanctioned.
Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.
Consequences? You bet
there'll be consequences.
Obviously you can quote me on that,
because I just said it. Anything else?
Thank you, sir.
"Consequences"?
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted.
Had to give him something.
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
Technically, it's the
government's property.
Wings, too.
That's cold.
Warmer than jail.
Hey, you wanna see something cool?
I pulled something from Dad's archives.
Felt timely.
FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill
with these in 1941.
Provided support to the Allies
when they needed it most.
Some would say it brought
our country closer to war.
See? If not for these,
you wouldn't be here.
I'm trying to... What do you call it?
That's an olive branch.
Is that what you call it?
Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
We're kinda...
- Well, not kinda...
- Pregnant?
No. Definitely not.
We're taking a break.
It's nobody's fault.
I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
A few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.
Then, we had to mop up HYDRA...
and then Ultron. My fault.
And then, and then, and then,
I never stopped.
Because the truth is I don't wanna stop.
I don't wanna lose her.
I thought maybe the Accords
could split the difference.
In her defence, I'm a handful.
Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass,
but he and Mom always made it work.
I'm glad Howard got married.
I only knew him
when he was young and single.
Oh, really? You two knew each other?
He never mentioned that.
Maybe only a thousand times.
God, I hated you.
I don't mean to make things difficult.
I know, because you're
a very polite person.
If I see a situation pointed south...
I can't ignore it.
Sometimes I wish I could.
No, you don't.
No, I don't.
Sometimes...
Sometimes I wanna
punch you in your perfect teeth.
But I don't wanna see you gone.
We need you, Cap.
So far, nothing's happened
that can't be undone, if you sign.
We can make the last 24 hours legit.
Barnes gets transferred to
an American psych-centre...
instead of a Wakandan prison.
I'm not saying it's impossible...
but there would have to be safeguards.
Sure.
Once we put out the PR fire,
those documents can be amended.
I'd file a motion to have
you and Wanda reinstated...
Wanda? What about Wanda?
She's fine. She's confined
to the compound, currently.
Vision's keeping her company.
Oh, God, Tony.
Every time I think you see
things the right way...
It's 100 acres with a lap pool.
It's got a screening room.
There's worse ways to protect people.
Protection?
Is that how you see this?
This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
- She's not a US citizen.
- Oh, come on, Tony.
And they don't grant visas
to weapons of mass destruction.
She's a kid!
Give me a break!
I'm doing what has to be done.
To stave off something worse.
You keep telling yourself that.
Hate to break up the set.
Hello, Mr Barnes.
I've been sent by
the United Nations to evaluate you.
Do you mind if I sit?
Your first name is James?
The receipt for your gear.
"Bird costume"? Come on.
I didn't write it.
I'm not here to judge you.
I just want to ask you a few questions.
Do you know where you are, James?
I can't help you if you
don't talk to me, James.
My name is Bucky.
Hello?
Hey!
Why would the Task Force
release this photo to begin with?
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?
Right. It's a good way
to flush a guy out of hiding.
Set off a bomb, get your picture taken.
Get seven billion people looking
for the Winter Soldier.
You're saying someone
framed him to find him?
Steve, we looked for the guy
for two years and found nothing.
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.
Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee
that whoever framed him would get him.
It guarantees that we would.
Yeah.
Tell me, Bucky.
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
I don't wanna talk about it.
You fear that if you open your mouth,
the horrors might never stop.
Don't worry.
We only have to talk about one.
Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes.
Friday, get me a source on that outage.
Sub-level five, East Wing.
What the hell is this?
Why don't we discuss your home?
Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no.
I mean your real home.

Mission report. December 16, 1991.
Help me.
Help.
Get up.
Who are you? What do you want?
To see an empire fall.
Hey.
Evac all civilians.
Get me a perimeter around the building,
and gunships in the air.
Please tell me you brought a suit.
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-piece, two-button.
I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
Follow me.
We're in position.
You could at least recognise me.
Damn it.
He asked me again
if you were going to be there.
I said I wasn't sure.
You should have seen his
little face. Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
James Barnes the suspect
in the UN Vienna bombing...
...escaped custody today.
...also missing Avenger
Captain Steve Rogers...
and Sam Wilson.
Hey, Cap!
Steve.
Which Bucky am I talking to?
Your mom's name was Sarah.
You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Can't read that in a museum.
Just like that, we're supposed to be cool?
What did I do?
Enough.
Oh, God, I knew this would happen.
Everything HYDRA
put inside me is still there.
All he had to do
was say the goddamn words.
- Who was he?
- I don't know.
People are dead. The bombing, the setup...
the doctor did all that just
to get 10 minutes with you.
I need you to do
better than "I don't know."
He wanted to know about Siberia.
Where I was kept.
He wanted to know exactly where.
Why would he need to know that?
Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
It hurts!
Good work.
Get me out of here.
Who were they?
Their most elite death squad.
More kills than anyone in HYDRA history.
And that was before the serum.
They all turn out like you?
Worse.
The doctor, could he control them?
Enough.
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
With these guys, he could do it.
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilise.
They can take a whole country down
in one night, you'd never see them coming.
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.
- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.
Even if he did...
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.
We're on our own.
Maybe not.
I know a guy.
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?
We will.
GSG 9's got the borders covered.
Recon's flying 24/7.
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.
It's clear you can't be objective.
I'm putting Special Ops on this.
What happens when the shooting starts?
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
If we're provoked.
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.
There are dead people
who would be alive now.
Feel free to check my math.
All due respect, you're not gonna
solve this with boys and bullets, Ross.
You gotta let us bring them in.
How would that end
any differently than last time?
Because this time, I won't be
wearing loafers and a silk shirt.
72 hours, guaranteed.
36 hours.
Barnes.
Rogers.
Wilson.
Thank you, sir.
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?
You all right?
Always.
36 hours. Jeez.
We're seriously understaffed.
Oh, yeah.
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
You really think he'd be on our side?
No.
I have an idea.
Me, too. Where's yours?
Downstairs.
Where's yours?
Hey, May.
Mmm. Hey.
How was school today?
It was okay.
This crazy car parked outside.
- Oh, Mr Parker.
- Um...
What are you doing...
Hey! Uh, I'm Peter.
Tony.
What are you doing here?
It's about time we met.
You've been getting my emails, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?
Regarding the...
You didn't even tell me about the grant.
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.
- Right.
- Yeah.
Remember when you applied?
Yeah.
I approved, so now we're in business.
But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?
You keeping secrets from me now?
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...
Anyway, what did I apply for?
That's what I'm here to hash out.
Okay. Hash it out, okay.
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.
Yeah, well, we come in
all shapes and sizes, you know?
This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah.
Is this grant got money
involved or whatever? No?
Yeah, it's pretty well funded.
Yeah? Wow.
Look who you're talking to.
- Can I have five minutes with him?
- Sure.
As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.
Whoa, what have we here? Retro tech, huh?
Thrift store? Salvation Army?
- Uh, the garbage, actually.
- You're a dumpster diver?
Yeah, I was...
Anyway, look, um, I definitely
did not apply for your grant...
- Ah-ah! Me first.
- Okay.
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.
That's you, right?
Um, no.
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.
Look at you go.
Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.
That's not easy. You got mad skills.
That's all on YouTube, though, right?
That's where you found that?
Because you know that's all fake.
It's all done on the computer.
Mmm-hmm.
It's like that video. What is it?
Yeah. Oh, you mean like
those UFOs over Phoenix?
Exactly.
Oh, what have we here?
Uh...
You're the Spider-ling.
Crime-fighting spider. You're Spider-Boy?
Spider-Man.
Not in that onesie, you're not.
It's not a onesie.
I don't believe this. I was actually
having a really good day today, Mr Stark.
Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there...
and Algebra test, nailed it.
Who else knows? Anybody?
Nobody.
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?
No. No.
No! If she knew, she would freak out.
And when she freaks out, I freak out.
You know what I think is really cool?
This webbing.
That tensile strength is off the charts.
Who manufactured that?
I did.
Climbing walls, how you doing that?
Adhesive gloves?
It's a long story. I was...
Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Yes, I can.
I'm blind!
I can see in those.
Okay?
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.
There's way too much input,
so they just kinda help me focus.
You're in dire need of an upgrade.
Systemic, top to bottom,
hundred-point restoration.
That's why I'm here.
Why you doing this?
I gotta know, what's your MO?
What gets you outta that
twin bed in the morning?
Because...
Because I've been me my whole life,
and I've had these powers for six months.
Mmm-hmm.
I read books, I build computers.
Yeah, I would love to play football,
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.
Sure, because you're different.
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...
and then the bad things happen...
they happen because of you.
So you wanna look out for the little guy,
you wanna do your part?
Make the world
a better place, all that, right?
Yeah, just looking out for the little guy.
That's what it is.
I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.
You got a passport?
No, I don't even have a driver's licence.
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.
Oh, you'll love it.
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?
I got homework.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.
Might be a little dangerous.
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.
Don't tell Aunt May.
All right, Spider-Man.
Get me out of this.
Sorry. I'll get the...
What is it?
Stay here, please.
Guess I shoulda knocked.
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?
Disappointing my kids.
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.
Cap needs our help. Come on.
Clint!
You should not be here.
Really?
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.
Please consider
the consequences of your actions.
Okay, they're considered.
Okay, we gotta go.
It's this way.
I've caused enough problems.
You gotta help me, Wanda.
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.
Shit.
I knew I should've stretched.
Clint, you can't overpower me.
I know I can't.
But she can.
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.
I'm leaving.
I can't let you.
I'm sorry.
If you do this...
they will never stop being afraid of you.
I can't control their fear, only my own.
Oh...
Come on. We got one more stop.
It's just a matter of time.
Our satellites are running
facial, biometric,
and behavioural pattern scans.
Move or you will be moved.
As entertaining as that would be...
You really think you can find him?
My resources are considerable.
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.
You know where they are.
I know someone who does.
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.
It's low profile.
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.
Can you move your seat up?
No.
I owe you again.
Keeping a list.
You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.
They're going to come looking for you.
I know.
Thank you, Sharon.
That was...
Late.
Damn right.
I should go.
Okay.
Cap.
You know I wouldn't have called
if I had any other choice.
Hey, man, you're doing me a favour.
Besides, I owe a debt.
Thanks for having my back.
It was time to get off my ass.
How about our other recruit?
He's rarin' to go.
Had to put a little coffee in him...
but he should be good.
What time zone is this?
Come on. Come on.
- Captain America!
- Mr Lang.
It's an honour.
I'm shaking your hand too long.
Wow! This is awesome!
Captain America.
I know you, too. You're great!
Jeez.
Ah, look, I wanna say, I know
you know a lot of super people, so...
thinks for thanking of me.
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?
Uh, good to see you.
Look, what happened last time when I...
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.
They tell you what we're up against?
Something about some psycho-assassins?
We're outside the law on this one.
So if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.
Yeah, well, what else is new?
We should get moving.
We got a chopper lined up.
They're evacuating the airport.
Stark.
Stark?
Suit up.
Wow, it's so weird how you run
into people at the airport.
- Don't you think that's weird?
- Definitely weird.
Hear me out, Tony.
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.
Captain.
Your Highness.
Anyway...
Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in.
That was 24 hours ago.
Can you help a brother out?
You're after the wrong guy.
Your judgement is askew.
Your old war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.
And there are five more
super soldiers just like him.
I can't let the doctor
find them first, Tony. I can't.
Steve...
you know what's about to happen.
Do you really wanna
punch your way out of this one?
All right, I've run out of patience.
Underoos!
- Nice job, kid.
- Thanks.
I could have stuck the landing
a little better, it's just...
New suit. It's nothing, Mr Stark.
It's perfect. Thank you.
Yeah, we don't really need
to start a conversation.
Okay. Cap. Captain.
Big fan. I'm Spider-Man.
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.
- Hey, everyone.
- Good job.
You've been busy.
And you've been a complete idiot.
Dragging in Clint...
"Rescuing" Wanda from a place she doesn't
even want to leave, a safe place.
I'm trying to keep...
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.
You did that when you signed.
All right, we're done.
You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna
come with us, now, because it's us...
or a squad of J-SOC guys...
with no compunction about being impolite.
Come on.
We found it.
Their Quinjet's in
hangar five, north runway.
All right, Lang.
Hey, guys, something...
Whoa. What the hell was that?
I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Oh, great.
All right, there's two
on the parking deck.
One of them's Maximoff,
I'm gonna grab her.
Rhodey, you wanna take Cap?
Got two in the terminal,
Wilson and Barnes.
Barnes is mine.
Hey, Mr Stark, what should I do?
What we discussed.
Keep your distance, web them up.
Okay, copy that.
Move, Captain.
I won't ask a second time.
Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
I wouldn't stress about it.
What the hell is that?
Everyone's got a gimmick now.
You have a metal arm?
That is awesome, dude.
You have the right to remain silent!
Sorry, Cap, this won't kill you...
but it ain't gonna tickle either.
Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
You locked me in my room.
Okay, first, that's an exaggeration.
Second, I did it to protect you.
- Hey, Clint.
- Hey, man.
Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you.
You got tired of shooting golf?
Well, I played 18, shot 18.
Just can't seem to miss.
First time for everything.
Made you look.
Multiple contusions detected.
Yeah, I detected that, too.
Oh, God!
Hey, buddy, I think you lost this!
Ahh!
Those wings carbon fibre?
Is this stuff coming out of you?
That would explain
the rigidity-flexibility ratio,
which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
I don't know if you've
been in a fight before...
but there's usually not this much talking.
All right, sorry. My bad.
Guys, look, I'd love to keep this up,
but I've only got one job here today...
and I gotta impress Mr Stark,
so, I'm really sorry.
You couldn't have done that earlier?
I hate you.
Great.
Hey, Cap, heads-up!
Throw it at this.
Now!
Oh, come on!
Oh, man, I thought it was a water truck.
Uh, sorry.
All right, now I'm pissed.
Is this part of the plan?
Well, my plan was go easy on them.
You wanna switch it up?
There's our ride.
Come on!
Captain Rogers...
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.
But for the collective good...
you must surrender now.
What do we do, Cap?
We fight.
This is gonna end well.
They're not stopping.
Neither are we.
We're still friends, right?
Depends on how hard you hit me.
You were pulling your punches.
I didn't kill your father.
Then why did you run?
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.
Look, kid, there's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.
Mr Stark said you'd say that. Wow.
He also said to go for your legs.
Ahh!
Clint, can you get him off me?
Buckled in?
Yeah. No, I'm good.
I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go!
Stark tell you anything else?
That you're wrong. You think you're right.
That makes you dangerous.
Guess he had a point.
You got heart, kid. Where you from?
Queens.
Brooklyn.
Friday?
We have some weapon systems offline.
What?
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.
Who's speaking?
It's your conscience.
We don't talk a lot these days.
Friday?
Deploying fire suppression system.
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy!
Whoa!
We gotta go.
That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
We gotta draw out the flyers.
I'll take Vision, you get to the jet.
No, you get to the jet!
Both of you!
The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
As much as I hate to admit it...
if we're gonna win this one,
some of us might have to lose it.
This isn't the real fight, Steve.
All right, Sam. What's the play?
We need a diversion. Something big.
I got something kinda big.
But I can't hold it very long.
On my signal, run like hell.
And if I tear myself in half...
don't come back for me.
He's gonna tear himself in half?
You sure about this, Scott?
I do it all the time.
I mean, once. In a lab.
Then I passed out.
I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss.
Holy shit!
Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
I guess that's the signal.
Way to go, Tic Tac!
Give me back my Rhodey.
I got him.
Okay, anybody on our side
hiding any shocking
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose...
I'm open to suggestions.
You wanna get to them...
you gotta go through me.
Uh-huh.
We haven't met yet.
- I'm Clint.
- I don't care.
Whoa!
Ahhh!
Get off!
Something just flew in me!
You're not gonna stop.
You know I can't.
I'm gonna regret this.
Go.
Hey, guys, you ever see
that really old movie,
Empire Strikes Back?
Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him.
He's on the young side.
You know that part
where they're on the snow planet...
with the walking thingies?
Maybe the kid's onto something.
High now, Tony. Go high.
Yes!
That was awesome!
Does anyone have any orange slices?
Kid, you all right?
Whoa!
Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.
- That was scary.
- Yeah.
You're done, all right?
What? I'm good, I'm fine.
You did a good job. Stay down.
No, it's good. I gotta get him back.
You're going home or I'll call Aunt May!
- Dude.
- You're done!
Wait.
Mr Stark, wait. I'm not done. I'm not...
Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
I said I'd help you find him,
not catch him.
There's a difference.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
It's as I said.
Catastrophe.
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.
Vision! You copy?
Target his thruster,
turn him into a glider.
Rhodey!
Tony, I'm flying dead stick.
Rhodes!
Read vitals.
Heartbeat detected.
Emergency medical is on its way.
I'm sorry.
- this is room 201...
Bacon and black coffee again today?
You know me so well...
Hello? Your breakfast is here.
May I let myself in?
What's gonna happen to your friends?
Whatever it is...
I'll deal with it.
I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
What you did all those years...
It wasn't you.
You didn't have a choice.
I know.
But I did it.
How did this happen?
I became distracted.
I didn't think that was possible.
Neither did I.
The doctors say he shattered
L4 through S1.
Extreme laceration to the spinal cord.
Probably looking at
some form of paralysis.
Steve's not gonna stop.
If you don't either, Rhodey's
gonna be the best case scenario.
You let them go, Nat.
We played this wrong.
"We"?
Boy, it must be hard to shake
the whole double agent thing, huh?
It sticks in the DNA.
Are you incapable
of letting go of your ego...
for one goddamn second?
T'Challa told Ross what you did, so...
they're coming for you.
I'm not the one that needs
to watch their back.
What am I looking at, Friday?
Priority upload from Berlin police.
Fire up the chopper.
The Task Force called for a psychiatrist
as soon as Barnes was captured.
The UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard
from Geneva within the hour.
He was met by this man.
Did you run facial recognition yet?
What do I look like?
Uh, I don't know.
I've been picturing a redhead.
You must be thinking of someone else.
Must be.
The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.
Sokovian Intelligence.
Zemo ran Echo Scorpion...
a Sokovian covert kill squad.
What happened to the real Broussard?
He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room.
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis...
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Son of a bitch.
- Get this to Ross.
- Yes, boss.
This is Raft Prison Control.
You're cleared for landing, Mr Stark.
So? You got the files?
Let's reroute the satellites,
start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
You seriously think I'm gonna listen
to you after that fiasco in Leipzig?
You're lucky you're not
in one of these cells.
The Futurist, gentlemen!
The Futurist is here!
He sees all!
He knows what's best for you,
whether you like it or not.
Give me a break, Barton.
I had no idea
they'd put you here. Come on.
Yeah, well, you knew
they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
Yeah, but not some
super-max floating ocean pokey.
This place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...
Criminals?
Criminals, Tony.
Think that's the word you're looking for.
Right?
That didn't used to mean me.
Or Sam, or Wanda.
But here we are.
- Because you broke the law.
- Yeah.
I didn't make you.
- La, la, la, la, la...
- You read it, you broke it.
You're all grown up,
you got a wife and kids.
I don't understand, why didn't you
think about them before
you chose the wrong side?
You gotta watch your back with this guy.
There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Hank Pym always said
you never can trust a Stark.
Who are you?
Come on, man.
How's Rhodes?
They're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow...
so fingers crossed.
What do you need? They feed you yet?
You're the good cop, now?
I'm just the guy who needs
to know where Steve went.
Well, you better go get a bad cop...
because you're gonna have to
go Mark Fuhrman on my ass...
to get information out of me.
Well, I just knocked
the A out of their AV.
We got about 30 seconds before
they realise it's not their equipment.
What'd you do?
Get it back up!
Just look.
Because that...
is the fellow who was
supposed to interrogate Barnes.
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.
That's a first.
Cap is definitely off the reservation...
but he's about to need
all the help he can get.
We don't know each other very well.
You don't have to...
Hey, it's all right.
Look, I'll tell you...
but you have to go alone and as a friend.
Easy.
Stark?
Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Nope. Told me to go to hell.
I'm going back to the compound instead,
but you can call me anytime.
I'll put you on hold.
I like to watch the line blink.
You remember that time we had to ride back
from Rockaway Beach
in the back of that freezer truck?
Was that the time we used our train money
to buy hot dogs?
You blew three bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.
What was her name, again?
Dolores. You called her Dot.
She's gotta be
a hundred years old right now.
So are we, pal.
He can't have been here
more than a few hours.
Long enough to wake them up.
You ready?
Yeah.
You seem a little defensive.
It's been a long day.
At ease, Soldier.
I'm not currently after you.
Then why are you here?
Could be your story's not so crazy.
Maybe.
Ross has no idea I'm here.
I'd like to keep it that way.
Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.
It's good to see you, Tony.
You too, Cap.
Hey, Manchurian Candidate,
you're killing me.
There's a truce here. You can drop...
I got heat signatures.
How many?
Uh, one.
If it's any comfort,
they died in their sleep.
Did you really think I wanted more of you?
What the hell?
I'm grateful to them, though.
They brought you here.
Please, Captain.
The Soviets built
this chamber to withstand
the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
I'm betting I could beat that.
Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr Stark.
Given time.
But then you'd never know why you came.
You killed innocent people in Vienna
just to bring us here?
I've thought about
nothing else for over a year.
I studied you.
I followed you.
But now that you're standing here...
I just realised...
there's a bit of green
in the blue of your eyes.
How nice to find a flaw.
You're Sokovian.
Is that what this is about?
Sokovia was a failed state
long before you blew it to hell.
No.
I'm here because I made a promise.
You lost someone?
I lost everyone.
And so will you.
An empire toppled
by its enemies can rise again.
But one which crumbles from within?
That's dead.
Forever.
I know that road.
What is this?
Help my wife.
Please. Help.
Sergeant Barnes?
Howard!
Howard!
No, Tony.
Did you know?
I didn't know it was him.
Don't bullshit me, Rogers. Did you know?
Yes.
Get out of here!
It wasn't him, Tony.
HYDRA had control of his mind!
Move!
It wasn't him!
Left bootjet failing.
Flight systems compromised.
Ah, crap.
He's not gonna stop. Go.
Come on, come on.
Targeting system's knackered, boss.
I'm eyeballing it.
Do you even remember them?
I remember all of them.
This isn't gonna change what happened.
I don't care.
He killed my mom.
You should have seen his little face.
Just try, okay?
I'm going to bed.
I love you.
I almost killed the wrong man.
Hardly an innocent one.
This is all you wanted?
To see them rip each other apart.
My father lived outside the city.
I thought we would be safe there.
My son was excited.
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.
I told my wife, "Don't worry.
"They're fighting in the city.
We're miles from harm."
When the dust cleared...
and the screaming stopped...
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.
My father...
still holding my wife and son in his arms.
And the Avengers?
They went home.
I knew I couldn't kill them.
More powerful men than me have tried.
But, if I could get them
to kill each other...
I'm sorry about your father.
He seemed a good man.
With a dutiful son.
Vengeance has consumed you.
It's consuming them.
I am done letting it consume me.
Justice will come soon enough.
Tell that to the dead.
The living are not done with you, yet.
You can't beat him hand-to-hand.
Analyse his fight pattern.
Scanning.
Countermeasures ready.
Let's kick his ass.
He's my friend.
So was I.
Stay down. Final warning.
I could do this all day.
That shield doesn't belong to you.
You don't deserve it.
My father made that shield!
Meals at 8 and 5.
Toilet privileges twice a day.
Raise your voice, zap.
Touch the glass, zap.
You step out of line, you deal with me.
Please, step out of line, hmm?
So how does it feel?
To spend all that time, all that effort...
to see it fail so spectacularly?
Did it?
- It's just the first pass.
- Yeah.
Give me some feedback,
anything you think of.
Shock absorption, lateral movement.
Cup holder?
You may wanna think about
some AC down in...
Ow.
Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
No. Don't help me.
Ah.
138 combat missions.
That's how many I've flown, Tony.
Every one of them
could've been my last, but I flew them.
Because the fight needed to be fought.
It's the same with these Accords.
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.
And yeah, this sucks. This is, uh...
This is a bad beat.
But it hasn't changed my mind.
I don't think.
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.
Are you Tony Stank?
Yes, this is Tony Stank.
You're in the right place.
Thank you for that!
Never dropping that, by the way.
"Table for one, Mr Stank.
"Please, by the bathroom."
Tony...
I'm glad you're back at the compound.
I don't like the idea of you
rattling around a mansion by yourself.
We all need family.
The Avengers are yours.
Maybe more so than mine.
I've been on my own since I was 18.
I never really fit in anywhere,
even in the Army.
My faith's in people, I guess.
Individuals.
And I'm happy to say that,
for the most part...
they haven't let me down.
Which is why I can't let them down either.
Locks can be replaced,
but maybe they shouldn't.
I know I hurt you, Tony.
I guess I thought by not telling you
about your parents...
I was sparing you...
but I can see now that
I was really sparing myself.
And I'm sorry.
Hopefully one day you can understand.
I wish we agreed on the Accords.
I really do.
I know you're doing what you believe in,
and that's all any of us can do.
That's all any of us should.
Priority call from Secretary Ross.
There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Yeah, put him through.
Tony, we have a problem.
- Uh, please hold.
- No, don't.
So no matter what...
I promise you...
if you need us...
if you need me...
I'll be there.
You sure about this?
I can't trust my own mind.
So, until they figure out
how to get this stuff out of my head...
I think going back under
is the best thing.
For everybody.
Thank you for this.
Your friend and my father...
they were both victims.
If I can help one of them find peace...
You know, if they find out he's here...
they'll come for him.
Let them try.
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
And flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
I tackle, we tussle
Oh, my days, we're rolling
My right hand's gripped on his
Colt Single Action Army
Oh, no
Well, your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun
Oh, no
N-E-O, O-M-G
Gee whiz
Girl, you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
Oh, my days
He disagrees
Oh, no
Speak easy
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Oh, no
Hey, shady baby
I'm hot like the prodigal son
Pick a petal
Eenie, meenie, miney, moe
And flower
You're the chosen one
Well, your left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Well, my left hand's free
Oh
Oh, no
Who was it? Who hit you?
Some guy.
So itchy, man, God.
What's "some guy's" name?
Uh, Steve.
Steve? From 12-C?
- With the overbite?
- No, no, no.
You don't know him. He's from Brooklyn.
Ouch.
Well...
I hope you got a few good licks in.
Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually.
His friend was huge. Like huge.
That's way better. Thank you.
Okay, tough guy.
Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door?

I'm kinda lonesome back here.
- Little help...
- Just... I have to keep my hands on the wheel.
Excuse me!
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?
Not the daffodil daydream. The girl.
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife. But...
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's
a reason I'm in this cab today.
- Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?
- No, my slender, brown friend. Love...
... is a beautiful thing. When you find it,
the whole world tastes like daffodil daydream.
So you gotta hold on to love. Tight!
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.
Sir, what does Ms Mama June taste like?
Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is it's bad.
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?
Oh, that's because it's Christmas day, Dopinder,
and I'm after someone on my naughty list.
I've been waiting, 1 year, 3 weeks, 6 days and---
14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.
- And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?
- This shit.
Boo!
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.
You're not the only
one with a war to win.
That won't do.
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.
We'd appreciate your patience.
Okay...
We'll deliver in full
the following month.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Fucking mutant!
Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!
That's $27.50.
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.
Merry Christmas!
And a convivial Tuesday
and April to you, Pool!
Oh! Oh, hello!
I know, right? Whose balls did I
have to fondle to get my very own movie?
I can't tell you, but it does rhyme
with "Pulverine". And lemme tell you...
He's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under!
Anyway. I got places to be.
A face to fix. And, oh!
Bad guys to kill.
Maximum effort.
Cock shot!
Rich! Corinthian leather!
I'm looking for Francis!
Have you seen this man?
Yanking, yanking!
I've never said this, but don't swallow.
Shit. Did I leave the stove on?
Now, breaking news.
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
Residents are advised to remain in their homes.
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...
Red suit. Deadpool.
Negasonic! Come. We have mission.
Colossus, wait up.
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?
Which benefits, the matching unitards?
The house that blows up every few years?
Please. House blowing up builds character.
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.
Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.
Deadpool may try to break yours.
Hey!
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!
Let's count 'em down!
Shit, motherfucker!
Ten! Shit.
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!
Bad Deadpool.
Seven. Good Deadpool!
Someone's not counting.
Six!
Four...
Gotcha!
Right up main street!
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.
I'm touching myself tonight.
Francis! Francis!
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?
You're not Francis!
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend said this was a
superhero movie but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kebab!"
Well, I may be super. But I'm no hero.
Anyhow, technically, this is a murder. But some
of the best love stories start with a murder.
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?
- Are you Mr. Merchant?
- The Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!
- Who placed the call?
- I did!
Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty!
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.
That is a no go on the tip-aroo, Jer.
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.
- I dodged a big-time bullet on that one!
- Not, out of the woods yet.
You need to seriously ease up on the
bedazzling. They're jeans, not a chandelier.
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.
- Just look, man, can I have my---
- I will shoot your fucking cat.
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?
Anywho...
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.
And little Megan, she's not made of
money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.
- I'm.....
- A stalker.
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?
Totally done. You should've seen your face!
- I didn't know what to do, I was so scared...
- Soft spot, remember?
Even look in her general direction again and you will learn
in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots, too.
That came out wrong.
Or did it?
Megan.
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.
No friggin' way.
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.
Hey, wait.
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.
Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies
except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.
You'd best hope we never
see your name on a gold card.
(Buck! Liefeld.)
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...
- Hey, I ain't taking any babysitting money,
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?
- You sure?
- Hmm.
For a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded.
Bet you let the kid off easy, too.
He's not a bad kid. Just a little light stalking. I was way
worse when I was his age, travelling to exotic places...
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,
meeting new and exciting people. And then..
Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your instagram.
So what were special forces doing in Jacksonville?
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.
I give you, a blowjob. I'm---
- Why do you make me make that?
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.
- Remind me what good will come of this?
- I don't take the shits, I just disturb them.
What you want?
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.
That's a new stool.
Stay the fuck down.
Alright, move, move, move, move.
Buck, go rest.
He's still breathing.
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.
You bet on me to die. Wow. Motherfucker,
you're the world's worst friend.
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.
And then die. At the city of Detroit.
Sorry. I wanted to win money.
I never win anything.
- Whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drink's on me!
- Yeah!
Domestic! Nothing imported.
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?
Tight.
- Vanessa.
- Wade.
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?
I'd hit that.
Buck, you'd best apologize
before--- yeah. That.
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.
- Breathe through the nose.
- I don't have a filter between my brain and my...
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!
- Get outta here. Go cast a spell.
- Hey, hands off the merchandise.
Merchandise, huh. So you...
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.
- Rough childhood?
- Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.
Daddy left before I was conceived.
- Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
- Where else do you put one out?
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.
- Uncles. They took turns.
- I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole
of a locked closet which also happens to be my...
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.
You had a dishwasher. I didn't even know sleep. It was
pretty much 24/7 ball kegs, brownie mix and clown porn.
Who would do such a thing?
Hopefully, you. Later tonight?
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.
And a low-fat dessert.
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?
It's time to put
balls in holes.
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.
- You love ski ball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
- That's a tough call.
I just wanna get to know the real you. Not the short-
shorted 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.
Balls in holes.
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.
Okay. Here you go.
I had this sucker for a while.
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.
You are now the proud protector of the planet Arus.
And you, can erase stuff. Written in pencil.
- Milady.
- I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.
How many more minutes
could I get for this?
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.
- 5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.
- Deal. What do we do with the remaining 2:37?
Cuddle?
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?
Happy Valentines' Day.
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.
Happy Lenten.
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!
Happy Thanksgiving.
I love you.
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...
Can I visit you
between the holidays?
That sweater is terrible!
But red looks good on you.
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?
Your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?
- You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.
- Right.
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.
Will you...
- Stick it up my---
- ...Marry me?
Uh... Jinx?
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.
- They said 1-month salary, so ...
- You mean...
- I do.
- That's my line.
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!
I feel just like a little girl!
- What if I just held on and never let go?
- Just ride the bitch's back like Yoda on Luke.
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!
Perfect.
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.
Here's the thing:
Life is an endless series of train wrecks with
only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness.
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.
There are certainly options we can look into.
New drugs are being developed every day.
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer and
there were all these experimental drugs from Germany...
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.
Me? I'm memorizing the details of her
face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?
Take your time to process this. It's
important not to do anything rash.
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?
"A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W.
Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."
"His form looks good."
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.
Ringing any bells? No?
How 'bout now?
Wade fucking Wilson.
- Well, hello, gorgeous.
- Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar Pei.
And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time
to undo what you did to this butter face.
You should thank me. Apparently, I've made
you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.
Dad?
I think we can all agree that shit just went
sideways in the most colossal way.
Well, maybe not the most.
Now this, is my most prized possession.
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.
Sounds like you have. Bernadette is not going
anywhere, because you're not going anywhere.
- Drink.
- You're right.
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.
You belong here at home. Surrounded by
your Voltron, and your Bernadette and your me.
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.
Not a good one, like Slapchop,
more Shakeweighty.
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.
We will make you better than better.
- A superhero.
- Look, Agent Smith, I tried the
hero business and it left a mark.
But if I ever hit fuck
-it, I'll look you up.
Oh. Shit.
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...
His drink's on him.
What'd he say?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.
They made 3 of those movies.
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.
But what it does to
the people you love.
Who knew if this guy could save my life? But I
knew there's only one way that I could save hers.
Isn't that what superheroes do?
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.
Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass, local dry
cleaning discounts, lucrative film deals,
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.
Con: they're all lame-ass teacher's pets!
- You know I can hear you.
- Wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them.
Stay right here. You've been
warned before, Deadpool.
This is a shameful and reckless use of your
powers. You will both be coming with us.
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the goody
two-shoes bullshit right now. And you are?
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
Negasonic Teenage---
What the shit?!
That's the coolest name ever!
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.
- Let me guess, X-Men left you behind
on what, shit detail?
- What does that make you?
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"
"I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen
silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences."
So what's it gonna be? Long, sullen
silence? Or mean comment? Go on.
- You got me in a box here.
- We can't allow this, Deadpool. Please, come quietly.
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.
That guy was already
up there when I got here.
- Wade, you are better than this. Join us,
use your powers for good.
- Heads up!
- Be a superhero.
- Listen! The day I decide to be a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,
who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland
Mansion of some creepy, old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker,
on that day, I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend
request. But until then, I'mma do what I came here to do.
- Either that, or slap the bitch out of you!
- Wade...
- Hey. Hey, Douchepool!
- Zip it, Sinead!
And I hope you're watching...
Quite unfortunate.
That does it!
Canada!
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.
Oh, your poor wife!
You really should stop.
All the dinosaurs fear the T-Rex.
- I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
- This is embarassing.
Please. Stay down.
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?
- Do you have 'off' switch?
- Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the 'on' switch?
Enough!
Let us go talk to the Professor.
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!
Oh my God. Nasty.
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
Rock, meet bottom.
When life ends up breathtakingly fucked, you can
generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.
This, well, this was mine.
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.
You've finally hit fuck-it.
- Just promise you'll do right by me.
So I can do right by someone else.
- Of course.
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.
And Jesus! A warmer table.
You should really come up with a safe
word, fellas. I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.
Easy!
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?
I'm calling Wang.
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?
- Patience, Angel. All in good time.
- Are you here for the turn down service or what?
- We have another talker.
- I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.
Shut the fuck up.
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."
But I'm going blunt. This workshop
is not a government-led program.
It's a private institution that turns reclamation
projects like yourself into men of....
Extraordinary abilities.
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly... Wrong.
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates
any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, I hope.
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, also scorched
my nerve endings so I no longer feel pain.
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.
Thank-- thank you! You
have something in your teeth.
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.
It's been bothering
me for a long time.
Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name,
because it sounds suspiciously made up.
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Faulty?
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is your sense of humor.
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.
- He's all yours.
- C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?
This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum, so we're gonna have to make you suffer.
If you're lucky, your mutant genes will
activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion.
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.
Until you finally mutate...
... or die.
- You mean like a bucket list?
- Like a fuck it list, I'd like to light a
spiff off the Olympic torch.
Acid to me, right after.
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...
Vanessa...
I wanna see Vanessa.
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.
- We're just joking.
- No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions.
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.
F-R-A-N-C-I--- oops!
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.
Why don't you do us all a favor and shut
the fuck up? Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
See, here's the problem with round-the-clock
torture, it's that you can't really step it up from there.
Is that what you think?
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.
What we're gonna do is lower the oxygen concentration in
the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
If your brain wave's slowing and you're about
to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2.
If your heart rate slows meaning you're able
to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down.
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?
You still think we're
making you a superhero.
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.
And that's what they'll have you doing. Terrorizing
citizens, putting down freedom fighters.
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.
Wait, wait, wait...
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.
- What have you done to me?
- I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
Striking your cancer as fast as it can form.
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.
But where's the fun in that?
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.
Not because I need to.
Because I want to.
Farewell. Go ahead.
You already smell like shit.
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...
I think we have earned that one.
You take off. Go on, off you go.
Quick question:
What's my name?
Didn't think so.
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!
What's my name?
Wade...
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.
- She doesn't care what you--- Oh!
- Do you like what you see?
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.
Not gently. He was hate-fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship and that was their only catharsis without violence.
And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the British
shitstick who ran the mutant factory. And he's gone--- Poof!
You gotta do something to remedy this. 'Cause
as of now, you only have one course of action:
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror fims.
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.
Here's what I'm actually gonna do:
I'm gonna work thru his crew until somebody gives up Francis,
force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,
- the douchebag does think you're dead, right?
- Yeah.
- That's good. You should keep it that way.
- What, like, wear a mask?
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.
- That'll do.
- What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...
- ... or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie. Oh, shit.
- What?
- I put all my money on you, and now I
just realized I'm never gonna win the....
- Deadpool...
Captain Deadpool.
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.
To you, Mr. Pool. Deadpool. That
sounds like a fuckin' franchise.
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it!
Where's Francis?
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!
Don't make me ask twice.
Where is Francis?
He made me ask twice.
Is the mask muffling my voice?
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!
- No, please...
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
Little spider-monkey!
This is confusing! Is it sexist to hit you, is it
more sexist to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!
Donde esta Francesca?
Tell me where your fucking boss is!
Or you're gonna die! In 5 minutes!
Nice to see you, Jared. I'll
take a foot long. Fully loaded.
- 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89, about to be 90.
- Mr. Wilson?
- You're looking very alive.
- Hah! Only on the outside.
- This is not going to end---
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.
- Where's your boss?
- I can tell you exactly where---
You'll tell me. But first, you might wanna look
away for this. Now this little piggy went to...
Thank you, Agent Smith.
Taxi!
Hop in! Great day for a ride.
And we all know
how this turned out.
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.
There. All caught up.
Sorry! About bleeding
at all your garbage.
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.
Like the kind where your year-long plan
ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.
Morning, sleepyhead.
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.
- Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.
- You mean my big, rubber, masturbating shoes?
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?
Bactine should do it.
How's that () coming along? Ikea
doesn't assemble itself, you know.
You're telling me. I don't mind the ().
It's an improvement on the ().
Anything's an improvement over the ().
I'd taken an () or a () over the ().
No, I didn't get
excited 'till I saw ().
- Screw, please.
- Here? Now? Just kidding. I know it's been decades.
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.
Ta------da...
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.
And I quote, "Looking for roommate, blind, and likes imperfections. Must be good with hands." Or would you rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?
- Why such a douche this morning?
- Let's recap:
The cock-fizzle that turned me into this
freak slipped through my arms today.
Arm.
Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super
-sexy ex back and prevent this from happening to someone else.
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.
#drive-by.
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.
I only wish I'd heal the same.
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.
- Right. And when he heals?
- He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.
- Tylenol PM?
- It sticks back where you stuck the Bactine.
I raided my stash of wisdom just to take a sec
and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.
But I appreciate the gesture.
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?
About the size of a KFC spork.
I get why you're so pissy, but your mood's never gonna
brighten 'till you find this woman and tell her how you feel.
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. McGoo? She wouldn't
have me. If you could see me, you'd understand.
- Looks aren't everything.
- Looks are everything! Ever heard David Beckham speak?
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium. You think
Ryan Reynolds got this far on a superior acting method?
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...
You're blind.
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this arm plows through puberty
and then I'll come up with a whole, new Christmas day plan.
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.
Go, go, go, go, go...
So the doctor says, the bad news is you don't have
that long to live. So the patient says, how long do I have?
The doctor says, five.
The guys says, five what?
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...
Can I help you ladies?
Oh, I do hope so.
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.
Name of Wade Wilson.
Sorry, I don't know the name.
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.
- I've seen this girl.
- This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around. This
isn't really the place to do something like that.
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?
There's a midnight showing of Blade II.
Thanks for having my back, guys.
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, and by we, I mean you.
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?
"Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!
- Or as I like to call her, Irony.
- I gotta find her fast, before numb nuts does.
- How do you know she's in here?
- Some customer stalking that fox.
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.
Especially from this angle.
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.
You weak motherfucker!
C'mon. Get it together, this isn't
about you, this is about Vanessa.
Here we go.
Maximum effort.
Vanessa!
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about... an old boyfriend?
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.
Like a jigsaw puzzle.
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
- Hey, where did she go?
- I saw her head to the back. Go get her, tiger.
Motherfucker!
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate---
- Jiminy---- Fuck! Fuck!
- We can talk... or you can hit that...
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking-- find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd with the smiling face and
the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the () but this is holding my interest.
- I told you, we're going with the (), not the (),
get it thru your head or get outta Fucktown!
- Shit.
- That's all the pieces in the house.
- No, no, no, come on. Let's go. Cough it up.
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.
25 cal. I like it.
Wade...
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.
Oh, listen, Al...
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere
in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness.
Good luck.
You wanna get fucked up?
Put her down over here.
Go on, then.
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.
I've been trying to tell you assholes you
got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.
- Fake laugh! Hiding real pain! Go get Silver balls.
- You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you. It s almost
like, the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.
My chrome-penised friend back there, has agreed to do me this
solid. In exchange, I said I would consider joining his boy band.
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.
- So, any luck winning Gita back?
- I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool, but Bandu
is more craftier and handsomer than me.
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.
He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, DP, I plan to gut
him like a tandoori fish then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)
He's super dead.
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.
Not often a dude ruins your face, skullstomps your sanity, grabs your baby mama and personally sees thru 4 of your 5 shittiest moments.
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.
Hey, where's your duffel bag?
Goddammit! We'll do this the old-
fashioned way. With two swords..
... and maximum effort.
Cue the music.
Wade Wilson!
- What's my name?
- Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for 'ya.
- Go get some.
- Superhero landing. She's gonna
do a superhero landing, wait for it!
Superhero landing! You know, that's really hard
on your knees. Totally impractical, they all do it.
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please----
I mean, that's why I brought her?
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.
Go get her, tiger.
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.
Alright then. Fire!
Finish fucking her the fuck off!
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!
Look away, child. Look away!
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.
So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle, possibly...
... even lover-like treatment.
Fine! Commando!
Teabag!
- Bob?
- Wade?
- Oh my God, I haven't seen you since, TGIFridays!
- Jacksonville. Fridays.
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is she still
fixing that tuna casserole? It's so good, but bad for...
- Your... on the left... You are beautiful...
- That is so sweet! Thanks!
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.
Fire!
Hey! Climb on.
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.
- You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.
- Wade?
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.
- What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.
- Oh, you never left.
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.
Well I hope they've blocked pain to your
every last nerve. 'Cause I'mma go looking!
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.
When I'm finished, what's left to grow back you?
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.
- Fine. Fists.
- Sounds like your last Saturday night.
Asshole!
- Hang in there, baby. I got you.
- Wade!
I got a plan. You're
not gonna like it.
Shit, shit, shit!
Don't worry! I'm
totally on top of this.
Dammit! Maximum effort!
Thanks.
Just take it slow.
Oh, my God! That was so awe---
- Me and you, are headed
to fix this butter face!
- What?
You sure are a fucking idiot.
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?
- What?
- You heard me.
No, no!
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?
Any last words?
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!
Wade!
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?
- Four or five moments, that's all it takes.
- To...?
Be a hero.
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero.
Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true.
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.
Moments when you're offered a choice.
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...
... spare an enemy.
In these moments, everything else falls away.
The way the world sees us.
The way we---
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.
I can't even tell you... I deserve that...
that too.. No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.
Start talking!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,
- I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner...
It's been a rough couple of years.
- Rough?
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...
Every night we spoon for warmth, everybody
fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.
So you live in a house?
I should've come
and found you sooner.
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.
You made this mask?
And this one. In case
the other fell off.
Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Hey...
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..
It's a face...
I'd be happy to sit on.
But I'm not the same underneath
this suit either. Super-penis.
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.
What are you still doing ---- Get
outta here, go make yourself useful.
You, go be a really big brother to someone.
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.
And you, chicken noodle. Nothing
Compares 2 U. Sinead O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.
- That's all right. You're cool.
- What in the ass?
- That was not mean! I'm proud of you!
- We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.
You know, for a second there, it felt like we were 3 mini
lion robots coming together to form one super robot.
- This was stupid.
- Yeah.
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.
Come here.
WHAM! As promised.
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, here we go...
Looks nice, not gonna be the only thing that's pulling out tonight.
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh? Until next
time, this is your friendly neighborhood Pool guy singing...
You're still here.
It's over! Go home!
Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.
What were you expecting, Sam Jackson'll
show up? Eye patch? Saucy leather? Go, go.
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.
In the sequel, we're gonna have Cable. Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time-travel. We have no idea who to cast yet,
but it could be anybody. Just
take a big guy with a flat top.
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley.
She's got range, who knows? Anyway, big secret.
And don't leave your garbage rotting
around. It's a total dick move. Go.

I thought your thing was a sword?
We've been hired to stop
an interdimensional beast...
from feeding on those batteries,
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?
It's just, swords were your thing
and guns were mine.
But I guess we're both doing guns now.
I just didn't know that.
Drax, why aren't you wearing
one of Rocket's aero-rigs?
It hurts.
It hurts?
I have sensitive nipples.
(ROCKET LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"
What about him? What's he doing?
I'm finishing this so we can listen
to tunes while we work.
How is that a priority?
Blame Quill. He's the one
who loves music so much.
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.
That's hardly important right now.
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.
No, seriously, I side with Drax.
No, I understand that.
You're being very serious right now.
I can clearly see you winking.
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

He said the skin is too thick

Skin is the same level of thickness

I realize that.

What?
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)
What are they called again?
Anulax batteries.
Harbulary batteries.
That's nothing like what I just said.
But they're worth
thousands of units apiece...
which is why the Sovereign
hired us to protect them.
Careful what you say around these folks.
They're easily offended.
The cost of transgression is death.
AYESHA: We thank you, Guardians,
for putting your lives on the line.
We could not risk the lives
of our own Sovereign citizens.
Every citizen is born
exactly as designed by the community.
Impeccable,
both physically and mentally.
We control the DNA of our progeny...
germinating them in birthing pods.
I guess I prefer to make people
the old-fashioned way.
Perhaps someday,
you could give me a history lesson...
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.
For academic purposes.
I would be honored, yes.
In the name of research...
I think that could be pretty, uh...
repulsive.
I'm not into that kind of casual...
Oh, please.
Your people promised something
in exchange for our services.
Bring it...
and we shall gladly be on our way.
(GRUNTS)
Family reunion. Yay.
I understand she is your sister.
She's worth no more to me
than the bounty due for her on Xandar.
Our soldiers apprehended her
attempting to steal the batteries.
Do with her as you please.
(NEBULA GRUNTS)
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?
My mother is from Earth.
And your father?
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.
I see it within you.
An unorthodox genealogy.
A hybrid that seems particularly...
reckless.
You know, they told me you people
were conceited douchebags...
- but that isn't true at all.
- (CROWD GASPS)
ROCKET: Oh, shit.
I'm using my wrong eye again,
aren't I?
I'm sorry. That was meant to be

That stuff about my father...
Who does she think she is?
I know you're sensitive about that.
I'm not sensitive about it.
I just don't know who he is.
Sorry if it seemed like
I was flirting with the High Priestess.
I wasn't.
I don't care if you were.
Well, I feel like you do care.
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
Damn shadow.
There are two types of beings
in the universe...
those who dance, and those who do not.
Mmm-hmm.
I first met my beloved at a war rally.
Oh, God.
Everyone in the village
flailed about, dancing.
Except one woman.
My Ovette.
I knew immediately
she was the one for me.
The most melodic song in the world
could be playing.
She wouldn't even tap her foot.
Wouldn't move a muscle.
One might assume she was dead.
That does sound pretty hot.
It would make
my nether regions engorge.
Okay. I get it, yes.
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.
You just need to find a woman
who is pathetic... like you.
Mmm.
I'm hungry.
Hand me some of that yaro root.
No. It's not ripe yet...
and I hate you.
You hate me?
You left me there
while you stole that stone for yourself.
And yet here you stand, a hero.
I will be free of these shackles
soon enough, and I will kill you.
I swear.
No.
You're gonna live out
the rest of your days
in a prison on Xandar...
wishing you could.
- (GRUNTS)
- (ALARM BLARING)
QUILL: This is weird.
We've got a Sovereign fleet
approaching from the rear.
GAMORA: Why would they do that?
Probably because Rocket stole
some of their batteries.
Dude!
Right.
He didn't steal some of those.
I don't know why they're after us.
What a mystery this is.
- (QUILL GRUNTS)
- (GAMORA YELPS)
(WHIMPERS)
(GRUNTS)
What were you thinking?
Dude, they were really easy to steal!
- That's your defense?
- Come on!
You saw how that High Priestess
talked down to us.
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation
was altruism.
It's really a shame the Sovereign
have mistaken your intentions...
- and they're trying to kill us.
- Exactly!
I was being sarcastic!
Oh, no!
You're supposed to use
a sarcastic voice!
Now I look foolish!
Can we put the bickering on hold...
until after we survive
this massive space battle?
QUILL: More incoming!
ROCKET: Good!
I wanna kill some guys!
(ROCKET YELLING)
(CONTINUES YELLING)
GAMORA: You're not killing anyone.
All those ships are remotely piloted.
(GRUNTS)
Damn it!
(EXCITED CHATTER)
What is the delay, Admiral?
High Priestess, the batteries,
they are exceptionally combustible...
and could destroy the entire fleet.
Our concern is their slight
against our people.
We hired them and they steal from us.
It is heresy of the highest order.
All command modules...
fire with the intent to kill.
(GRUNTS)
What's the nearest habitable planet?
It's called Berhert.
- How many jumps?
- Only one.
But the access point is 47 clicks away.
And you have to go through
that quantum asteroid field.
Quill, to make it through that...
you'd have to be the greatest
pilot in the universe.
Lucky for us, I...
I am.
ROCKET: What are you doing?
I've been flying this rig
since I was 10 years old.
I was cybernetically engineered
to pilot a spacecraft.
You were cybernetically engineered
to be a douchebag!
Stop it.
Later on tonight, you're gonna be
laying down in your bed...
and there's gonna be something squishy
in your pillow case.
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"
And it's gonna be because
I put a turd in there!
You put your turd in my bed,
I shave you.
Oh, it won't be my turd.
It will be Drax's.
(DRAX LAUGHING)

GAMORA: Look at this!
Where is the other half of our ship?
QUILL: My ship.
GAMORA: Either one of you could have
gotten us through that field...
had you flown with
what's between your ears
instead of what's between your legs!
If what's between my legs
had a hand on it...
I guarantee I could have landed
this ship with it.
Peter, we almost died
because of your arrogance.
More like because he stole...
the Anulax batteries!
They're called Harbulary batteries.
No, they're not!
Do you know why I did it,
Star-Munch? Hmm?
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."
I did it because I wanted to!
Dick.
What are we even talking about this for?
We just had a little man save us
by blowing up 50 ships!
How little?
Well, I don't know, like this?
A little one-inch man saved us?
Well, if he got closer,
I'm sure he would be much larger.
That's how eyesight works,
you stupid raccoon.
Don't call me a raccoon!
I'm sorry. I took it too far.
I meant trash panda.
Is that better?
I don't know.
It's worse. It's so much worse.
You son of a...
Hey!
ROCKET: I've had it with you!
QUILL: No! Back up!
NEBULA: Someone followed you
through the jump point.
Set me free, you'll need my help.
I'm not a fool, Nebula.
You are a fool if you deprive yourself
a hand in combat.
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
No, I won't.
You'd think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.
I bet it's the one-inch man.
After all these years, I've found you.
And who the hell are you?
I figured my rugged good looks
would make that obvious.
My name is Ego...
and I'm your dad, Peter.

I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...
"but you're losing your mind!"
Then again, she's always been that way.
I could never trust her. You know?
Stakar.
It's been some time.
It seems like this establishment
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

STAKAR: There's a hundred
Ravager factions.
You lost the business of 99 of them
by serving one.
Please, sir. Please!
Get away from me.
(INHALES SHARPLY)
(GROWLS)
You can go to hell then!
I don't give a damn what you think of me!
So what are you following us for?
Because you're gonna listen to
what I gotta say!
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!
Ravagers don't deal in kids.
I told you before!
I didn't know what was going on!
You didn't know because
you didn't want to know
because it made you rich.
I demand a seat at the table!
I wear these flames, same as you.
You may dress like us...
but you'll never hear the Horns
of Freedom when you die, Yondu.
And the Colors of Ogord...
will never flash over your grave.
If you think...
I take pleasure in exiling you...
you're wrong.
You broke all our hearts.
Ah, pathetic.
First, Quill betrays us...
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.
We followed him
because he was the one...
who wasn't afraid
to do what needed to be done.
Seems he's goin' soft.
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?
You know I'm right, Kraglin.
You best be very careful
what you say about our captain.
RAVAGER: Who the hell is that?
(GRUNTING)
(SIGHS)
Yondu Udonta...
I have a proposition for you.
EGO: I hired Yondu to pick you up...
when your mother passed away.
But instead of returning you...
Yondu kept you.
I have no clue as to why.
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because I was a skinny little kid
who could squeeze into places
adults couldn't.
It made it easier for thievin'.
Well, I've been trying to
track you down ever since.
DRAX: I thought Yondu was your father.
What? We've been together
this whole time...
and you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?
You look exactly alike.
One's blue!
No, he's not my father!
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...
kicked the crap out of me
so I could learn to fight...
and kept me in terror
by threatening to eat me.
- Eat you?
- Yeah.
Oh, that son of a bitch.
How'd you locate us now?
Well, even where I reside,
out past the edge of what's known...
we've heard tell about the man
they call Star-Lord.
What say we head out there right now?
Your associates are welcome.
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.
I promise you...
it's unlike any other place
you've ever seen.
And there...
I can explain your very special heritage.
Finally get to be...
the father I've always wanted to be.
Excuse me.
I've gotta take a whiz.
I'm not buying it.
Let's go take a walk.
- (WHISTLING)
- (URINATING)
I am Mantis.
What are you doing?
Smiling.
I hear it is the thing to do
to make people like you.
Not if you do it like that.
Oh...
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.
I do not understand
the intricacies of social interaction.
Can I pet your puppy?
It is adorable.
Yes.
- (GRUNTS)
- (SCREAMS)
(LAUGHING)
That is called a practical joke!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
I liked it very much!
I just made it up!
(BOTH CONTINUE LAUGHING)
QUILL: Give me a break!
After all this time,
you're gonna show up,
and all of a sudden...
- you wanna be my dad?
- GAMORA: I hear you.
QUILL: And by the way,
this could be a trap.
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...
- they all want us dead.
- I know, but...
But what?
What was that story you told me
about Zardu Hasselfrau?
Who?
He owned a magic boat?
David Hasselhoff?
Right.
Not a magic boat. A talking car.
Why did he talk again?
To help him fight crime,
and to be supportive.
As a child, you would carry
his picture in your pocket...
and you would tell
all the other children...
that he was your father,
but that he was out of town.
Shooting Knight Rider
or touring with his band in Germany.
I told you that when I was drunk.
Why are you bringing that up now?
I love that story.
- I hate that story.
- (SIGHS)
It's so sad!
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids
off playing catch with their dad.
And I wanted that,
more than anything in the world!
That's my point, Peter.
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?
If he ends up being evil...
we will just kill him.
You're leaving me with that fox?
GAMORA: He's not a fox.
Shoot her if she does
anything suspicious.
(GRUMBLES)
- Or if you feel like it.
- ROCKET: Okay.
It'll be just a couple of days.
We'll be back before
Rocket's finished fixing the ship.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
DRAX: What if the Sovereign come?
QUILL: There's no way for them
to know we're here. Let's go.
I'm uncertain about parting ways.
God, you're like an old woman.
Because I'm wise?
GAMORA: Why do you have
so much luggage?
DRAX: I don't want Groot
playing with my things.
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy.
What is your goal here?
To get everybody to hate you?
Because it's working.
(FLEETWOOD MAC'S
"THE CHAIN" PLAYING)
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again.
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain.
And if you don't love me now.
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying.
You would never break the chain.
And if you don't love me now.
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying.
You would never break the chain
(DRAX AND QUILL LAUGHING)
QUILL: Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?
Oh...
No one has ever asked me
a personal question.
Your antennae, what are they for?
Their purpose?
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!
I say...
if you are about to go through
a doorway that is too low...
your antennae will feel this,
and keep you from being decapitated.
QUILL: Right.
And if it's anything other than...
you specifically not being decapitated
by a doorway, I win.
They are not for feeling doorways.
- (SIGHS)
- (QUILL LAUGHS)
I think...
they have something to do
with my empathic abilities.
What are those?
If I touch someone,
I can feel their feelings.
- You read minds?
- No.
Telepaths know thoughts.
Empaths feel feelings.
Emotions.
May I?
All right.
You feel love.
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,
unselfish love for just about everybody.
No!
Romantic, sexual love.
No, I don't.
- For her!
- No!
(LAUGHING)
QUILL: Okay.
(QUILL GROANS)
She just told everyone
your deepest, darkest secret!
Dude, I think
you're overreacting a little bit!
You must be so embarrassed!
(DRAX CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Do me! Do me!
I have never felt such humor!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
So unbelievably uncool.
- Oh, Quill.
- (CONTINUES LAUGHING)
Touch me, and the only thing
you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.
I can also alter emotions to some extent.
QUILL: Yeah, like what?
If I touch someone who is sad...
I can ease them into contentment
for a short while.
I can make a stubborn person compliant.
But I mostly use it
to help my master sleep.
He lies awake at night
thinking about his progeny.
Do one of those on me.
Sleep.

(SIGHS)
Hey there, rat!
How's it going, you blue idiot?
Not so bad.
We got ourselves a pretty good
little gig here.
This golden gal with
quite a high opinion of herself...
has offered us a large sum to deliver you
and your pals over to her...
because she wants
- to kill y'all.
- (ALL LAUGHING)
Your friend...
There's too many of them.
He needs my help.
If you care about him...
you need to get me out of these bonds.
They are going to kill him!
YONDU: I tell you,
it was pretty easy to find you.
I put a tracer on your ship back there...
during the war over Xandar.
Give me your word
you won't hurt Groot...
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
(CHUCKLES) Lucky for you,
my word don't mean squat.
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
Otherwise, you'd what?
We'll take them batteries.
They're worth what?
A quarter mill on the open market?
That Priestess offered us a million.
A quarter is only one third of that!
A quarter ain't a third.
A quarter is 25.
No.
GEF: We can't even buy
a pair of boots with 25 units.
YONDU: Enough!
The point is, we ain't stupid enough
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!
The whole dang Nova Corps
would be on us.
KRAGLIN: That ain't right!
I just gotta say it
this one time, Captain.
No matter how many times
Quill betrays you...
you protect him like
none of the rest of us much matter!
ALL: Yeah!
I'm the one what sticks up for you!
Take it easy, Kraglin.

Welcome, everyone, to my world.
QUILL: Wow.
You have your own planet?
Come on.
No larger than your Earth's Moon.
Humility.
I like it.
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.
(LAUGHING)
You own a planet and can destroy
two dozen spaceships without a suit.
What are you exactly?
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.
A Celestial, like a god?
Mmm, small "g," son.
At least on the days
I'm feeling humble as Drax.
(EGO CHUCKLING)
QUILL: Whoa!
I don't know where I came from exactly.
First thing I remember is flickering...
adrift in the cosmos utterly...
and entirely alone.
Over millions of years...
I learned to control
the molecules around me.
I grew smarter and stronger.
And I continued building from there...
layer by layer...
the very planet you walk on now.
Whoa.
But I wanted more.
I desired...
meaning.
"There must be some life
out there in the universe...
"besides just me," I thought.
And so, I set myself the task
of finding it.
I created...
what I imagined biological life
to be like...
down to the most minute detail.
Did you make a penis?
Dude!
What is wrong with you?
If he is a planet, how could he
make a baby with your mother?
He would smush her!
(QUILL GROANS)
I don't need to hear how my parents...
Why?
My father would tell the story
of impregnating my mother
every winter solstice.
That's disgusting.
It was beautiful.
You Earthers have hang-ups.
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.
Ha! Thank you!
It's not half bad.
- Oh.
- Ugh.
I've also got pain receptors,
and a digestive system...
and all the accompanying junk.
I wanted to experience
what it truly meant to be human...
as I set out amongst the stars...
until I found...
what I sought.
Life.
I was not alone in the universe after all.
When did you meet my mother?
Not long after.
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.
I called her my river lily.
And from that love, Peter...
you.
I have searched for you for so long.
And when I heard of a man from Earth...
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

It's Taserface?
That's right.
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

For it is a name what strikes fear...
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.
(ALL MURMURING)

You shut up.
You're next.
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...
- (ROCKET SNICKERING)
- What?
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!
I just keep imagining you
waking up in the morning, sir...
looking in the mirror and then
in all seriousness saying to yourself...
"You know what would be
a really kick-ass name?
"Taserface!" (LAUGHING)
- That's how I hear you in my head!
- (ALL SNICKERING)
What was your second choice?
- Scrotum Hat?
- (ALL LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING)
New plan. We're killing you first.
Well, dying is certainly better
than having to live an entire life...
as a moronic shitbag who thinks
Taserface is a cool name.
That's enough killing for today.
(RAVAGERS MURMURING)
RAVAGER: She's the daughter
of Thanos.
TASERFACE: I thought you were
the biggest sadist in the galaxy.
That was when Daddy
was paying my bills.
The Priestess wants to
kill the fox herself.
And he has bounties on his head
in at least 12 Kree provinces.
I assure you...
I am not as easy a mark as an old man
without his magic stick...
or a talking woodland beast.
I want 10% of the take...
and a couple more things.
KRAGLIN: We got
a whole box of hands...
- if that one don't work out.
- It is fine.
You think them Kree
is gonna execute the captain?
The Kree consider themselves merciful.
It will be painless.
Well, here it is.
It's the best ship we got.
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.
What are you gonna do with your share?
As a child, my father
would have Gamora and me
battle one another in training.
Every time my sister prevailed...
my father would replace a piece of me
with machinery...
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.
But she won...
again and again, and again,
never once refraining.
So after I murder my sister...
I will buy a warship
with every conceivable
instrument of death.
I will hunt my father like a dog,
and I will tear him apart slowly...
piece by piece...
until he knows some semblance
of the profound and unceasing pain...
I know every single day.
Yeah.
I was talking about,
like, a pretty necklace.
Or a nice hat.
Something to make the other girls go,
"Ooh, that's nice!"
Anyways, happy trails.
My mother told everyone
my father was from the stars.
She had brain cancer,
so everyone thought she was delusional.
Peter...
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this,
I really would.
But you left...
the most wonderful woman ever...
to die alone.
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.
If I don't return regularly
to my planet...
and the light within it...
this form will wither and perish.
So why didn't you come back?
Why did you send Yondu?
A criminal, of all people,
to come and fetch me?
I loved your mother, Peter!
I couldn't stand to set foot
on an Earth...
where she wasn't living!
You can't imagine what that's like!
I know exactly what that feels like!
I had to watch her die!
Over the millions and millions
of years of my existence...
I've made many mistakes, Peter.
But you're not one of them.
Please give me the chance to be
the father she would want me to be.
There's so much that I need to
teach you about this planet...
and the light within.
They are a part of you, Peter.
What do you mean?
Give me your hands, son.
Here.
Hold them like that.
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.
Take your brain
to the center of this planet.
(QUILL EXHALES DEEPLY)
(GASPS)
Yes!
Whoa!
Yes! It's okay.
Just relax. Concentrate.
You can do it. Bring it back.
Yes!
Yes, now shape it.
Feel that energy.
Yes.
You're home.
Peter...
DRAX: How did you get to
this weird, dumb planet?
MANTIS: Ego found me
in my larva state.
Orphaned on my homeworld.
He raised me by hand,
and kept me as his own.
So you're a pet?
I suppose.
People usually want cute pets.
Why would Ego want
such a hideous one?
I am hideous?
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.
But that's a good thing.
Oh?
When you're ugly,
and someone loves you...
you know they love you for who you are.
Beautiful people never know
who to trust.
Well, then I'm certainly grateful
to be ugly.
DRAX: Those pools,
they remind me of a time...
when I took my daughter
to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.
She was like you.
Disgusting?
Innocent.
(SOBS)
(SIGHS)
Drax?
There's something I must tell you.
What's going on?
This gross bug lady is my new friend.
I'm learning many things,
like I'm a pet and ugly.
You're not ugly. Drax!
What are you talking about?
GAMORA: Mantis...
can you show us where we'll be staying?
Why are there no other beings
on this planet?
MANTIS: The planet is Ego.
A dog would not invite a flea
to live on his back.
And you're not a flea?
I'm a flea with a purpose.
I help him sleep.
What were you about to say to Drax
before I walked out?
Nothing.
Your quarters are this way.
(BOTH GRUNT)
We deliver you to the Kree
in the morning.
Neither one of you will last
much longer after that.
Okay, Taserface.
Hey, tell the other guys we said...
"Hi," Taserface!
(SIGHS)
What about this little plant?
Can I smash it with a rock?
No, Gef.
It's too adorable to kill.
Take it to the tailor.
No offense, but your employees
are a bunch of jerks.
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years
when Stakar freed me.
He offered me a place
with the Ravagers.
He said all I needed to do
was adhere to the code.
But I was young...
and greedy, and stupid.
Like you stealing those batteries.
That was mostly Drax.
Me and Stakar and the other captains...
we weren't so different from
you and your friends.
The only family I ever had.
When I broke the code...
they exiled me.
This is what I deserve.
Slow down, drama queen.
You might deserve this, but I don't.
We gotta get outta here.
Where's Quill?
He went off with his old man.
- Ego?
- Yeah.
It's a day for dumbass names.
(CHUCKLES)
You're smiling.
And for a second, I got a warm feeling.
But then it was ruined
by those disgusting-ass teeth.
You like a professional asshole or what?
Pretty much a pro.
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego
like you promised?
He was skinny.
Could fit into places we couldn't.
Good for thievin'.
Uh-huh.
I got an idea on how to get outta here.
But we're gonna need your little friend.

Hey, twig!

Aw, man...
what did they do to you?
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?
There's something I need you to get,
and bring back to me.
In the captain's quarters,
there's a prototype fin...
the thing I wore on my head.
There's a drawer next to the bunk.
It's in that. It's red.
You got it?
(RAVAGERS SNORING)
That's my underwears.
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know
what you were talkin' about.
You have to explain it more careful.
It's a prototype fin.
(SCREECHING)
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.
You explain it this time.
All right.
YONDU: That's Vorker's eye.
He takes it out when he sleeps.
Go. Look again.
But leave the eye here.
Why?
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...
and he's not gonna know...
where his eye is! (LAUGHING)
That's a desk.
We told you it was this big.
Tell me you guys have
a refrigerator somewhere...
with a bunch of severed human toes.
Okay. Then let's just agree
to never discuss this.
The drawer you wanna open
has this symbol on it.
Okay?
What? No!
He thinks you want him
to wear it as a hat.
That's not what I said!
I am Groot.
He's relieved you don't want him to.
- I am Groot.
- He hates hats.
I am Groot.
On anyone, not just himself.
I am Groot.
One minute you think someone
has a weird-shaped head...
the next minute it's just because
you realize part of that head is the hat.
That's why you don't like hats?
This is an important conversation
right now?

Cheers, Sam and Diane...
a guy and a girl on a TV show
who dig each other...
but never say it because if they do,
the ratings would go down...
sort of thing.
There's no unspoken thing.
Well, it's a catch-22,
because if you said it,
then it would be spoken...
and you would be a liar.
So, by not saying it...
you are telling the truth,
and admitting that there is.
No, that's not what I...

What we should be discussing right now

It doesn't feel right.
What are you talking about?
You're the one who wanted me
to come here!
That girl Mantis...
she's afraid of something.
Why are you trying to take this
away from me?
I'm not trying...
He's my father. He's blood.
You have blood on Earth
and you never wanted to return there.
Again, you made me come here!
And Earth is the place
where my mother died in front of me.
No, it's because that place is real,
and this is a fantasy.
This is real!
I'm only half human, remember?
That's the half I'm worried about.
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...
because I'm part-god,
and you like when I'm the weak one.
You were insufferable to begin with.
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna try and get a signal.
You know what?
This is not Cheers after all!
This is whatever the show is
where one person is willing...
to open themselves up
to new possibility,
and the other person is a jerk...
who doesn't trust anybody!
It's a show that doesn't exist.

(CHUCKLES) A favorite of your mom's.
Yeah, it was.
One of Earth's greatest
musical compositions.
Perhaps its very greatest.
Yes!
Peter, you and I,
we're the sailor in that song.
He came on a summer's day.
Bringing gifts from far away.
Like the child I put in your mother...
or the freedom you brought Gamora.
Brandy, you're a fine girl.
What a good wife you would be.
My life, my love.
My lady is the sea.
The sea calls the sailor back.
He loves the girl,
but that's not his place.
The sea calls upon him
as history calls upon great men.
And sometimes we are deprived
the pleasures of mortals.
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...
No, Peter...
death will remain a stranger
to both of us...
as long as the light
burns within the planet.
I'm immortal?
Mmm-hmm.
Really?
Yes! As long as the light exists.
And I can use the light
to build cool things...
like how you made this whole planet?
It might take you
a few million years of practice...
before you get really good at it.
But, yes!
What!
Get ready for an 800-foot statue
of Pac-Man with Skeletor...
and Heather Locklear.
You can do anything you want.
I'm gonna make some weird shit.
But you know, Peter,
it is a tremendous responsibility.
Only we can remake the universe.
Only we can take the bridle
of the cosmos...
and lead it to where it needs to go.
How?
Come with me.
(GASPS)
(SNORING)
Drax, Drax. Drax!
Drax! We need to talk.
I'm sorry.
But I like a woman
with some meat on her bones.
What?
I tried to let you down easily
by telling you I found you disgusting.
No, that's not what I...
(RETCHING)
What are you doing?
I'm imagining being with you physically.
Drax...
I don't like you like that.
I don't even like
the type of thing you are.
Hey! There's no need to get personal.
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly
what he wanted.
I should have told you earlier.
I'm stupid. You are in danger.
(BOTH PANTING)
What is that?
Now, you need to readjust
the way you process life.
Everything around us,
including the girl...
Everything is temporary.
We are forever.
Doesn't eternity get boring?
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...
which is why you're here.
I told you how all those years ago...
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.
But what I did not tell you was how,
when I finally did find it...
it was all so...
disappointing.
And that is when I came...
to a profound realization.
My innate desire to seek out other life...
was not so that I could
walk among that life.
Peter...
I have found meaning.
(GASPING)
I see it.
Eternity!
Oh, my God.
We need to get off this planet.
(ALL SCREAMING)
Oh, man.
Anyway, before I was
so rudely interrupted...
At that time,
I was a Federal Express man.
(ALL SCREAMING)
(BOTH GROAN)
What the hell you doing, boy?
I could tell
by how you talked about him...
this Ego is bad news.
We're here to save Quill.
For what? Huh?
For honor? For love?
No. I don't care about those things.
I wanna save Quill
so I can prove I'm better than him!
I can lord this over him forever.
(LAUGHING)
What are you laughing at me for?
You can fool yourself and everyone else,
but you can't fool me.
I know who you are.
You don't know anything
about me, loser.
I know everything about you.
I know you play like
you're the meanest and the hardest...
but, actually,
you're the most scared of all.
Shut up!
I know you steal batteries
you don't need...
and you push away anyone
who's willing to put up with you...
because just a little bit of love...
reminds you how big and empty
that hole inside you actually is.
I said shut up!
I know them scientists what made you,
never gave a rat's ass about you.
I'm serious, dude!
Just like my own damn parents
who sold me...
their own little baby, into slavery.
I know who you are, boy.
Because you're me.
What kind of a pair are we?
The kind that's about to
go fight a planet, I reckon.
All right, okay! Good. Wait.
Fight a what?
(GAMORA YELLS)
Who are you people?
What is this place?
Gamora, let her go!
The bodies in the caverns...
Who are they?
You are scared.
(MANTIS COUGHING)
I call it the Expansion.
It is my purpose...
and now it is yours as well.
It's beautiful.
Over thousands of years...
I implanted thousands
of extensions of myself...
on thousands of worlds.
I need to fulfill
life's one true purpose...
To grow and spread...
covering all that exists...
until everything is...
Me!
What did she do to me?
She already told me everything.
I only had one problem.
A single Celestial
doesn't have enough power
for such an enterprise.
But two Celestials...
Well, now, that just might do.
The bodies...
are his children.
EGO: Out of all my labors...
the most beguiling was...
attempting to graft my DNA
with that of another species.
I hoped the result of such a coupling
would be enough...
to power the Expansion.
I had Yondu deliver
some of them to me.
It broke the Ravager code,
but I compensated him generously...
and to ease his conscience,
I said I'd never hurt them.
I mean, that was true.
They never felt a thing.
But one after the other, they failed me.
Not one of them carried
the Celestial genes.
Until you, Peter.
Out of all my spawn...
only you carried
the connection to the light.
We need to find Peter now,
and get off this damn planet.
Ego will have won him
to his side by now.
- Then we just go.
- No!
- He's our friend.
- All any of you do...
is yell at each other.
You are not friends.
You're right.
We're family.
We leave no one behind.
Except maybe you.
Oh, my God.
For the first time in my existence...
I am truly not alone!
What is it, son?
My friends.
You see,
that's the mortal in you, Peter.
Yes.
We are beyond such things.
Yes.
- Now...
- But my mother...
You said you loved my mother.
And that I did.
My river lily who knew all the words
to every song that came over the radio.
I returned to Earth
to see her three times.
And I knew if I returned a fourth...
I'd never leave.
The Expansion...
the reason for my very existence,
would be over.
So, I did what I had to do.
But it broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.
What?
Now, all right...
I know that sounds bad.
(GROANING)
Who in the hell do you think you are?
You killed my mother!
I tried...
so hard...
to find the form...
that best suited you...
and this is the thanks I get?
You really need to grow up.
- (GASPS)
- I wanted to do this together...
but I suppose you'll have to learn
by spending the next thousand years
as a battery!
(TRANSMITTER BEEPING)
Finally! Rocket?
Keep that transmitter nearby,
so I can find you.
We're in an old piece of construction
equipment Yondu once used...
to slice open the Bank of A 'askavaria.
Ego's unhinged.
ROCKET: I know. Get ready.
Drop her, Kraglin.
(GRUNTS)

Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!
(BABY GROOT GRUNTING)
I told you something didn't feel right.
"I told you so."
Just what I need to hear right now.
Well, I came back, didn't I?
Because there's an unspoken thing.
There is no unspoken thing.
What are you doing?
You could've killed us all!
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?
We had it under control.
We did not.
That is only an extension...
of his true self.
He will be back soon.
What's Smurfette doing here?
Whatever I need to do to get
a damn ride home.
She tried to murder me!
I saved you, you stupid fox!
He's not a fox.
- I am Groot.
- I'm not a raboon, either.
I am Groot.
"Raccoon." Whatever.
How do we kill a Celestial?
There's a center to him.
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...
Some sort of protective shell.
It's in the caverns...
below the surface.
- Yondu?
- (GRUNTS)
(QUILL GRUNTS)
(ALL YELP)
Thrusters are out.
Guess I should be glad
I was a skinny kid.
Otherwise, you'd have
delivered me to this maniac.
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?
That's what you told me, you old doofus.
Once I figured out
what happened to them other kids...
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.
You said you were gonna eat me.
That was being funny!
Not to me!
You people have issues.
Of course I have issues.
That's my freakin' father!
Thrusters are back up.
(EGO YELLING)
(ALL GRUNT)
- We should be going up!
- QUILL: We can't!
Ego wants to eradicate
the universe as we know it.
We have to kill him.
Rocket!
Got it!
QUILL: Whoo-hoo!
So, we're saving the galaxy again?
I guess.
Awesome!
We're really gonna be able to
jack up our prices...
if we're two-time galaxy savers.
I seriously can't believe
that's where your mind goes.
It was just a random thought, man.
I thought we were friends.
Of course, I care about the planets,
and the buildings...
and all the animals on the planets.
And the people.
Meh.
The crabby puppy is so cute.
He makes me wanna die!

(TRANSMISSION BREAKING UP)
Tell me why Ego wants you here?
He needs my genetic connection
to the light...
to help destroy the universe.
He tried to teach me
how to control the power.
So, could you?
A little.
I made a ball.
A ball?
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.
You "thought"?
You think when I make this arrow fly...
- I use my head?
- (GROANS)
(GRUNTING)
(ALL YELP)
Whoa.
There.
That's Ego's core.
GAMORA: That ore is thick, Rocket.
I got it covered.
We must hurry.
It will not take Ego long to find us.
Keep it steady.
We drill into the center, we kill him!
KRAGLIN: Captain?

Why aren't you firing the lasers?
They blew out the generator.
I think I packed a small detonator.
A detonator is worthless
without explosives.
Well, we got these.
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...
throughout his entire nervous system.
Meaning what?
The entire planet will explode.
We'll have to get out of here fast.
I rigged a timer.
QUILL: Go!
(QUILL GRUNTING)
He's coming.
Didn't you say
you could make him sleep?
When he wants. He's too powerful.
I can't!
You don't have to believe in yourself...
because I believe in you.
(GASPING)
(YELLS)
Sleep!
(GASPS)
I never thought she'd be able to do it...
with as weak and skinny
as she appears to be.
I don't know how long I can hold him.
ROCKET: The metal's too thick.
For the bomb to work, we'd actually
need to place it on Ego's core.
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit
through those tiny holes.
QUILL: Well...
That's a terrible idea.
Which is the only kind of idea
we have left.
(GROANS) Unbelievable.
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."
(SIGHS) What a day.
All right, first you flick this switch,
then this switch.
That activates it.
Then you push this button...
which will give you five minutes
to get out of there.
Now, whatever you do...
don't push this button...
because that will set off
the bomb immediately
and we'll all be dead.
Now, repeat back what I just said.
- I am Groot.
- Uh-huh.
- I am Groot.
- That's right.
- I am Groot.
- No!
No, that's the button
that will kill everyone!
Try again.
Hmm...

No! That's exactly what you just said!
How is that even possible?
Which button is the button
you're supposed to push?
Point to it.
No!
QUILL: Hey, you're
making him nervous!
Shut up and get me some tape!
Does anybody have any tape out there?
I wanna put some tape
over the death button.
I don't have any tape. Let me check.
Yo, Yondu... Ow!
Do you have any tape?
(QUILL GROANING)
Gamora? Do you have any tape?
Tape!
Never mind. Ow!
Drax, do you have any tape?
- (ROCKET COUGHS)
- Yes, Scotch tape would work.
Then why did you ask me
if Scotch tape would work,
if you don't have any?
Nobody has any tape!
Not a single person has tape?
Nope!
Did you ask Nebula?
Yes!
Are you sure?
I asked Yondu...
- and she was sitting next to him.
- I knew you were lying!
You have priceless batteries
and an atomic bomb in your bag.
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!
That's exactly my point!
I have to do everything!
You are wasting a lot of time here!
Whee!
We're all gonna die.
YONDU: Rear thrusters are out again!
- We're done for without that generator!

QUILL: I told Gamora...
how when I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.
He's a singer and actor from Earth,
really famous guy.
Earlier, it struck me...
Yondu didn't have a talking car,
but he did have a flying arrow.
He didn't have
the beautiful voice of an angel...
but he did have the whistle of one.
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures...
and hooked up with hot women...
and fought robots.
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of
end up being my dad after all.
Only it was you, Yondu.
I had a pretty cool dad.
What I'm trying to say here is...
sometimes that thing
you're searching for your whole life...
it's right there by your side all along.
You don't even know it.
(SNIFFLES)
I am Groot.
He did call you twig.
Nebula...
I was a child like you.
I was concerned with staying alive
until the next day, every day.
And I never considered
what Thanos was doing to you.
I'm trying to make it right.
There are little girls like you...
across the universe who are in danger.
You can stay with us and help them.
I will help them by killing Thanos.
I don't know if that's possible.

I am not boring. You're boring.
You know what's boring?
Sitting there,
playing that mind-numbing game.
What's boring is me tripping over
your vines every day!
I'm not boring!
I am Groot.
And now I know how Yondu felt.
HASSELHOFF:
In these times of hardship...
just remember...
We. Are. Groot.
Hey, fellas.
Wait, where are you going?
You were supposed to be my lift home.
How will I get out of here?
Hey! Aw, gee...
I've got so many more stories to tell.
Aw, guys.
Oh, gee...

Now, I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"
Well, sometimes you have to get captured
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.
See, I spent some time on Earth...
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.
Then I went searching through the Cosmos
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.
Didn't find any.
That's when I came across
a path of death and destruction,
which led me all the way here
into this cage,
where I met you.
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?
Thor, son of Odin.
Surtur, son of a bitch.
You're still alive.
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.
I cannot die.
Not until I fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home.
It's funny you should mention that.
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.
And you, Surtur,
are at the center of all of them.
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.
Hang on.
I'll be back around shortly.
I really feel like
we were connecting there.
Okay, so Ragnarok.
Tell me about that. Walk me through it.
My time has come.
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame,
I shall be restored to my full might.
I will tower over the mountains,
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...
Hang on. Give it a second.
I swear, I'm not even moving.
It's just doing this on its own.
I'm really sorry.
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame
and then you'll suddenly grow as big
as a house?
A mountain!
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps
locked away on Asgard?
Odin is not on Asgard.
And your absence has left the throne
defenseless.
Okay, so where is it? This crown?
This is my crown,
the source of my power.
Oh, that's a crown.
I thought it was a big eyebrow.
It's a crown.
Anyway, it sounds like
all I have to do to stop Ragnarok
is rip that thing off your head.
But Ragnarok has already begun.
You cannot stop it.
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.
All will suffer, all will burn.
That's intense.
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.
But it looks like I'm gonna have to
choose option B,
where I bust out of these chains,
knock that tiara off your head,
and stash it away in Asgard's vault.
You cannot stop Ragnarok.
Why fight it?
Because that's what heroes do.
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.
And, now!
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.
I make grave mistakes all the time.
Everything seems to work out.
Heimdall, I know it's been a while,
but I could really use a fast exit.
Heimdall?
Heimdall was an idiot.
This job should have made him rich.
Now, the job ain't easy
but it does have its benefits.
The Bifrost gives me access to
everything the Nine Realms has to offer.
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.
Behold...
My stuff.
I'm particularly fond of these.
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard
called Texas.
I even named them. Des and Troy.
You see, when you put them together,
they destroy.
Heimdall, come on.
Stay!
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.
Heimdall?
Skurge?
Is that important?
You girls are in for a treat.
Girls!
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.
Thanks for scaring away my company
and drenching my workplace in brains.
Who are you?
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge.
We fought together on Vanaheim.
Right. Where is Heimdall?
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.
Traitor?
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall
with negligence of duty
but he disappeared before the trial.
Hard to catch a guy who can see
everything in the universe.
Sure.
Hold on.
I'm supposed to announce your arrival.
What the hell is that?
Oh, brother. This is it.
I take my leave.
You fool, you didn't listen!
I'm sorry.
Lady Sif, get help!
Somebody, help!
Sorry for all I've done.
It's all right. Hold on.
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.
They'd be lucky to have you.
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.
I'm a trickster.
So mischievous.
Sorry about that time I turned you
into a frog.
It was a wonderful joke.
'Twas indeed hilarious.
You are the savior of Asgard.
- Tell my story.
- I will.
Build a statue for me.
We will build a big statue for you.
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.
I will tell Father
what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
And so, Loki died of his wounds,
giving his life for ours.
He fought back those disgusting elves,
he brought peace to the realm.
Loki, my boy...
'Twas many moons ago I found you
on that frostbitten battlefield.
On that day,
I did not yet see in you
Asgard's savior. No.
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle
that melted this old fool's heart.
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.
Father.
Shit.
My son, Thor, has returned!
Greetings, my boy.
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.
The people wanted to commemorate him.
Indeed they should.
I like the statue.
A lot better looking than he was
when he was alive, though.
A little less weaselly, less greasy,
maybe.
Do you know what this is?
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster
and destroy the whole planet.
Thank you, dear.
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?
Nope.
I've been having this reoccurring dream
lately.
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.
That's just a silly dream,
signs of an overactive imagination.
Possibly.
But then I decide to go out there
and investigate.
And what do I find,
but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise,
all while you, Odin,
the protector of those Nine Realms,
are sitting here in your bathrobe,
eating grapes.
Yes, it is best
to respect our neighbors' freedom.
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.
Watching theater.
Board meetings,
and security council meetings...
- You're really gonna make me do it?
- Do what?
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir
as it returns to my hand.
Not even your face.
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.
Then I'll see you on the other side,
brother.
All right, I yield.
Behold!
Thor...
- Odinson.
- No.
You had one job. Just the one.
Where's Odin?
You just couldn't stay away, could you?
Everything was fine without you.
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.
- Ask them.
- Where's Father? Did you kill him?
You had what you wanted.
You had the independence you asked for.
Okay. I know exactly where he is.
I swear I left him right here.
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there
where the building is being demolished?
Great planning.
How was I supposed to know?
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.
No? Then why do you dress like one?
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.
I saw you die.
I mourned you, I cried for you.
I'm honored.
Ask him.
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture
with us?
Sure.
Start figuring out where he is.
Oh, my God.
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
She didn't dump me, you know.
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.
What's this? What are you doing?
This isn't me.
Loki.
Thor Odinson.
God of Thunder.
You can put down the umbrella.
So, Earth has wizards now?
The preferred term is
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.
All right, wizard. Who are you?
Why should I care?
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange,
and I have some questions for you.
Take a seat.
Tea?
I don't drink tea.
What do you drink?
Not tea.
So, I keep a watch list of individuals
and beings from other realms
that may be a threat to this world.
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.
He's a worthy inclusion.
Then why bring him here?
We're looking for my father.
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was,
all parties concerned
would promptly return to Asgard?
Promptly.
Great! Then I'll help you.
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?
I have to tell you, he was adamant
that he not be disturbed.
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.
And you don't have a phone.
No, I don't have a phone,
but you could have sent an electronic
letter. It's called an email.
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.
So if you could tell me where he is,
I can take him home.
Gladly. He's in Norway.
I'm just seeing whether this incantation
requires any Asgardian modifications.
Nope.
We don't need that.
Will you stop doing that?
I need just one strand of your hair.
Let me explain something.
My hair is not to be meddled with.
We could have just walked.
He's waiting for you.
All right.
Don't forget your umbrella.
Yes.
Sorry.
There we go.
I suppose I'll need my brother back.
Yeah. Right.
I have been falling for 30 minutes!
You can handle him from here.
Yes. Of course.
Thank you very much for your help.
Good luck.
Handle me? Who are you?
Loki.
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...
Bye-bye.
Father?
Look at this place. It's beautiful.
Father, it's us.
My sons.
I've been waiting for you.
I know. We've come to take you home.
Home, yes.
Your mother, she calls me.
Do you hear it?
Loki, lift your magic.
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.
Frigga would have been proud.
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.
I know we failed you.
But we can make this right.
I failed you.
It is upon us. Ragnarok.
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.
No.
It has already begun. She's coming.
My life was all that held her back.
But my time has come.
I cannot keep her away any longer.
Father, who are you talking about?
Goddess of Death. Hela.
My firstborn.
Your sister.
Your what?
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her.
Locked her away.
She draws her strength from Asgard,
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.
Whatever she is, we can stop her together.
We can face her together.
No, we won't.
I'm on a different path now.
This you must face alone.
I love you, my sons.
Look at that.
Remember this place.
Home.
Brother.
This was your doing.
So he's gone.
That's a shame.
I would've liked to have seen that.
You must be Hela.
I'm Thor, son of Odin.
Really? You don't look like him.
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.
You sound like him.
Kneel.
Beg your pardon?
Kneel.
Before your queen.
I don't think so.
It's not possible.
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.
Bring us back!
No!
Loki!
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?
I'm Hela.
I'm just a janitor.
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.
How would you like a job?
Are you a fighter?
Or are you food?
I'm just passing through.
It is food.
On your knees.
He's mine.
Wait!
Wait!
He's mine.
So if you want him, you go through me.
But we've already got him.
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.
More food.
Thank you.
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.
I've got something special.
Hey! Where are you taking me?
Answer me!
Hey!
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.
Many apologies, your majesty.
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard,
the rightful heir to the throne,
and the Goddess of Death.
My father is dead.
As are the princes.
You're welcome.
We were once the seat
of absolute power in the Cosmos.
Our supremacy was unchallenged.
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.
Our destiny is to rule over all others.
And I am here to restore that power.
Kneel before me
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.
Whoever you are,
whatever you've done, surrender now!
Or we will show you no mercy.
Whoever I am?
Did you listen to a word I said?
This is your last warning!
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Fine.
Charge!
I've missed this.
Still, it's a shame.
Good soldiers dying for nothing,
all because
they couldn't see the future.
Sad.
Look, still alive.
Change of heart?
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.
You evil demoness!
Let's go see my palace.
Fear not, for you are found.
You are home,
and there is no going back.
No one leaves this place.
But what is this place?
The answer is Sakaar.
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.
It is the collection point
for all lost and unloved things.
Like you.
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.
You are valuable.
Here you are loved.
What the hell?
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.
He is the original,
the first lost and the first found.
The creator of Sakaar,
and father of the Contest of Champions.
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.
You are the property of the Grandmaster.
Congratulations!
You will meet the Grandmaster
in five seconds.
Prepare yourself.
Prepare yourself.
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.
He's wonderful.
It is a he?
It is a he.
Yeah.
I love when you come to visit, 142.
You bring me the best stuff.
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz,
about Scrapper 142,
what do I always say? "She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."
Trash.
No, not trash.
Were you waiting just to call her that?
It doesn't start with a "B."
Booze hag.
I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."
'Cause I always say you're the best.
She brought me my beloved champion,
you know.
You say that every time she's here.
What have you brought today? Tell me.
A contender.
A what?
I need to go closer.
I want to get a closer look at this.
Can you take us closer? Thank you.
Pay this lady.
Just wait a damn minute.
I'm not for sale.
Man, he's a fighter.
I take 10 million.
Tell her she's dreaming.
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.
You'll pay for this.
No, I got paid for this.
Here's what I wanna know.
Who are you?
I am the God of Thunder.
I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your
fingers, was that sparkles?
We've located your cousin.
Good!
Yeah, come on.
I think you're gonna like this.
There he is.
Hey, cuz.
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?
Hi.
So...
Please.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Carlo...
I pardon you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're officially pardoned.
From life.
Help me.
Oh, my God!
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!
The smell.
What does it smell like?
Burnt toast.
What happened to my manners?
I haven't properly introduced myself.
Come on. Follow me.
My name is Grandmaster.
I preside over a little harlequinade
called the Contest of Champions.
People come from far and wide
to unwillingly participate in it.
And you, my friend,
might just be part of the new cast.
What do you say to that?
We're not friends and I don't give a shit
about your games.
I'm going back to Asgard.
Ass-gard.
One, two, three, four.
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.
At that moment, I let go.
Loki?
Loki! Loki!
Over here. Over here.
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!
- What?
- You're alive?
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.
- Get me out of this one. Get me out.
- I can't.
- I can't.
- What?
I've made friends with this man.
He's called the Grandmaster.
- He's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.
The Bifrost brought me out here
weeks ago.
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.
I just got here.
What are you whispering about?
Time works real different
around these parts.
On any other world, I'd be, like,
millions of years old.
But here on Sakaar...
In any case, you know this...
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
God of Thunder.
Tell him.
I've never met this man in my life.
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.
Is he any kind of a fighter?
You take this thing out of my neck
and I'll show you.
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.
If you wanna get back to Ass-place,
Assberg...
Asgard.
Any contender who defeats my champion,
their freedom they shall win.
Fine. Then point me in the direction
of whoever's ass I have to kick!
That's what I call, contender.
Direction would be this way, Lord.
Loki!
Hey. Take it easy, man.
Over here.
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.
I'm kind of like the leader in here.
I'm made of rocks, as you can see.
But don't let that intimidate you.
You don't need to be afraid
unless you're made of scissors.
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke
for you.
This is my very good friend over here,
Miek.
He's an insect and has knives for hands.
You're a Kronan, aren't you?
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?
Well, I tried to start a revolution,
but didn't print enough pamphlets.
So hardly anyone turned up, except for
my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.
As punishment, I was forced
to be in here and become a gladiator.
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.
I don't know if you'd be interested
in something like that.
Do you reckon you'd be interested?
How did you...
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.
- This doesn't make any sense.
- No, nothing makes sense here, man.
The only thing that does make sense
is that nothing makes sense.
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?
Doug has.
Doug!
Our luck, Doug's dead.
That's right.
Everyone who fights
the Grandmaster's champion perishes.
What about you? You're made of rocks.
Perishable rock.
There you go. Another one gone.
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights,
warm up the crowd and whatnot.
Wait. You're not gonna face him,
are you?
Yes, I am.
Gonna fight him, win,
and get the hell out of this place.
That's exactly what Doug used to say.
See you later, new Doug.
Does no one remember me?
Has no one been taught our history?
Look at these lies.
Goblets and garden parties?
Peace treaties?
Odin...
Proud to have it,
ashamed of how he got it.
We were unstoppable.
I was his weapon in the conquest
that built Asgard's empire.
One by one, the realms became ours.
But then,
simply because my ambition outgrew his,
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.
Before that,
Asgard's warriors were honored,
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.
Most of the stuff in here is fake.
Or weak.
Smaller than I thought it would be.
That's not bad.
But this...
The Eternal Flame.
Want to see what true power
really looks like?
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
I've missed you.
I've missed you all.
Odin,
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla,
where the brave shall live forever.
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,
for those that have died
the glorious death.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Being lied to.
Being told you're one thing
and then learning it's all a fiction.
You didn't think
I'd really come and see you, did you?
This place is disgusting.
Does this mean you don't want my help?
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position
with the Grandmaster.
It took me time to win his trust.
He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.
What I'm telling you is, you could
join me at the Grandmaster's side.
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?
Our sister destroyed your hammer
like a piece of glass.
She's stronger than both of us.
She's stronger than you.
You don't stand a chance.
Do you understand
what I'm saying here?
Fine.
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.
Like I've always done.
Would you say something?
Say something!
What would you like me to say?
You faked your own death,
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power,
stranded him on Earth to die,
releasing the Goddess of Death.
Have I said enough or would you like me
to go back further than the past two days?
You know, I haven't seen this
beloved champion he talks of,
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.
I've placed a large wager against you
tomorrow.
Don't let me down.
Piss off, ghost!
He's freaking gone.
Yuck!
There's still someone's hair and blood
all over this.
Guys, can you clean up the weapons
once you finish your fight?
Disgusting slobs.
Thor,
wanna use a big wooden fork?
No.
Yeah, not really useful.
Unless you're fighting off three vampires
that were huddled together.
I really wish I had my hammer.
Hammer?
Quite unique.
It was made from this special metal
from the heart of a dying star.
And when I spun it really, really fast,
it gave me the ability to fly.
You rode a hammer?
No, I didn't ride the hammer.
The hammer rode you on your back?
No. I used to spin it really fast,
and it would pull me off the...
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?
The ground. It would pull me off the
ground, up into the air, and I would fly.
Every time I threw it,
it would always come back to me.
Sounds like you had a pretty special
and intimate relationship with this hammer
and that losing it was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.
That's a nice way of putting it.
I said they're mine.
See her,
that's the one that put me in here.
Yeah. Scrapper 142.
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.
They are hard to perish.
Asgardian?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.
Asgard is in danger.
My God, you're a Valkyrie.
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger,
until I found out that
you were all women.
There's nothing wrong with women,
of course. I love women.
Sometimes a little too much.
Not in a creepy way,
just more of a respectful appreciation.
I think it's great that there is
an elite force of women warriors.
It's about time.
Are you done?
Lord of Thunder, you're up.
Please, help me. I need your help.
Bye.
Fine, then you must be a traitor
or a coward.
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect
the throne.
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.
Bring him in for processing.
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.
Now, don't you move.
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair,
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.
Please.
Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.
Please! No!
No!
Look at all of you.
What a show! What a night!
Who's having fun?
Please, I'm your host.
Big round of applause
for all of our undercard competitors,
who today died so gruesomely.
Good sports.
What a show! What a night!
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.
And now, without further ado,
it's main event time.
Making his first appearance,
though he looks quite promising,
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.
I'll say no more, see what you think.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Lord of Thunder.
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.
Okay, this is it.
Let's get ready to welcome this guy.
Here he comes.
He is a creature.
What can we say about him?
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.
I feel a special connection with him.
He's undefeated.
He's the reigning.
He's the defending.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you...
Your Incredible...
Hulk!
Yes!
I have to get off this planet.
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
Hey!
We know each other.
He's a friend from work.
Where have you been?
Everybody thought you were dead.
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer.
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?
He's up there.
Loki! Look who it is!
Banner,
I never thought I would say this,
but I'm happy to see you.
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!
Banner.
Hey, Banner!
No Banner. Only Hulk.
What are you doing?
It's me. It's Thor!
Banner, we're friends.
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!
Here we go.
What?
Hey, big guy.
The sun's getting real low.
That's it.
The sun's going down.
I won't hurt you anymore.
No one will.
Yes!
That's how it feels!
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.
All right. Screw it.
I know you're in there, Banner.
I'll get you out!
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!
I told them we were friends!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Another day, another Doug.
What is that noise?
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.
There's a resistance trying to knock down
the front gates.
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there.
What I meant was,
what's your ambition?
I just want a chance to prove myself.
Recognition.
When I was young,
every great king had an executioner.
Not just to execute people,
but also to execute their vision.
But mainly to execute people.
Still, it was a great honor.
I was Odin's executioner.
And you shall be my executioner.
Let's begin our conquest.
Skurge, where's the sword?
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.
Those people you mentioned,
the ones who aren't falling into line...
Round them up.
Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
These bloody things are everywhere.
Come on.
You'll be safe here.
Are we cool?
It's Hulk in a hot tub.
So how long
have you been like that?
Like what?
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.
Hulk always Hulk.
How'd you get here?
Winning.
You mean cheating?
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?
How'd you arrive here?
Quinjet.
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?
That's naked.
He's very naked.
It's in my brain now.
Quinjet.
Yes!
I'm getting us out of here.
This terrible, awful place.
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.
Hulk stay.
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.
We must prevent Ragnarok.
Ragnarok?
The prophesied death of my home world.
The end of days, it's the end of...
If you help me get back to Asgard,
I can help you get back to Earth.
Earth hate Hulk.
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.
You're one of the Avengers.
One of the team, one of our friends.
This is what friends do.
They support each other.
You're Banner's friend.
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.
Banner's friend.
I don't even like Banner.
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."
Thor go. Hulk stay.
Fine.
Stay here.
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.
The red, the white. Just pick a color.
Ridiculous.
Smash you.
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.
- Baby arms.
- What?
Baby.
Moron! You big child.
Thor go!
I am going.
Thor go again.
Thor home.
Hulk trains.
That's great. Have fun.
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.
What have you been up to?
Winning.
Heimdall, I know you can see me.
I need you to help me.
Help me see.
I see you, but you're far away.
What's going on here?
Come see for yourself.
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold
built by our ancestors.
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?
We won't last long if we stay.
She draws her power from Asgard
and grows stronger every day.
Come on.
Hela is ravenous.
If I let her leave, she'll consume
Nine Realms and all the Cosmos.
We need you.
I'm working on it. But I don't even know
where the hell I am.
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.
- Which one?
- The big one.
Thor sad.
Shut up.
Thor sad.
I'm not sad, you idiot.
I'm pissed off!
Angry. I lost my father.
I lost my hammer.
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby.
- You're not even listening.
Don't kick stuff.
You're being a really bad friend.
You bad friend!
- You know what we call you?
- No.
We call you the stupid Avenger.
You're tiny Avenger!
What, are you crazy?
Yes.
You know what? Earth does hate you.
No.
I'm sorry I said those things.
You're not the stupid Avenger.
Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.
It's okay.
You just can't go around throwing shields
at people. Could have killed me.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just get so angry all the time.
Hulk always, always angry.
I know.
We're the same, you and I.
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.
Yeah, same.
Hulk like fire, Thor like water.
We're kind of both like fire.
But Hulk like real fire.
Hulk like raging fire.
Thor like smoldering fire.
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.
Angry girl.
What's going on? What are you...
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell
when someone's hiding all the way across
the universe and wants to be left alone?
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.
I need her to stay.
Stay?
Block.
Stay.
- Please.
- Please.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I'll listen to you
till this is empty.
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.
We need to get back there.
I need your help.
Finished. Bye.
Odin is dead.
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.
I'm going to stop her.
- Alone?
- Nope.
I'm putting together a team.
It's me, you, and the big guy.
No. No team. Only Hulk.
It's me and you.
I think it's only you.
Please, listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.
I'm not getting dragged into
another one of Odin's family squabbles.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.
When it grew beyond Odin's control
she massacred everyone in the palace
and tried to seize the throne.
When she tried
to escape her banishment
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.
I only survived because...
Look, I already faced her once
back when I believed in the throne,
and it cost me everything.
That's what's wrong with Asgard.
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.
I agree.
Don't get familiar.
I agree.
That's why I turned down the throne.
But this isn't about the crown.
This is about the people.
They're dying
and they're your people, too.
Forget it.
I have.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Good. Great.
- Great.
Thank you.
- For what?
- For this.
Didn't see that, did you?
There... That's better.
You know, go ahead.
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.
Keep drinking, keep hiding.
But me...
I choose to run toward my problems
and not away from them.
Because that's what...
Because that's what heroes do.
Friend stay!
Yes!
All right.
Come on.
Welcome. Voice activation required.
Thor.
Access denied.
Thor, son of Odin.
Access denied.
God of Thunder.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Damn you, Stark.
Point Break.
Welcome, Point Break.
Friend stay!
No, no, no!
Stop!
Stay!
Hulk, stop breaking everything!
Don't go!
Nice work, big guy.
We don't know where Ultron's headed,
but you're going very high, very fast.
So, I need you to turn this bird around,
okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode,
so I need you to help me out. Okay?
I need you to...
No! No, Banner!
Oh, jeez.
Banner.
Hey, hey, hey.
You all right, Banner?
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.
That's it, breathe.
I won't hurt you.
Sun's going down.
- Thor.
- Yeah.
What happened to your hair?
Some creepy old man cut it off.
- It looks good.
- Thanks.
Where are we? How's Nat?
- Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?
- Banner, listen.
- What?
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.
What are you saying?
What?
I've been Hulk for two years?
I'm afraid so.
What the hell happened?
Banner, there's something
you should know.
Voice activation required.
Banner.
Welcome, strongest Avenger.
What?
Ship's log.
Thor, where are we?
Yeah, about that.
Sakaar, hear ye.
Attention please. I have some bad news.
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.
Who's that?
He kind of runs the place.
You actually lived at his house
for awhile.
- I did?
- Yeah.
Quite a lot's happened.
You and I had a fight recently.
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.
Doesn't sound right.
Well, it's true.
It seems that that criminally seductive
Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.
Oh, no.
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.
No, no, no.
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.
These are Tony's clothes.
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?
No, he's not here.
But listen. Just stay calm, okay?
The sun's going down. The sun's getting
really low. Sun's going down.
I'm upset!
I'm very upset.
You know what I like about being upset?
The blame.
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in.
And you know who I'm blaming?
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!
Don't interrupt me!
Here you go.
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?
He was interrupting.
That's not a capital violation.
Where was I?
My precious champion
has come up missing,
and it's all because of that
Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.
Your brother.
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated, or you know.
I'm sure there's a big history.
And your contender...
My dear friend,
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could
bring them both back to you. Alive.
I could do it in two.
I could do it in one.
Let's stop there.
You know what? I woke up this morning
thinking about a public execution.
But for now,
I'll settle for this sweet little
"Who's gonna get him first?"
So, you're on the clock.
What have you done?
I don't answer to you, lackey.
It's Loki.
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.
Why would you help my brother escape
with that green fool?
I don't help anyone.
You're a Valkyrie.
I thought the Valkyrie had all died
gruesome deaths.
Choose your next words wisely.
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.
The sun's going down.
It's getting real low.
Oh, shoot.
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?
I just need you to stay calm.
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!
It's just a planet.
You've been on a planet before.
Yeah. One.
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.
It's a new experience.
My neurons, they're firing faster
than my brain can handle the information.
The whole thing
is totally different this time.
In the past, I always felt like Hulk
and I each had a hand on the wheel.
But this time, it's like he had the keys
to the car and I was locked in the trunk.
All right, well, you're back now.
That's all that matters.
No, it's not what matters.
What I'm trying to tell you, is that
if I turn into the Hulk again,
Banner may never come back.
And we're stranded on a planet
that is designed to stress me out.
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out
a way to get us home.
Thank you.
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.
What?
Listen, my people are in great danger.
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being,
who also happens to be my sister.
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...
I don't wanna fight your sister.
That's a family issue.
No, she's an evil being.
I don't care what she is.
I'm not fighting any more beings.
I'm sick of it.
- What?
- I just told you.
If I turn into the Hulk,
I am never gonna come back again.
And you don't care.
No, no. I'm putting together the team.
The Hulk is the fire.
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.
- What? No!
- It's gross.
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.
No! I don't even like the Hulk.
He's all like...
"Smash, smash, smash."
I prefer you.
Thanks.
But if I'm being honest,
when it comes to fighting evil beings,
he is very powerful and useful.
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
Is he though?
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.
How many PhDs does Banner have?
Seven.
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.
What are you doing with that?
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?
Because you were naked.
Okay, I'll give you that.
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!
Tony wears his pants super tight.
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.
Maybe the fact that I was trapped
for two years
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.
Hey. It's okay.
You're good. Calm down. Come on.
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard
and you're not gonna have to think about
the Hulk ever again. All right?
All right.
This is bad.
Banner! Banner!
Banner!
Banner!
Thor!
Hi.
Hi.
I was gonna do that.
Yeah, well, I did it first.
That's good. What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.
I got sidetracked.
What's with the...
It's my disguise.
But I can see your face.
Not when I do this, you can't.
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did
with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?
What are those things on her eyes?
Are those people that she's killed?
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.
Who is this guy?
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too.
Look, I've spent years in a haze,
trying to forget my past.
Sakaar seemed like the best place
to drink and forget, and to die one day.
I was thinking that you drink too much,
and that probably was gonna kill you.
I don't plan to stop drinking.
But I don't wanna forget.
I can't turn away anymore,
so if I'm gonna die,
well, it may as well be driving my sword
through the heart of that murderous hag.
- Good.
- Yeah.
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.
Has it got a name?
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.
Revengers?
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.
Do you want revenge?
I'm undecided.
Okay.
Also, I've got a peace offering.
Surprise.
Just had to be sure.
Hello, Bruce.
So, last time I saw you,
you were trying to kill everybody.
Where are you at these days?
It varies from moment to moment.
Is that a Dragonfang?
It is.
My God.
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far
apart as any two known systems.
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.
Nope. We are going through the big one.
The Devil's Anus?
Anus?
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?
For the record, I didn't know
it was called that when I picked it.
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
We need another ship.
That will tear mine to pieces.
She's right. We need one that can
withstand the geodetic strain
from the singularity.
And has an offline
power steering system
that could also function
without the on board computer.
And we need one with cup holders,
because we're gonna die. So, drinks!
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.
What do you say?
Uncharted metagalactic travel
through a volatile cosmic gateway.
Talk about an adventure.
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.
There are one or two ships.
Absolute top of the line models...
I don't mean to impose...
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.
I may even have stolen the access codes
to his security system.
And suddenly you're overcome
with an urge to do the right thing.
Heavens, no.
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster,
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship,
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.
You're telling us that you can get us
access into the garage
without setting off any alarms?
Yes, brother. I can.
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.
He did try to kill me.
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.
There was one time
when we were children,
he transformed himself into a snake,
and he knows that I love snakes.
So, I went to pick up the snake
to admire it,
and he transformed back into himself
and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.
If we're boosting a ship
we're gonna need to draw some guards
away from the palace.
Why not set the beast loose?
Shut up.
You guys have a beast?
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.
We're going to start a revolution.
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.
Is that some sort of protoplasm,
all the stuff that's coming out of you,
or are they eggs?
Looks like eggs.
I'm looking for Korg.
Who's asking?
I know you're asking.
Is there anyone else asking,
or is it just you?
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.
The revolution has begun.
Revolution? How did this happen?
Don't know.
But the arena's mainframe for the
Obedience Disks have been deactivated
and the slaves have armed themselves.
I don't like that word.
Which? Mainframe?
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?
No, the "S" word.
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.
Okay, that's better.
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.
I disagree.
Open communication
was never our family's forte.
You have no idea.
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.
Hello.
Hi.
Odin brought us together.
It's almost poetic that his death
should split us apart.
We might as well be strangers now.
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.
Here's the thing.
I'm probably better off staying here
on Sakaar.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Did you just agree with me?
Come on, this place is perfect for you.
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...
Brother, you're gonna do great here.
Do you truly think so little of me?
Loki, I thought the world of you.
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.
I don't know,
maybe there's still good in you.
But let's be honest,
our paths diverged a long time ago.
Yeah.
It's probably for the best
that we never see each other again.
It's what you always wanted.
Hey, let's do "Get Help."
- What?
- "Get Help."
No.
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.
- It's great. It works every time.
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?
- No.
We're doing it.
We are not doing "Get Help."
Get help! Please!
My brother, he's dying.
Get help! Help him!
Classic.
Still hate it.
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?
The Commodore.
Right.
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.
Loki.
I know I've betrayed you many times
before,
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.
The reward for your capture
will set me up nicely.
Never one for sentiment, were you?
Easier to let it burn.
I agree.
That looks painful.
Dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.
I trust you, you betray me.
Round and round in circles we go.
See, Loki, life is about...
It's about growth.
It's about change.
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief,
but you could be more.
I'll just put this over here for you.
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.
All right, I can figure this out.
It's just another spaceship.
Loyal Sakaarians,
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship
and my favorite champion.
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.
Do not let him leave this planet.
- Good shot!
- Thanks.
Open the doors.
Okay.
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.
Why?
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?
Yes, we should.
Where are the guns on this ship?
There aren't any.
- It's a leisure vessel.
- What?
Grandmaster uses it for his good times,
orgies and stuff.
Did she just say the Grandmaster
uses it for orgies?
Yeah.
Don't touch anything.
No!
- No!
- No!
Get inside!
In a minute.
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!
Okay, come on.
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.
That looks like a gun.
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
Yeah!
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!
There she is.
Our ticket out of here.
Hey, what's this?
Thank you.
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.
You wanna come?
You do seem like you're
in desperate need of leadership.
Why, thank you.
Here we go.
Shit.
Asgardians...
Some misguided soul
has stolen the Bifrost sword.
Tell us where it is
or there will be consequences.
Bad ones.
Well?
You.
Well? Executioner?
Wait!
Wait!
I know where the sword is.
I never thought I'd be back here.
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.
I mean, not that it's not nice.
It's just, it's on fire.
Here, up here in the mountains.
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.
She's coming for them.
Okay, drop me off at the palace
and I'll draw her away.
And get yourself killed?
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you
two to help get everyone off Asgard.
How the hell are we supposed to do that?
I have a man on the ground.
Asgard.
She's here.
Now the ship has a gun.
I'll take it from here.
I found this in the armory.
Good luck.
Your Majesty...
Don't die.
You know what I mean.
We must keep moving!
Go to the Bifrost!
Sister.
You're still alive.
I love what you've done with the place.
Redecorating, I see.
It seems our father's solution
to every problem was to cover it up.
Or to cast it out.
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.
You see?
You never knew him.
Not at his best.
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations
in blood and tears.
Where do you think all this gold
came from?
And then, one day,
he decided to become a benevolent king.
To foster peace, to protect life.
To have you.
I understand why you're angry.
And you are my sister, and technically
have a claim to the throne.
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.
But it can't be you.
You're just the worst.
Okay, get up.
You're in my seat.
You know, Father once told me
that a wise king never seeks out war.
But must always be ready for it.
Go back!
Go!
To be honest, I expected more.
Heimdall!
The sword!
Here's the difference between us.
I'm Odin's firstborn,
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.
And you're nothing.
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.
Now you remind me of Dad.
The stupid dog won't die!
Everything's gonna be all right now.
I got this.
You wanted to know who I am?
What the hell are you talking about?
You'll see!
You see? No one's going anywhere.
I'll get that sword,
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.
Hey, man.
I'm Korg. This is Miek.
We're gonna jump on that spaceship
and get out of here. Wanna come?
Your savior is here.
Did you miss me?
Everyone, on that ship now.
Welcome home. I saw you coming.
Of course you did.
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.
You see...
I'm not a queen or a monster.
I'm the Goddess of Death.
What were you the god of, again?
Even when you had two eyes,
you'd see only half the picture.
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?
That hammer was to help you
control your power, to focus it.
It was never your source of strength.
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.
Asgard is not a place. Never was.
This could be Asgard.
Asgard is where our people stand.
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.
I'm not as strong as you.
No...
You're stronger.
Tell me, brother.
What were you the god of, again?
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.
This isn't over.
I think we should disband the Revengers.
Hit her with a lightning blast.
I just hit her with the biggest lightning
blast in the history of lightning.
It did nothing.
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.
It won't end there.
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.
She'll hunt us down.
We need to stop her here and now.
So what do we do?
I'm not doing "Get Help."
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.
Loki,
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.
This was about causing Ragnarok.
Surtur's crown, the vault.
It's the only way.
Bold move, brother.
Even for me.
Shall we?
After you.
This is madness.
Go! Go, now!
For Asgard.
Hela!
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
Hela, enough!
You want Asgard, it's yours.
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.
You can't defeat me.
No, I know.
But he can.
No.
Tremble before me, Asgard!
I am your reckoning!
The people are safe.
That's all that matters.
We're fulfilling the prophecy.
I hate this prophecy.
So do I, but we have no choice.
Surtur destroys Asgard,
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.
But we need to let him finish the job,
otherwise...
No!
Hulk, stop, you moron!
Hulk, stop.
Just for once in your life, don't smash.
Big monster!
Let's go!
Fine.
I am Asgard's doom!
The damage is not too bad.
As long as the foundations
are still strong,
we can rebuild this place.
It will become a haven
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.
What have I done?
You saved us from extinction.
Asgard is not a place...
It's a people.
It suits you.
Maybe you're not so bad after all,
brother.
Maybe not.
Thank you.
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.
I'm here.
Your throne.
So, King of Asgard.
Where to?
I'm not sure.
Any suggestions?
Miek, where are you from?
Miek's dead.
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him
on the bridge.
I've just felt so guilty,
I've been carrying him around all day.
Miek, you're alive!
He's alive, guys.
What was your question again, bro?
Earth it is.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to go back to Earth?
Yes, of course. The people of Earth
love me. I'm very popular.
Let me rephrase that.
Do you really think it's a good idea
to bring me back to Earth?
Probably not, to be honest.
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like
everything's gonna work out fine.
Oh, boy.
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.
Come on. No?
Me too.
'Cause I've been a big part of it.
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.
So, you're welcome.
And it's a tie.

Things are never gonna be
the same now.
I mean, look at this.
You got aliens.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.
Yeah. Tell you what, though.
It ain't bad, is it?
No. Yeah.
Kid's got a future.
Yeah, well...
...we'll see, I guess.
No, hey!
You can't saw through that stuff.
These alien bastards are tough.
You gotta use the stuff they use.
- See? All right.
- All right.
Oh, hey!
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.
Look, just go stack
that armor plating like I asked you.
This is a huge deal for us.
Attention, please!
In accordance
with Executive Order 396B...
...all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
Qualified personnel.
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so-
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under ou rjurisdiction.
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected...
...or you will be prosecuted.
Ma'am, what am-- ?
Please. Come here.
Hey, lady, come on.
Look...
...I bought trucks for this job.
I brought in a whole new crew.
These guys have a family.
I have a family.
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
Maybe next time,
don't overextend yourself.
What'd you say?
Yeah.
He's right. I overextended myself.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.
Put them down.
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?
A joint venture between Stark Industries
and the government...
...the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection...
...and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.
Yeah, it's all rigged.
Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material...
...scattered throughout the tri-state area.
Hey, chief!
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?
I ain't hauling it.
It's too bad.
We could have made some cool stuff
from all that alien junk.
I tell you what.
Let's keep it.
The world's changing.
It's time we change, too.
There you go, Mason.
Business is good.
New York. Queens.
- t's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.
- Who you talking to?
No one. Just making
a little video of the trip.
- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.
Then why are you narrating
in that voice?
- Because it's fun.
- Fun.
So why do they call you Happy?
Come on.
I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.
Hey, should I go
to the bathroom before?
There's a bathroom on it.
No pilot? That's awesome.
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.
This is your first time
on a private plane?
My first time on any plane.
Should it-- ? Should it be-- ?
Should it be making that noise?
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.
Something about
Captain America going crazy.
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?
We're not roommates. Suit up.
Okay, Peter, you got this.
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's my suit.
- Where's the case?
- What case?
What? I thought that was a closet.
- This is still my room?
- Go.
- My room is way bigger than--
- There.
I found the case. I found the case.
"A minor upgrade"?
Oh, my God.
- Put it on.
- What the-- ?
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen--
- Let's go.
- But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.
This is insane. Insane.
Look at this thing.
Look. Look at the eyes.
- This is the greatest day of my life.
- Let's go.
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.
Hey, everyone.
The craziest thing just happened.
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him--
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"
And then-- Hey, just a second!
coming!
L- ley-
We have thin walls here.
What are you doing, a little video diary?
- Yeah.
- It's all right.
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to.
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
- Okay.
Hey. You know what?
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.
Three, two, one. Hey, May.
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what
an incredible job your nephew did...
...this weekend
at the Stark internship retreat.
Everyone was impressed.
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.
This is because you're not
on Queens Boulevard.
See, Happy is hoping to get
bumped up to asset management.
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.
That was a private conversation.
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard to talk about that.
- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line.
- Can you give us a moment?
- Want me to leave?
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.
I can keep the suit?
Yes, we were just talking about it.
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.
Don't stress him out.
Don't do anything stupid.
I've seen his cardiogram.
- All right?
- Yes.
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
There's a little gray area in there.
That's where you operate.
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.
- This it?
- Seventh floor.
- I can take that. You don't have to.
- You'll take it?
- Yeah, I can take that.
- Thank you.
So when's our next-- ?
When's our next "retreat," you know?
- What, next mission?
- Yeah, the mission. The missions.
- We'll call you.
- Do you have my numbers?
No, I mean, we'll call you.
Like, someone will call you. All right?
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.
Bye.
They're gonna call me.
What's up, Penis Parker?
Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.
Don't forget
about your homecoming tickets.
Do you have a date for homecoming?
Thanks, Jason,
but I already have a date.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Damn it. You, in my office right now.
Join me, and together...
...we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.
- What?
- So lame.
That's awesome. How many pieces?
Three thousand eight hundred and three.
- That's insane.
- I know. You want to build it tonight?
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark--
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.
Always got that internship.
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?
He'd be all, "Good job
on those spreadsheets, Peter.
Here's a gold coin."
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it.
The top half we can knock out
in two hours, tops.
That'd be great.
I'm gonna be late.
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration...
...between points A and B?
Flash.
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.
Nope. Peter. You still with us?
Yeah, yeah.
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.
You're dead.
Today we're talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...
...but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing...
...about his discoveries
regarding quantum theory.
Did Liz get a new top?
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.
Too late.
You guys are losers.
Well, then why do you sit with us?
Because I don't have any friends.
Next question.
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?
Hydrogen's the lightest.
That's not the question. Okay.
- Yeah.
- Uranium.
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.
- Yes.
- Please open your books to page 10.
Peter, it's nationals.
Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.
You've never been
in the same room as Tony Stark.
Wait. What's happening?
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No.
- No, no, no.
- Why not?
Really? Right before nationals?
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.
Flash, you're in for Peter.
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.
I got a hot date
with Black Widow coming up.
That is false.
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Delmar?
Hey, Mr. Parker.
Number five, right?
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you
smush it down real flat? Thanks.
You got it, boss.
How's your aunt?
Yeah, she's all right.
She's a very hot Italian woman.
How's your daughter?
- Ten dollars.
- It's 5 dollars.
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.
Here's 5 dollars.
What's up, Murph?
How you doing, buddy?
So how's school?
It's boring. Got better things to do.
Stay in school, kid.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.
Finally.
- What's the matter with you?
- Could you hold this?
Thanks.
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.
Does anyone have a pen?
Do you have a pen?
Everybody good?
Hey!
You're that spider guy
on YouTube, right?
Call me Spider-Man.
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.
- Yeah!
- Not bad.
Hey, buddy.
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumb-ass!
Hey! Shut that off!
- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was--
- I work at nights. Come on.
- That's not your car!
- That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know?
- He was putting that in the window!
- Every day with these alarms!
- Turn it off!
- Don't make me come down there, punk.
Hey, Gary. How you doing?
Marjorie, how are you?
How's your mother?
I'm good, I'm good.
You have reached
the voice-mail box of:
Happy Hogan.
Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.
Couldn't find the owner,
so I just left a note.
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.
She was really nice
and bought me a churro.
I just feel like I could be doing more.
You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.
So, yeah, just call me back.
It's Peter. Parker.
Why would I tell him about the churro?
Hey, hey-
Okay.
- Can't wait to see this thing.
- Finally, something good.
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.
Oh, nice.
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?
You're the Avengers.
What are you guys doing here?
Thor. Hulk.
Good to finally meet you guys.
I thought you'd be more handsome
in person. Iron Man.
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.
Hey"
Oh, this feels so weird.
What is that thing?
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.
911. What's your emergency?
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.
Let's wrap this up. It's a school night.
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?
No. Wait, wait, wait!
Mr. Delmar.
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?
ls anybody in here? Hello?
Oh, come on.
I gotta--
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.
Okay. Good. Yes.
Yes-- No. No, put that down.
That's worth more
than you or me. Yeah?
The craziest thing just happened.
These guys were robbing an ATM...
- ...with high-tech weapons--
- Take a breath. I don't have time...
- ...for ATM robberies...
- Yeah, but--
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.
Everything's gotta be out next week.
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?
Tony sold Avengers Tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate...
- ...where hopefully cell service is worse.
- But what about me?
What about you?
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?
- Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?
- Stay away from anything dangerous.
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?
I am responsible. I-- Oh, crap.
- My backpack's gone.
- That doesn't sound responsible.
- I'll call you back.
- Feel free not to.
What was that?
It's nothing. Nothing.
You're the Spider-Man.
- From YouTube.
- I'm not. I'm not.
- You were on the ceiling.
- No. What are you doing in my room?
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.
You can't just bust into my room!
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.
Let's go to dinner.
Thai? Ned, you want Thai?
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.
A thing to do after.
Okay.
Maybe put on some clothes.
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.
Mr. Stark knows
because he made my suit. That's it.
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?
Yeah, basically.
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.
Come on, Ned, please.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.
It's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I-- Please.
- Okay.
- Just swear it, okay?
I swear.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
I can't believe this is happening now.
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.
How's it work? Magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.
Okay, well, wait, then.
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?
This is the Stark internship.
Just get out of here.
What's the matter?
Thought you loved larb.
It's too larby?
Not larby enough.
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?
You know I larb you.
I'm just stressed.
The internship, and I'm tired.
A lot of work.
The Stark internship.
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.
- Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...
- What does he have you doing?
- ...in an explosion...
- You need to use your instincts.
...after an ATM robbery was thwarted
by Queens' own crime stopper...
What?
...the Spider-Man.
As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist...
...a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.
Miraculously, no one was harmed.
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Six blocks away from us.
I need a new backpack.
- What?
- I need a new backpack.
That's five.
- Sticky rice pudding.
- We didn't order that.
It's on the house.
Thanks.
That's nice of him.
I think he larbs you.
You got bit by a spider?
Can it bite me?
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?
Whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.
Maybe. How much did it hurt?
The spider's dead, Ned.
You were here?
Yeah.
You could've died.
Do you lay eggs?
What? No.
- Can you spit venom?
- No.
Can you summon an army of spiders?
No, Ned.
The Sokovia Accords were put
into place...
How far can you shoot your webs?
It's unknown. Shut up.
-- To begin regulating...
If I was you,
I would stand on a building...
- ...and just shoot it as far as I could--
- Shut up, Ned.
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.
...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.
- I stole his shield.
- What?
Today, my good friend,
your gym teacher...
...will conduct
the Captain America Fitness Challenge.
Thank you, Captain.
Pretty sure he's a war criminal,
but I have to show these videos.
It's required by the state. Let's do it.
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?
What does Hulk smell like?
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?
Ned, just...okay?
- Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
- What?
Yeah. You know how there's a guy
with a headset...
...telling the other guy where t0 go?
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.
- I could be your guy in the chair.
- I don't need a guy in the chair.
Looking good, Parker.
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor...
...marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.
Well, what about the Spider-Man?
It's just Spider-Man.
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.
Oh, my God,
she's crushing on Spider-Man.
No way.
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.
- He's probably 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.
Like, what if he's seriously burned?
I wouldn't care. I'd love him
for the person he is inside.
Peter knows Spider-Man.
No, I don't. No. I-- I mean--
They're friends.
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.
But it's...
...through the Stark internship.
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.
Well, that's awesome.
Hey, you know what?
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.
It's okay.
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?
What are you doing?
Helping you out.
Did you not hear her?
Liz has a crush on you.
Dude, you're an Avenger.
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.
House party in the suburbs.
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.
It'll be a night to remember.
Ned, some hats wear men.
You wear that hat.
Yeah, it gives me confidence.
This is a mistake.
Hey, let's just go home.
Oh, Peter.
I know. I know it's really hard...
...trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.
It's flowering now.
He's so stressed out lately.
What helps with stress is a party.
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.
Peter.
- Have fun, okay? Okay.
- I will.
Bye, May.
Dude, you have the suit, right?
- Yeah.
- This is gonna change our lives.
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.
L- ley-
DJ Flash.
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in...
...say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.
Can't believe you're at this lame party.
But you're here too.
Am w.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.
I'm so happy you guys came.
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
- What a great party.
- Thanks.
Oh, I--
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta--
- Yeah.
- Have fun.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Dude, what are you doing?
She's here. Spider it up.
No, no, no. I can't-- I cannot do this.
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.
Peter, no one wants that.
Dude.
Penis Parker, what's up?
So where's your pal Spider-Man?
Let me guess: In Canada
with your imaginary girlfriend?
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.
Oh, what's up, Ned?
Hey, where's Peter, anyways?
He must be around..."
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?
What the hell?
This sucks.
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.
Here. You try.
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?
Okay, okay.
I got what you need, all right?
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...
You letting off shots
in public now? Hurry up.
Look, times are changing. We're the only
ones selling these high-tech weapons.
This must be where
the ATM robbers got their stuff.
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.
I got antigrav climbers.
Yo, climbers?
Okay, what the hell is that?
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot
at somebody, shoot at me.
All right.
What was that?
- We gotta call him.
- No, no, no.
Did you just do it again?
- Shut up.
- I'm calling him.
Toomes's phone.
Boss.
Oh, my butt!
Great. Guess I'm gonna have
to take a shortcut.
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.
Hey, hey, buddy.
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.
Now, this is more like it.
Smells really good.
Great movie!
Oh, hey, guys.
NO! No!
Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.
Peter, where are you?
The hat's not working. This is not cool.
Almost got you.
Thought you got away from me,
didn't you?
I got you right where I want you.
Surprise!
What the hell?
Oh, hey.
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster...
...and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?
I put everything in your suit.
Including this heater.
That's better. Thanks.
What were you thinking?
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.
Take him down now, huh?
Crockett, there are people
who handle this son of thing.
- The Avengers?
- No. This is a little below their pay grade.
Mr. Stark, you didn't have
to come out here.
I had that. I was fine.
Oh, I'm not here.
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...
...or you would be toast right now.
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.
Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.
- Why?
- Why?
Because I said so!
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.
Stay close to the ground.
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.
Can't you just be a friendly...
...neighborhood Spider-Man?
But I'm ready for more than that now.
No, you're not.
That's not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.
Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.
Are you driving?
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.
I got some pull at MIT. End call.
No, I don't need to go to--
Mr. Stark is no longer connected.
That's awesome.
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."
- Penis!
- Parker!
- Penis!
- Parker!
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
Idiots.
Idiots.
Idiots!
Boss?
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.
What'd I tell you about
looking at my phone?
Sorry. You left it out.
You know
I'm a curious person by nature.
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?
You're still on that? I told you, no.
The answer's no. Forget it.
I mean, that was badass.
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?
- You said, move the merchandise.
- Under the radar.
Under the radar!
That's how we survive.
If you bring Damage Control
or the Avengers down here, we're through.
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars...
...calling yourself the Shocker.
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?
Whatever, old man. Come on.
Look.
Look.
I know you don't give a crap
about anything.
But I do.
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I can't afford your bullshit.
- Get out of here.
- What?
- You're done. You're off the crew.
- Yeah, all right.
All right.
Wonder if you can afford me
out there, though, right?
With everything I know.
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying...
...maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.
- You know what?
- What?
You're right.
- That work?
- I don't know.
I can't afford that.
Wait.
Damn.
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?
No, that's that one.
Here.
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there
and find that weapon he lost.
All right.
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.
Yeah, well, something came up.
What is that?
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
Awesome.
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.
So scary.
Well, look, I think it's...
...a power source.
Yeah, but it's connected
to all these microprocessors.
That's an inductive charging plate. That's
what I use to charge my toothbrush.
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey...
...into this amazing--
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.
We'll go to the lab after class
and run tests.
Let's do it.
First, we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.
We gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy."
You're right.
Crap.
Come on, come on, come on.
High schools creep me out.
They got this funny smell, you know?
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.
What?
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.
- Peter--
- No. Stay there, Ned.
Peter.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Yeah. You good?
Chess.
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?
It's saying there was
an energy pulse here.
There's no sign of the weapon.
- And even if it was here, now it's gone.
- So are we.
This is so awesome.
I know, right?
They're in Brooklyn.
Staten Island.
Leaving Jersey.
They stopped.
Maryland?
- What's there?
- I don't know.
Evil lair?
- They have a lair?
- A gang with alien guns...
...run by a guy with wings? Yeah.
Badass.
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?
It's not too far from D.C.
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.
No, no way. You can't quit on us...
...stroll up and be welcomed back
by everyone.
Hey, welcome back!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.
- What?
- He's taking your place.
Excuse me, can we go already?
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.
Focus up.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.
The second law of thermodynamics.
- Frank Sinatra.
- Fort Sumter.
- Flash is wrong.
- Okay, let's focus. Next one.
Liz, don't overwork them.
Strontium, barium, vibranium.
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.
Glad to be back.
- What is the current standard unit of-- ?
- Can I take this real quick?
Yeah, fine.
- Hello?
- Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker.
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.
Happy, I gotta say,
tracking me without permission...
...is a complete violation of privacy.
- That's different.
- What's different?
Nothing. Look, it's just
the Academic Decathlon.
- It's no big deal.
- Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.
You kidding me? This place is huge.
- I've seen bigger.
- There's a bird in here.
- Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
- Why?
Peter...
...why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?
I gotta follow these guys to their boss
before they move again...
...and I don't really want Mr. Stark
to know about it.
So you're lying to Iron Man now?
No, I'm not lying.
He just doesn't really get
what I can do yet.
Gotcha.
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.
There's a ton
of other subsystems in here...
...but they're all disabled
by the Training Wheels Protocol.
What?
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.
Come on, man,
I don't need training wheels.
I'm sick of him treating me
like a kid all the time.
- t's not cool.
- But you are a kid.
A kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.
I mean, what if this is illegal?
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.
I can handle it. Ned, come on.
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- The guy in the chair.
- Don't do that.
- Come on.
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe.
- All right?
- Okay. Okay.
- They're moving.
- Be careful.
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.
We're gonna go swimming.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.
L- ley-
I was-- I was gonna go study
in the business center.
You don't need to.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.
And besides...
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so--
I-- I heard it in a TED Talk.
And I read a coaching book.
You really--
This is really important to you.
Yeah. It's our future.
I'm not gonna screw it up.
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
Let's go.
- Good evening, Peter.
- Hello? Hello?
Congratulations on completing
the Training Wheels Protocol...
...and gaining access
to your suit's full capabilities.
Thank you.
Where would you like
to take me tonight?
I put a tracker on someone.
He's a bad guy.
Tracker located.
Plotting course to intercept target.
As long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.
One hundred meters
from destination and closing.
Jump now.
Detecting three individuals.
Why is their secret lair
in a gas station? That's so lame.
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?
Do you want to hear
what they're saying?
I can hear what they're saying? Yeah.
Activating Enhanced
Reconnaissance Mode.
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design.
Whoa, that's so cool.
Can't believe they're still cleaning up
that Triskelion mess.
I love it. They keep making messes...
- ...we keep getting rich.
- Target inbound.
They're in the middle of a heist.
I could catch them red-handed.
This is awesome.
Okay, I'll get closer
to see what's happening.
Would you like me
to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?
"Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.
Activating instant Kill.
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.
Deactivating Instant Kill.
Did you hear that?
What the hell just happened?
What was that?
You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.
What's wrong with my web-shooters?
Rapid-fire is the default
for Enhanced Combat Mode.
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
- Would you like to see more options?
You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.
Mr. Stark really overdid it.
You two wait right here.
Wait. You're gonna want
to turn on the dampers.
- That thing will shatter your arm.
- All right, where's the dampers?
- That one.
- Great choice.
Would you like me to set this
as your new default?
No, no, no.
- Push that in. No, the other--
- Here? This one here?
- What was that?
- Taser webs.
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.
You seem to be unfamiliar
with your web-shooter settings.
Would you like to run
a refresher course?
- No. Just-- You choose.
- Sure thing.
Six-alpha-niner,
are you running on time?
Copy, central.
Six-alpha-niner on schedule.
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.
Oh, that's him.
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.
Pulling in behind the caboose.
Deploy anchors.
Dropping down.
No outgoing distress signals.
You're clear.
Hey. Looks like they got
some good stuff here.
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.
All right, coming up.
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.
Oh, God.
- Suit lady, what was that?!
- You told me to choose.
What? No, just set everything
back to normal.
Activating all systems.
My head.
You appear to have a mild concussion.
Hey, so where am I right now?
I'm not sure.
The container walls are hindering
my sensors.
Wait a minute.
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have
to fight our way out of this one.
Three, two, one.
What is this place?
Suit lady, where am I?
You're in the most secure facility
on the eastern seaboard.
The Damage Control deep storage vault.
No. Seriously?
The door will most likely remain closed
until morning.
Morning?
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?
I think I should probably give you a name.
Like Liz. No, no, no.
God, that's-- That's weird.
What about Karen?
You can call me Karen
if you would like.
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?
What?
Maybe we should run
that refresher course.
- Ricochet web.
- Ricochet web.
- Cool.
- Splitter web.
- Web grenade.
- Web grenade!
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?
Who is Liz?
Who's Liz? She's--
She's the best. She's awesome.
She's just a girl who goes to my school.
And--
Yeah, I just-- I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."
What's weird about that?
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?
Imagine how disappointed
she'd be when she sees me.
Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.
Thanks, Karen.
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.
Hey, how long we been here anyways?
- Thirty-seven minutes-
- What?!
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.
I cannot take this anymore.
I got t0-- I gotta get out of here.
There's got t0 be something in here
I can use.
Okay, let's see.
Nope.
That's awesome.
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.
That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.
You mean, we've been
carrying around a bomb?
t would require radiation
to transform it into an explosive state.
No, no, no.
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.
Trial unsuccessful.
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.
Okay. Hold on, hold on.
Initiating trial 247.
It worked. It works.
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.
Thank you.
Karen, get me to decathlon
as fast as possible.
Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
Across the street
from the Washington Monument.
- It's Ned. Leave a message.
- Call me back. The glowy thing's a bomb!
There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.
We have now entered sudden death.
The next correct answer wins
the championship.
Midtown Tech?
Zero.
That is correct.
Midtown takes the championship.
- We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.
- Told you we didn't need Peter.
- Flash, you didn't answer a question.
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just--
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by--
Okay.
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?
Where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?
- t's safe. It's in my backpack.
- Ned, listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.
- Listen.
- We're at the Washington Monument.
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.
- Is that Liz?
- Put Ned back on the phone.
- You should tell her how you feel.
- You flake. You are lucky we won.
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?
I have to talk to Ned. It's important.
- All items on the belt, please.
- There's something in Ned's backpack.
It's dangerous.
Don't let it go through x-ray.
Liz? Liz! Damn it.
Can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?
The Chitauri core has detonated...
...and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.
What? Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Oh, my God, that's tall.
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.
Just stay calm, everyone.
Oh, we are all going to die here.
Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.
We're freaking screwed.
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.
The safety systems
are completely failing.
We're very safe in here.
The occupants are
in imminent mortal danger.
Going as fast as I can!
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.
You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.
What?! Why?
Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.
- How do I get in there?
- Activating reconnaissance drone.
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.
Locating optimal entry point.
Proceed to southwest window.
Karen, I'm on my way.
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Okay. Oh, my God.
Okay.
What's wrong? You've reached
the southwest window.
- Why are you hesitating?
- It's fine.
I've just never been this high before.
You have also not reinstalled
your parachute...
...so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.
Perfect.
Oh, my God.
Why is it not breaking?
It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.
My friends are in there! Stop!
Return to the ground immediately.
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.
Stand down!
Return to the ground immediately.
Return to the ground
or we will open fire!
Go up, 90 UP-
I got this.
Take my trophy.
This is your last chance.
I'm gonna die.
Break!
I did it.
Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry. I got you.
- Yes! Yes.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Big guy, quit moving around.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Let's go, let's go!
Okay, Okay-
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.
- This is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.
Liz!
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay.
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.
Come on up.
Come on, you guys, stay back.
- Come on in.
- You guys good?
So is everyone okay?
This is your chance, Peter.
Kiss her.
Thank you.
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck...
Yeah, damn it.
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?
Yeah, but then that's it.
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.
No.
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those...
...Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in Stark Tower.
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.
Really?
I'm gonna kill him.
- I'm gonna find him--
- Found him.
The Spider-Man swooped in...
...heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.
The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.
Peter. Come here,
come here, come here.
This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team...
...defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.
Later that day,
they also defeated death.
Explosion. Salty scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.
There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.
As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.
I couldn't bear to lose
a student on a school trip.
Not again.
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.
How can you show your spider spirit?
Dude, dude, dude.
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.
- Should we tell everyone?
- No.
- Should I tell everyone?
- No, dude. That's not a good idea.
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
- I'm not going to class.
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.
Dude, listen, I figured it out.
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.
What he takes from Damage Control,
that's how he builds the weapons.
- So all I gotta do is catch him.
- But we have a Spanish quiz.
Ned, I'm probably never gonna
come back here.
Mr. Stark is moving
the Avengers upstate...
- ...so when I bring this guy in--
- Dude.
You want to be a high school dropout?
I am so far beyond high school right now.
Parker, my office.
So...
...you got detention.
You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.
The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?
Maybe you were trying to be cool.
But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years...
...the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.
We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.
Next time those turkeys try
to convince you of something...
- ...you know is wrong...
- Where you going? Get back here.
...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?
Why are you here?
You don't have detention.
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.
It's you.
So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.
May?
Hey, Karen. What's up?
Hey, Peter.
How was your Spanish quiz?
I was wondering if you could help me.
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night...
...but I can only remember
part of a license plate.
I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.
- Footage?
- Yes, Peter.
I record everything you see.
- Everything?
- Everything.
- All the time?
- It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.
Yeah, of course it is.
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
- With pleasure.
Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.
Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.
No, no, no.
This is just me messing around.
Go later in the day, later in the day.
It is I, Thor, son of Odin.
No, no, no. That's definitely--
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.
- Your impressions are very funny.
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.
Okay.
- The two on the right, who are they?
- Searching law enforcement databases.
No records found
for two of the individuals.
Nothing'?
- One individual identified.
Aaron Davis, age 33.
He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.
Let's pay him a visit.
Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?
Yeah.
- Remember me?
- Hey--
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.
- All right, chill.
- Come on!
- What happened to your voice?
- What do you mean?
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a-- I'm a man.
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl--
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?
I need to know. Give me names or else.
- You ain't ever done this before, huh?
- Deactivate Interrogation Mode.
Look, man.
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.
They can't be out on the streets.
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half--
- You know Delmar's?
- Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.
- Sub Haven's pretty good.
- It's too much bread.
- I like bread.
- Come on, man, please.
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.
The other night, you told that dude,
"if you shoot somebody, shoot me."
That's pretty ballsy.
I don't want those weapons
in this neighborhood.
I got a nephew who live here.
Who are these guys?
What can you tell me
about the guy with the wings?
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.
I don't know who he is
or where he is.
- I do know where he's gonna be.
- Really?
Yeah, this crazy dude
I used to work with...
...he's supposed
to be doing a deal with him.
Yes! Yes.
- Thank--
- Hey. Hey. Hey.
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just--
Yeah.
- Where is it?
- Can I give you some advice?
You got to get better
at this part of the job.
I don't understand.
I'm intimidating.
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.
No, no, no. Come fix this.
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.
Nice.
Okay, Karen, activate
Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.
Sure thing.
He's up front, main deck.
I hate this guy.
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?
Just keep me posted.
There's no record of him
in my criminal database.
Incoming call from May Parker. Should
I reroute to your heads-up display?
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.
- Who's the guy on the left?
- Mac Gargan.
Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.
Would you like me
to activate Instant Kill?
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.
White pickup truck.
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.
Oh, this is too perfect.
I got the weapons, buyers
and sellers in one place.
- Incoming call from Tony Stark.
- No, no, no.
Don't answer.
- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
- I'm actually at school.
- No, you're not.
- Nice work in D. C.
- Okay.
My dad never really gave me
a lot of support...
...and I'm trying to break
the cycle of shame.
I'm in the middle of something.
Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.
Anyway, great things are about to-
What is that?
I'm at band practice.
That's odd. Happy told me you quit
band six weeks ago. What's up?
- I gotta go. End call.
- Hey.
I'll take those!
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry
was at 10:30. You missed it.
Spider guy's here.
Not so fast.
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.
I got to say, the other guy was way better
with that thing.
I'm honestly--
I'm-- I'm shocked.
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.
What do you mean, FBI?
- The Federal Bureau of Investigation.
- I know, but what are they doing here?
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!
No.
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.
We're getting out of here.
Activate Taser web!
You're messing with things
you don't understand.
Oh, my God. What do I do? Karen...
...give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.
Web grenade. Web grenade.
Splitter web, go.
Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.
- Ninety-eight?
- Yeah, Spider-Man!
No, no, no.
What the hell?
What the hell?
Hi, Spider-Man.
Band practice, was it?
Yeah, Iron Man!
Mr. Stark.
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?
I think you've done enough.
So that's it. You're just gonna run?
Feds were waiting for us.
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?
Yeah, I'm running.
You should too.
You know I can't do that.
So now what?
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?
Seriously?
Yes. You will not regret this.
You in?
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch...
.../ tell you to stay away from this.
Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit...
...so you could sneak around
behind my back...
...doing the one thing
I told you not to do.
ls everyone okay?
No thanks to you.
No thanks to me?
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it...
...but you didn't listen.
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid.
- I'm 15.
- No, this is where you zip it, all right?
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.
And if you died...
...I feel like that's on me.
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry. I understand.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.
I just wanted to be like you.
And I wanted you to be better.
It's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.
- For how long?
- Forever.
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.
- Let's have it.
- Please, this is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Okay?
God, I sound like my dad.
I don't have any other clothes.
Okay, we'll sort that out.
L- ley-
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.
You can't do that.
Then this ferry thing happens.
I've called five police stations.
Five.
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.
Cut the bullshit.
I know you left detention.
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.
I know you sneak out
of this house every night.
That's not fine.
Peter, you have to tell me
what's going on. Just lay it out.
It's just me and you.
I lost the Stark internship.
- What?
- Yeah.
What happened?
I just thought that I could work really hard
and he could-- He would-- You know.
But I screwed it up.
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry I made you worry.
I'm not trying to ruin your life.
Yeah, I know.
Just--
- I used to sneak out too.
- Yeah.
And take a shower. You smell.
You smell like garbage.
I know.
Peter, you're a good kid
and you're a smart kid...
...so just try to keep
your head straight, okay?
Okay.
All right, get out of here.
Are you expelled?
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.
You're so lucky.
L- ley-
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.
Hey, look, I--
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.
It's fine.
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.
No, I'm--
I just mean that...
...it was not cool, especially...
...because...
...I like you.
I know.
You do?
You're terrible at keeping secrets.
Yeah, you'd be surprised.
I got to get to class, but--
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...
...forever, but--
I guess you already have a date
to homecoming.
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so--
Do you want to...
...go with me?
Yeah. Sure.
Really? I mean, great. Cool.
Cool.
I'm actually going that way.
May, I need your help.
Through or around?
Right?
It's game day. So, what's the plan?
Open the door for her.
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.
- Don't be creepy.
- No.
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.
I got this.
- Love you.
- Bye.
You must be Peter.
Yeah.
I'm Liz's dad.
Put her there.
Hell of a grip.
Come on in here. Come on.
Hi, Peter.
You look very handsome.
Thank you.
You got his name right?
- Freddie?
- Peter.
Peter. Peter.
I'm gonna go get Liz.
Okay.
You all right, Pete?
Yeah.
Because you look pale.
You want something to drink?
A bourbon or a Scotch,
or something like that?
I'm not old enough to drink.
That's the right answer.
- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.
Doesn't she, Pete?
Yeah, you look really good.
Once again, that's the right answer.
Is that a corsage?
Thanks.
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.
Okay. Come on, you guys.
Peter, closer.
Smile.
There you go.
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.
I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.
- He's always going. Have fun.
- Last time.
- Thank you.
- Promise.
He's cute.
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.
Come on, Pedro.
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.
- What are you gonna do, Pete?
- What?
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.
Just saying, you know.
All you guys who go to that school...
...you pretty much have
your life planned out, right?
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.
Really? Stark?
So cool.
What do you do?
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, it got...
...boring.
It was boring?
You got to hang outwith Spider-Man.
Really? Spider-Man?
What's he like?
Yeah, he's nice.
Nice man.
Solid dude.
Look. So cute.
I've seen you around, right? I mean...
...somewhere. We've-- Have we ever-- ?
Because even the voice--
He does Academic Decathlon with me.
And he was at my party.
It was a great party, really great, yeah.
- Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
- You were there for, like, two seconds.
That was-- I was there longer
than two seconds.
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.
That's terrible what happened
down there in D.C. though.
Were you scared?
I'll bet you were glad
when your old pal Spider-Man...
...showed up in the elevator though, huh?
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.
I saw it all from the ground.
Yeah.
Very lucky that he was there that day.
Good old Spider-Man.
Dad, the light.
Here we are. End of the line.
Thanks, Dad.
You head in there, gumdrop.
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.
Don't let him intimidate you.
Love you.
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.
Hi.
You guys look so pretty.
Does she know?
Know what?
So she doesn't. Good.
Close t0 the vest.
I admire that.
I've got a few secrets of my own.
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...
Peter...
...nothing is more important than family.
You saved my daughter's life.
I could never forget something like that.
So I'm gonna give you one chance.
Are you ready?
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...
...and don't you ever, ever...
...interfere with my business again.
Because if you do...
...I'll kill you...
...and everybody you love.
I'll kill you dead.
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?
L- ley-
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now you go on in there and you show
my daughter a good time, okay?
Just not too good.
L- ley-
What did he say to you?
Gotta go.
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this.
He gave you a choice.
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?
What's with the crappy costume?
My web-shooters.
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but damn.
Gross.
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.
Nice shot!
Yes!
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.
Get a computer and track my phone.
- Will you be okay?
- Hurry, we gotta catch him...
...before he leaves town.
I'm sorry about dinner...
...but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay? So--
Flash, I need your car and phone.
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't--
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?
- Go for Ned.
- Ned, I need you...
- ...to track my phone.
- Yeah, but where is it?
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.
- You stole Flash's car. Awesome.
- Yeah, it's awesome. it's--
Get out of the way,
get out of the way! Move!
Are you okay'?
- I've never driven before...
...only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.
Hey, have you gotten through
to Happy yet?
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
Guy in the chair.
Takeoff in nine minutes.
Hello? Hello? Who Is this?
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
- Who?
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you--
You gotta be shitting me.
Damn.
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?
Round knob to the left
of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.
Left, okay.
Okay, perfect.
So where's my phone now?
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.
What? That makes no sense.
He said he was going out of town.
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.
It sounded like he was catching a flight.
He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.
- What?
- He was surrounded by boxes.
Boxes? It's moving day.
It's moving day.
He's gonna rob that plane.
I gotta stop him!
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster Armor...
...prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging--
The Meg-- The--
Thor's magic belt.
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.
- What?
- Turn right.
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.
What are you doing here?
There's a dance.
I'm...
...looking...
...at porn.
Hey!
Surprised?
Oh, hey, Pete.
I didn't hear you come in.
It's over. I've got you.
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete...
...I really, really admire your grit.
I see why Liz likes you.
I do. When you first came to the house...
...I wasn't sure.
I thought, "Really?" But I get it now.
How could you do this to her?
To her?
I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.
I'm doing this for her.
Yeah.
Peter...
...you're young.
You don't understand
how the world works.
But I understand that selling weapons
to criminals is wrong.
How do you think
your buddy Stark paid for that tower?
Or any of his little toys?
Those people, Pete,
those people up there...
...the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.
Guys like us...
...like you and me...
...they don't care about us.
We build their roads,
and we fight all their wars...
...and everything,
but they don't care about us.
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.
That's how it is.
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to understand.
And...
...I needed a little time
to get her airborne.
I'm sorry, Peter.
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.
True. Then again...
...wasn't really trying to.
Chief, they're powering up engines.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, ready?
Hello?
Hello!
Please, hey.
Hey, please. I'm down here.
I'm down here. I'm stuck.
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't--
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Come on, Peter.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man.
Come on, Spider-Man!
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.
Oh, yeah.
Retroreflective panels engaged.
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.
It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.
Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.
This better work, Mason.
Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life.
Yeah.
You have 30 seconds
to get to the cockpit...
...and override their security.
Cloning transponder signal.
Launching decoy drone.
Entering new coordinates.
Good, so it's on its way.
- Yes, sir, right on course.
- Okay, thank you.
All right.
Hot dog.
Just a typical homecoming...
...on the outside of an invisible jet...
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.
Oh, God!
I can't believe that worked.
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.
I'm not going home empty-handed.
Oh, my God.
- Get out of there. What are you doing?
- Please turn, please turn!
Hey, Pedro.
Bingo.
Your wingsuit.
Your wingsuit's going to explode!
Time to go home, Pete.
I'm trying to save you!
No.
No.
It looked so insane. That whole--
Like, it was just crazy.
He-- He was just, like...
And you were like...
And then I just hit him with the...
It was so-- Oh, my God.
I mean, you saved me.
It was awesome.
Hey, Liz.
I'm gonna miss you.
Bye.
Liz.
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?
The dance?
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.
Well, yeah, but I--
I mean, your dad-- I can't imagine
what you're going through.
If there's anything I can do to help...
I guess we're moving to Oregon.
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So...
Liz, I-- I--
Bye, Peter.
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.
Congratulations,
decathlon national champions.
Yeah!
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon...
...but just for motivation right now
at this practice.
I'm ahead of the game,
but we will need...
...a new team captain next year.
So I am appointing Michelle.
Yeah!
Thank you.
My-- My friends call me MJ.
I thought you didn't have any friends.
I didn't.
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?
What are you hiding, Peter?
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.
Hey, Happy. What-- ?
What are you doing here?
I really owe you one.
I don't know what I would do
without this job.
I mean, before I met Tony--
So how long you been here?
Long enough to be awkward.
Boss wants to see you.
- Is he here too?
- In the toilet? No, he's upstate.
Upstate-- Like, upstate-upstate?
Yeah, let's go.
Take a look.
It's pretty impressive, huh?
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.
- You don't see that every day.
- Oh, there they are.
How was the ride up?
- Good.
- Give me a minute with the kid.
- Seriously?
- Yeah.
I gotta talk to the kid.
I'll be close behind.
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.
Sorry I took your suit.
You had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was...
...the perfect tough-love moment
that you needed.
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.
- Mr. Stark, I really--
- You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.
But then you did the right thing.
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...
All right, not my best analogy.
I was wrong about you.
I think, with a little more mentoring...
...you could be a real asset to the team.
- To the-- ? To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway...
...there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.
When you're ready...
...why don't you try that on?
And I'll introduce the world to the newest
official member of the Avengers:
Spider-Man.
'Can-
Yeah, give that a look.
After the press conference,
Happy will show you to your room...
...your new quarters.
Where's he between?
He's next to Vision?
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.
Or walls.
You'll fit right in.
Thank you, Mr. Stark.
But I'm good.
You're good? Good-- ?
How are you good?
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?
You're turning me down?
You better think about this.
Look at that.
Look at me.
Last chance. Yes or no?
- No.
- Okay.
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.
Happy will take you home.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Mind waiting in the car?
I need a minute.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.
- See you around.
- Okay.
That was a test, right?
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
Yeah, thank you.
Told you he's a good kid.
- Where's the kid?
- He left.
- Everybody's waiting.
- He actually made a mature choice.
- It just surprised the heck out of us.
- Did you screw this up?
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding?
I have a room full of people
in there waiting...
...for some big announcement.
What will I tell them?
Think of something. How about...?
- Hap, you still got that ring?
- Do I-- ? I-- ?
- The engagement ring.
- Are you kidding?
I've been carrying this since 2008.
Okay.
I think I can think
of something better than that.
Well, it would buy us a little time.
Like we need time.
I can't believe you have that
in your pocket.
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?
May?
What 'the-l?!
Look who it is.
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?
Relax.
This? It's not on you.
It's on our little spider friend.
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.
And I heard a rumor.
You know who he is.
If I knew who he was...
...he'd already be dead.
Toomes, your family's here!
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you...
...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.
Patience.
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.
Sometimes it leads to very little...
...and it seems like it's not worth it.
And you wonder...
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.
How many more of these?

This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel Statesman.
We are under assault.
I repeat,
we are under assault.
The engines are dead,
life support failing.
Requesting aid
from any vessel within range.
We are 22 jump points
out of Asgard.
Our crew is made up
of Asgardian families.
We have
very few soldiers here.
This is not a warcraft.
I repeat,
this is not a warcraft.
Hear me and rejoice.
You have had the privilege
of being saved
by the Great Titan.
You may think
this is suffering.
No.
It is salvation.
Universal scales
tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice.
Smile.
For even in death,
you have become
Children of Thanos.
I know what it's like to lose.
To feel so desperately
that you're right...
yet to fail, nonetheless.
It's frightening.
Turns the legs to jelly.
But I ask you, to what end?
Dread it, run from it...
destiny arrives all the same.
And now, it's here.
Or should I say...
I am.
You talk too much.
The Tesseract.
Or your brother's head.
I assume you have
a preference.
Oh, I do.
Kill away.
All right, stop!
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.
You really are
the worst brother.
I assure you, brother...
the sun will shine
on us again.
Your optimism is misplaced,
Asgardian.
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.
And for another...
we have a Hulk.
Let him have his fun.
Allfathers...
let the dark magic flow
through me one last...
time.
That was a mistake.
No!
You're going to die for that.
Shh.
My humble personage...
bows before your grandeur.
No other being
has ever had the might...
nay, the nobility...
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.
The universe lies
within your grasp.
There are two more stones
on Earth.
Find them, my children,
and bring them to me on Titan.
Father,
we will not fail you.
If I might interject.
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.
I do have a bit of experience
in that arena.
If you consider
failure experience.
I consider
experience experience.
Almighty Thanos...
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...
Odinson...
the rightful king
of Jotunheim...
god of mischief...
do hereby pledge to you...
my undying fidelity.
Undying?
You should choose your words
more carefully.
You...
will never be...
a god.
No!
No resurrections this time.
No. Loki.
Seriously,
you don't have any money?
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.
I'll tell the guys
at the deli.
Maybe they'll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye.
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.
I think I have 200.
Dollars?
- Rupees.
- Which is?
Uh, buck and a half.
What do you want?
I wouldn't say no
to a tuna melt.
Thanos is coming.
He's coming.
Who?
Slow down, slow down.
I'll spell it out for you.
You're totally rambling.
- No, I'm not.
- You lost me.
Look, you know how
you're having a dream,
and in the dream
you gotta pee.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God.
"There's no bathrooms.
What am I gonna do?
- "Oh, someone's watching."
- Right.
"Oh, I'm gonna
go in my pants."
And then you wake up
and in real life
you actually have to pee.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Everybody has that.
Right, that's the point
I'm trying to make.
Apropos of that, last night
I dreamt we had a kid.
It was so real.
We named him
after your eccentric uncle.
Uh, what was his name?
- Right.
- Morgan! Morgan.
- So you woke up...
- Naturally.
...and thought that we were...
- Expecting.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- No.
I had a dream about it.
It was so real.
If you wanted to have a kid...
you wouldn't have done that.
I'm glad you brought this up,
'cause it's nothing.
It's just a housing unit
for nanoparticles.
You're not helping
your case, okay?
No, this is detachable.
It's not a...
You don't need that.
I know, I had the surgery.
I'm just
trying to protect us...
and future usses
and that's it.
Just in case there's a monster
in the closet.
- Instead of, you know...
- Shirts.
You know me so well.
- God.
- You finish all my sentences.
You should have shirts
in your closet.
Yeah.
You know what there should be?
No more surprises.
We're gonna have
a nice dinner tonight.
Show off this Harry Winston.
Right? And we should have
no more surprises. Ever.
I should promise you.
- Yes.
- I will.
Thank you.
Tony Stark.
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.
Oh, uh, congratulations
on the wedding, by the way.
I'm sorry, you giving out
tickets to something?
We need your help.
It's not overselling it
to say that
the fate of the universe
is at stake.
And who's "we"?
Hey, Tony.
Bruce.
- Pepper.
- Hi.
- Oh.
- You okay?
At the dawn
of the universe,
there was nothing. Then...
Boom.
The Big Bang sent
six elemental crystals...
hurtling across
the virgin universe.
These Infinity Stones
each control an essential
aspect of existence.
Space.
Reality.
Power.
Soul.
Mind.
And Time.
Tell me his name again.
Thanos.
He's a plague, Tony.
He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.
He wipes out
half the population.
He sent Loki.
The attack on New York,
that's him.
This is it.
What's our timeline?
No telling. He has
the Power and Space Stones.
That already makes him
the strongest creature
in the whole universe.
If he gets his hands
on all six stones, Tony...
He could destroy life
on a scale
hitherto undreamt of.
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto undreamt of"?
Are you seriously leaning
on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Is that what it is?
I'm going to allow that.
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just
stick this one down
a garbage disposal?
No can do.
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.
And I swore off dairy...
but then Ben & Jerry's named
a flavor after me.
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- Not bad.
A bit chalky.
A Hunk of Hulk of
Burning Fudge is our favorite.
- That's a thing?
- Whatever.
Point is, things change.
Our oath to protect
the Time Stone cannot change.
And this stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.
Yeah, so conversely,
it may also be
his best chance against us.
Well, if we don't do our jobs.
What is your job exactly?
Besides making
balloon animals.
Protecting your reality,
douchebag.
Okay, guys. Could we table
this discussion right now?
The fact is
we have this stone.
We know where it is.
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone...
and we have to find him now.
Yeah, that's the thing.
What do you mean?
Two weeks ago, Vision turned
off his transponder.
He's offline.
- What?
- Yeah.
Tony, you lost
another super-bot?
I didn't lose him. He's more
than that. He's evolving.
Who could find Vision then?
Shit.
Probably Steve Rogers.
Oh, great.
Maybe.
But...
Call him.
It's not that easy.
God, we haven't caught up
in a spell, have we?
No.
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.
Broke up?
Like a band?
Like... Like the Beatles?
Cap and I fell out hard.
We're not on speaking terms.
Tony, listen to me.
Thor's gone.
Thanos is coming.
It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.
Flip phone.
Say, Doc, you wouldn't
happen to be
moving your hair, would ya?
Not at the moment, no.
You okay?
- Help him!
- Banner!
- Wong! Look alive!
- Go, go! We got it!
Friday, what am I looking at?
Not sure.
I'm working on it.
Hey! You might wanna
put that Time Stone
in your back pocket, Doc!
Might wanna use it.
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.
Holy shit.
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God!
What's the matter
with you kids?
You never seen
a spaceship before?
Friday, evac anyone
south of 43rd Street.
Notify first responders.
Will do.
Hear me and rejoice.
You are about to die
at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.
Be thankful...
that your meaningless lives
are now contributing...
I'm sorry,
Earth is closed today.
You better pack it up
and get outta here.
Stonekeeper.
Does this chattering animal
speak for you?
Certainly not.
I speak for myself.
You're trespassing in
this city and on this planet.
He means get lost, Squidward.
He exhausts me.
Bring me the stone.
Banner, you want a piece?
Mmm, no, not really.
But when do I ever get
what I want?
That's right.
Okay. Push!
It's been a while.
It's gonna be good
to have you, buddy.
Okay. Shh.
Let me just... I need to
concentrate here for a second.
Come on, come on, man.
God!
Where's your guy?
I don't know. We've sorta
been having a thing.
- It's no time for a thing.
- I know.
That's the thing right there.
Let's go.
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.
Tony, I'm sorry.
Either I can't or he won't.
It's okay.
Hey, stand down.
Keep an eye on him. Thank you.
- I have him.
- Damn it.
Where'd that come from?
It's nanotech.
You like it?
A little something I...
Doctor Banner, if the rest
of your green friend
won't be joining us...
Gotta get that stone
outta here, now.
It stays with me.
Exactly. Bye.
Tony, you okay?
- How we doing? Good? Bad?
- Really, really good.
Really good.
Do you plan on helping out?
I'm trying. He won't come out.
Hammer.
Come on, Hulk!
What are you doing to me?
Come out! Come out! Come out!
No!
What do you mean, "no"?
Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?
- A field trip to MoMA.
Uh, what is this guy's
problem, Mr. Stark?
Uh, he's from space.
He came here to steal
a necklace from a wizard.
Your powers are quaint.
You must be popular
with children.
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.
You'll find removing a
dead man's spell troublesome.
You'll only wish
you were dead.
No!
Kid,
that's the wizard. Get on it.
On it!
Not cool.
Gotcha!
Wait!
Uh, Mr. Stark,
I'm being beamed up.
Hang on, kid.
Oh!
Ugh.
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.
Give me a little juice,
Friday.
Unlock 17:A.
Pete, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.
But you said
save the wizard!
I can't breathe.
We're too high up.
You're running out of air.
Yeah. That makes sense.
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here!
Happy trails, kid.
- Friday, send him home.
- Yep.
Oh, come on!
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.
Tony? Oh, my God.
Are you all right?
What's going on?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just think
we might have to push
our 8:30 res.
Why?
Just 'cause
I'll probably
not make it back for a while.
Tell me
you're not on that ship.
Yeah.
God, no, please tell me
you're not on the ship.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.
Come back here, Tony.
I swear to God.
- Pep.
- Come back here right now.
Come back.
Boss,
we're losing her.
I'm going too.
Oh, my God!
I shoulda stayed on the bus.
Where you going?
The Time Stone's been taken.
The Sanctum remains unguarded.
What will you do?
I'm gonna make a call.
Sing it, Drax!
Why are we doing this again?
It's a distress signal,
Rocket.
Someone could be dying.
I get that,
but why are we doing it?
'Cause we're nice.
And maybe whoever it is
will give us a little
cheddar cheese for our effort.
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point.
I mean,
if he doesn't pony up...
We take his ship.
- Exactly!
- Bingo!
All right!
We are arriving.
All right, Guardians,
don't forget
this might be dangerous...
so let's put on
our mean faces.
Groot, put that
thing away, now.
I don't wanna tell you again.
Groot.
I am Groot!
- Whoa!
- Language!
- Hey!
- Wow.
You got some
acorns on you, kid.
Ever since
you got a little sap,
you're a total d-hole.
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces.
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Looks like
we're not getting paid.
Wipers! Wipers!
Get it off.
How the hell
is this dude still alive?
He is not a dude.
You're a dude.
This... This is a man.
A handsome, muscular man.
I'm muscular.
But who are you
kidding, Quill?
You're one sandwich
away from fat.
Yeah, right.
It's true, Quill.
You have put on weight.
What?
Gamora, do you think I'm...
He is anxious, angry.
He feels
tremendous loss and guilt.
It's like a pirate had a baby
with an angel.
Wow.
This is a real wake-up call
for me. Okay.
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
You know you can't
eat dumbbells, right?
It's like his muscles
are made
of Cotati metal fibers.
Stop massaging his muscles.
Wake him up.
Wake.
Who the hell are you guys?
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal.
To bring balance
to the universe
by wiping out
half of all life.
He used to kill people
planet by planet,
massacre by massacre.
Including my own.
If he gets
all six Infinity Stones...
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this.
You seem to know
a great deal about Thanos.
Gamora
is the daughter of Thanos.
Your father killed my brother.
Oh, boy.
Stepfather, technically.
And she hates him
as much as you do.
Families can be tough.
Before my father died,
he told me
that I had a half-sister...
that he imprisoned in Hel.
And then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye.
So I had to kill her.
That's life though,
isn't it, I guess.
Goes round and round and...
I feel your pain.
I feel your pain as well,
because...
I mean,
it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.
My father killed my mother.
And then I had to kill
my father.
That was hard.
Probably even harder
than having to kill a sister.
Plus, I came out with
both my eyes, which was...
I need a hammer, not a spoon.
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of, uh...
A four-digit code, maybe?
Maybe a birthdate.
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Taking your pod.
No, you're not.
You will not be taking
our pod today, sir.
Uh... Quill, are you making
your voice deeper?
- No.
- You are.
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.
No, I'm not.
- He just did it again!
- This is my voice.
Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?
- Stop it. You did it again.
He's trying to copy me.
I need you to stop doing that.
- Enough!
- He's doing it first.
We need to stop Thanos.
Which means
we need to find out
where he's going next.
Knowhere.
He must be going somewhere.
No, no. Knowhere?
It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.
- Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.
Thor, why would he
go to Knowhere?
Because for years...
the Reality Stone's been
safely stored there
with a man
called the Collector.
If it's with the
Collector, then it's not safe.
Only an idiot
would give that man a stone.
- Or a genius.
- How do you know...
he's not going
for one of the other stones?
There are six stones
out there.
Thanos already has
the Power Stone...
because he stole it last week
when he decimated Xandar.
He stole the Space Stone
from me...
when he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.
The Time and Mind Stones
are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.
- The Avengers?
- Earth's mightiest heroes.
Like Kevin Bacon?
He may be on the team.
I don't know.
I haven't been there
in a while.
As for the Soul Stone, well,
no one's ever seen that.
No one even knows where it is.
Therefore Thanos can't get it.
Therefore he's going
to Knowhere.
Hence he'll be getting
the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.
Then we have to go
to Knowhere now.
Wrong. Where we have to go
is Nidavellir.
- That's a made-up word.
- All words are made up.
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?
That place is a legend.
They make the most powerful,
horrific weapons
to ever torment the universe.
I would very much like
to go there, please.
The rabbit is correct
and clearly the smartest
among you.
Rabbit?
Only Eitri the Dwarf can
make me the weapon I need.
I assume
you're the captain, sir.
You're very perceptive.
You seem like a noble leader.
Will you join me
on my quest to Nidavellir?
Let me just ask the captain.
Oh, wait a second, it's me!
- Yeah. I'll go.
- Wonderful!
Uh, except for that
I'm the captain.
Quiet.
- That's my backpack.
- Go sit down.
Look, this is my ship.
And I'm not goin' to...
Wait, what kinda weapon
are we talkin' about here?
The Thanos-killing kind.
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?
No. You simply lack
the strength to wield them.
Your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed
into madness.
Is it weird that I wanna do it
even more now?
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.
If we don't go to Knowhere
and Thanos retrieves
another stone...
he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.
- I got it figured out.
We got two ships
and a large assortment
of morons.
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate angel here.
And the morons
will go to Knowhere
to try to stop Thanos.
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.
For the record...
I know that
you're going with him
because it's where
Thanos isn't.
You know, you really shouldn't
talk that way
to your captain, Quill.
Come on, Groot.
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.
I bid you farewell
and good luck, morons.
Bye.
Vis?
Is it the stone again?
It's as if
it's speaking to me.
What does it say?
I don't... I don't know,
but something.
Hey.
Tell me what you feel.
I just feel you.
So there's a 10:00 a.m.
to Glasgow...
which would give us more time
together before you went back.
What if
I miss that train?
There's an 11:00.
What if I missed
all the trains?
What if this time
I didn't go back?
But you gave Stark your word.
I'd rather give it to you.
Well, there are people who are
expecting me too, you know.
We both made promises.
Not to each other.
Wanda.
For two years,
we've stolen these moments...
trying to see
if this could work and...
I don't know.
You know what, I'm just
gonna speak for myself.
I think...
- It works.
- It works.
It works.
Stay.
Stay with me.
Or not. If I'm overstepping...
What are they?
What the stone
was warning me about.
I have to go.
No, Vision.
Vision, if that's true,
then maybe
going isn't the best idea.
Wanda, I...
Vision!
The blade,
it stopped me from phasing.
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.
My systems are failing.
I'm beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed.
Vis!
Give up the stone,
and she lives.
Hands off.
Come on. Come on.
Come on, you gotta get up.
You gotta get up.
Come on. Hey.
Hey. We have to go.
Please. Please leave.
You asked me to stay.
- I'm staying.
- Please.
- Get up.
- I can't.
We don't wanna kill you,
but we will.
You'll never get
the chance again.
Can you stand?
Thank you, Captain.
Let's get you on the jet.
Now, I thought we had a deal.
Stay close, check in,
don't take any chances.
I'm sorry.
We just wanted time.
Where to, Cap?
Home.
We'll be safe.
We'll be safe.
Zehobereians.
Mother! Where's my mother?
Choose a side or die.
Mother!
One side
is a revelation...
the other an honor
known only to a few.
What's wrong, little one?
My mother. Where is my mother?
What's your name?
Gamora.
You're quite the fighter,
Gamora.
Come.
Let me help you.
Look.
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced,
as all things should be.
Too much to one side
or the other...
Here. You try.
Now, go in peace
to meet your maker.
Uh-uh.
Concentrate.
There. You've got it.
Gamora.
Do you know if these grenades
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind?
Because I was thinking about
hanging a couple
on my belt right here.
But I don't want to
if they're the...
I need to ask a favor.
Yeah, sure.
One way or another,
the path that we're on
leads to Thanos.
Which is what
the grenades are for.
Uh, I'm sorry.
What's the favor?
If things go wrong...
If Thanos gets me...
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.
What?
I know something he doesn't.
And if he finds it out,
the entire universe
could be at risk.
What do you know?
If I tell you, you'd know too.
If it's so important...
shouldn't I?
Only if you wanna die.
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?
Just...
Trust me.
And possibly kill me.
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would. But you...
Swear to me.
Swear to me on your mother.
Okay.
Okay.
- Oh.
- Dude.
How long have you been
standing there?
An hour.
An hour?
Are you serious?
I've mastered the ability
of standing
so incredibly still...
that I become
invisible to the eye.
Watch.
You're eating a zarg-nut.
But my movement...
was so slow...
that it's imperceptible.
Mmm, no.
I'm sure I'm invisible.
Hi, Drax.
Damn it.
This place looks deserted.
I'm reading movement
in the third quadrant.
Yep,
I'm picking that up too.
Let's put down right here.
I don't have it.
Everyone
in the galaxy knows
you'd sell your own brother...
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket...
to your pathetic collection.
I know you have
the Reality Stone, Tivan.
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.
I told you.
I sold it.
Why would I lie?
I imagine it's like
breathing for you.
Like suicide.
You do understand.
Not even you would surrender
something so precious.
I didn't know what it was.
Then you're more of a fool
than I took you for.
It's him.
Last chance,
charlatan.
Where's the stone?
Today...
Drax. Drax.
...he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.
Drax, wait.
Not yet, not yet, not yet.
Drax.
Drax, Drax, Drax.
Listen to me.
He doesn't have the stone yet.
If we get it,
then we can stop him.
We have to get
the stone first. Yeah.
No.
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.
Sleep.
Okay.
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.
The other right.
Why?
Why you, daughter?
That was quick.
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Magnificent!
Is that sadness
I sense in you, daughter?
In my heart,
I knew you still cared.
But one never knows for sure.
Reality is often
disappointing.
That is, it was.
Now...
reality can be
whatever I want.
You knew I'd come.
I counted on it.
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.
Thanos!
No!
Let her go, Grimace.
Peter.
I told you to go right.
Now? Really?
You let her go!
Ah, the boyfriend.
No.
Like to think of myself
more as a Titan-killing,
long-term booty call.
- Let her go.
- Peter.
I'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face.
Not him.
You promised. You promised.
Oh, daughter.
You expect too much from him.
She's asked, hasn't she?
Do it.
Mmm.
Do it!
I told you to go right.
I love you more than anything.
I love you too.
I like him.
Still no word from Vision?
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.
On a stolen Quinjet
with four of the world's
most wanted criminals.
You know they're
only criminals because
you've chosen to
call them that, right, sir?
My God, Rhodes.
Your talent for horseshit
rivals my own.
If it weren't
for those Accords,
Vision would've been
right here.
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.
That's right.
And I'm pretty sure
I paid for that.
You have second thoughts?
Not anymore.
Mr. Secretary.
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.
You could use
some of that right now.
The world's on fire.
And you think all is forgiven?
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.
And I'm way past
asking permission.
Earth just lost
her best defender.
So we're here to fight.
And if you wanna
stand in our way...
we'll fight you too.
Arrest them.
All over it.
That's a court-martial.
It's great to see you, Cap.
You too, Rhodey.
Hey.
Wow. You guys...
really look like crap.
Must've been
a rough couple years.
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.
Uh, I think
you look great.
Uh...
Yeah, I'm back.
Hi, Bruce.
Nat.
This is awkward.
So we gotta assume
they're coming back, right?
And they can clearly find us.
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?
After the whole
Accords situation,
he and Scott took a deal.
It was too tough
on their families.
They're on house arrest.
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?
Okay, look.
Thanos has the biggest army
in the universe...
and he is not gonna stop
until he gets...
Vision's stone.
Then we have to protect it.
No, we have to destroy it.
I've been giving
a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head.
About its nature.
But also its composition.
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source...
something very similar to
its own signature, perhaps...
its molecular integrity
could fail.
Yeah, and you with it.
We're not having
this conversation.
Eliminating the stone
is the only way
to be certain that
Thanos can't get it.
That's too high a price.
Only you have
the power to pay it.
Thanos threatens
half the universe.
One life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him.
But it should.
We don't trade lives, Vision.
Captain, 70 years ago,
you laid down your life...
to save how many
millions of people?
Tell me,
why is this any different?
Because you might
have a choice.
Your mind is made up
of a complex construct
of overlays.
Jarvis, Ultron,
Tony, me, the stone.
All of them mixed together,
all of them
learning from one another.
You're saying Vision isn't
just the stone?
I'm saying that
if we take out the stone...
there's still a whole lot
of Vision left.
Perhaps the best parts.
Can we do that?
Not me, not here.
Well,
you better find someone
and somewhere fast.
Ross isn't just gonna
let you guys
have your old rooms back.
I know somewhere.
The Kingsguard
and the Dora Milaje
have been alerted.
And the Border Tribe?
Those that are left.
Send word
to the Jabari as well.
M'Baku likes a good fight.
And what of this one?
This one may be tired of war.
But the White Wolf
has rested long enough.
Where's the fight?
On its way.
In all the time
I've served Thanos...
I have never failed him.
If I were to reach
our rendezvous on Titan...
with the Time Stone
still attached
to your vaguely
irritating person...
there would be judgment.
Give me...
the stone.
Wow, you're a seriously
loyal piece of outerwear,
aren't you?
Yeah, uh,
speaking of loyalty...
What the...
- I know what you're gonna say.
- You should not be here.
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it.
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought
- about you on the way...
- And now I gotta hear it.
...and kinda stuck to the side
of the ship.
And this suit is ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.
God damn it.
So, if anything, it's kinda
your fault that I'm here.
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.
And now, I'm here in space.
Yeah, right where
I didn't want you to be.
This isn't Coney Island.
This isn't a field trip.
This is a one-way ticket.
You hear me? Don't pretend
you thought this through.
No, I did think this through.
You could not have possibly
thought this through.
You can't be a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man...
if there's no neighborhood.
Okay, that didn't
really make sense,
but you know
what I'm trying to say.
Come on. We got a situation.
See him down there?
He's in trouble.
What's your plan?
- Go.
- Um...
Okay, okay... Uh...
Okay. Did you ever see
this really old movie, Aliens?
Painful, aren't they?
They were originally designed
for microsurgery.
And any one of them...
could end your friend's life
in an instant.
I gotta tell you,
he's not really my friend.
Saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy.
You've saved nothing.
Your powers
are inconsequential
compared to mine.
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.
Yes! Wait.
What are those?
Hey,
we haven't officially met.
Cool.
We gotta turn
this ship around.
Yeah, now he wants
to run. Great plan.
No, I want to protect
the stone.
And I want you
to thank me.
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.
For what?
Nearly blasting me into space?
Who just saved
your magical ass? Me.
I seriously don't know
how you fit your head
into that helmet.
Admit it, you should've
ducked out when I told you to.
I tried to bench you.
You refused.
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.
And due to that fact,
we're now
in a flying doughnut...
billions of miles from Earth
with no backup.
- I'm backup.
- No, you're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.
I'm sorry, I'm confused
as to the relationship here.
What is he, your ward?
No.
- I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.
Oh, you're using
our made-up names. Um...
I'm Spider-Man, then.
This ship is
self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.
Can we control it?
Fly us home?
- Stark?
- Yeah.
Can you get us home?
Yeah, I heard you.
I'm thinking I'm not
so sure we should.
Under no circumstances
can we bring
the Time Stone to Thanos.
I don't think
you quite understand
what's at stake here.
What? No. It's you
who doesn't understand...
that Thanos has been
inside my head for six years.
Since he sent an army
to New York
and now he's back.
And I don't know what to do.
So I'm not so sure
if it's a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his...
but you saw what they did,
what they can do.
At least on his turf,
he's not expecting it.
So I say we take
the fight to him.
Doctor.
Do you concur?
All right, Stark.
We go to him.
But you have to understand...
if it comes to saving you
or the kid
or the Time Stone...
I will not hesitate
to let either of you die.
I can't, because the universe
depends on it.
Nice. Good, moral compass.
We're straight.
All right, kid.
You're an Avenger now.
I thought
you might be hungry.
I always hated that chair.
So I've been told.
Even so, I'd hoped you'd
sit in it one day.
I hated this room.
This ship.
I hated my life.
You told me that too.
Every day.
For almost 20 years.
I was a child
when you took me.
I saved you.
No.
No. We were happy
on my home planet.
Going to bed hungry...
scrounging for scraps.
Your planet was
on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.
Do you know
what's happened since then?
The children born...
have known nothing but
full bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.
Because you murdered
half the planet.
A small price to pay
for salvation.
You're insane.
Little one,
it's a simple calculus.
This universe is finite,
its resources finite.
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.
It needs correction.
You don't know that!
I'm the only one
who knows that.
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.
For a time...
you had that same will...
as you fought by my side.
Daughter.
I'm not your daughter.
Everything I hate about myself
you taught me.
And, in doing so,
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy.
That's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
I am disappointed.
But not because
you didn't find it.
But because you did.
And you lied.
Nebula.
Don't do this.
Some time ago,
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me.
Please don't do this.
And very nearly succeeded.
So I brought her here.
To talk.
Stop. Stop it.
I swear to you on my life.
I never found the Soul Stone.
Accessing memory files.
You know
what he's about to do.
He's finally ready,
and he's going for the stones.
- All of them.
- He can never get them all.
He will!
He can't, Nebula.
Because I found the map
to the Soul Stone...
and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.
You're strong.
Me.
You're generous.
Me.
But I never taught you to lie.
That's why
you're so bad at it.
Where is the Soul Stone?
Vormir!
The stone is on Vormir.
Show me.
I am Groot.
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking.
What's there to see?
What's a twig? Everybody's
seen a twig before.
I am Groot.
Tree, pour what's in the cup
out into space
and go in the cup again.
You speak Groot?
Yes, they taught it on Asgard.
It was an elective.
I am Groot.
You'll know when we're close.
Nidavellir's forge harnesses
the blazing power
of a neutron star.
It's the birthplace
of my hammer.
It's truly awesome.
Okay, time to be the captain.
So, dead brother, huh?
Yeah, that could be annoying.
Well, he's been dead before.
But, no, this time I think
it really might be true.
And you said
your sister and your dad?
Both dead.
But still got a mom, though?
Killed by a dark elf.
A best friend?
Stabbed through the heart.
You sure you're up to this
particular murder mission?
Absolutely.
Rage and vengeance,
anger, loss, regret...
they're all
tremendous motivators.
They really clear the mind.
So I'm good to go.
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talkin' about...
he's the toughest there is.
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.
He's never fought me twice.
And I'm getting a new hammer,
don't forget.
It better be some hammer.
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.
I've killed twice
as many enemies as that.
And every one of them
would've rather killed me,
but none succeeded.
I'm only alive
because fate wants me alive.
Thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards...
and he'll be the latest
to feel my vengeance.
Fate wills it so.
Mmm-hmm.
And what if you're wrong?
If I'm wrong, then...
what more could I lose?
I could lose a lot.
Me, personally,
I could lose a lot.
Okay.
If fate does want you
to kill that crapsack...
you're gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?
- What's it look like?
Some jerk lost a bet with me
on Contraxia.
He gave you his eye?
No, he gave me 100 credits.
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.
Thank you, sweet rabbit.
Hmm.
Huh?
Oh.
I would've washed that.
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was up my...
Hey, we're here!
I don't think
this thing works.
Everything seems dark.
It ain't the eye.
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.
And the rings are frozen.
I hope
these dwarves are better
at forging
than they are cleaning.
Maybe they realized
that they live
in a junk pile
in the middle of space.
This forge hasn't gone dark
in centuries.
You said Thanos
had a gauntlet, right?
Yes, why?
It look
anything like that?
I am Groot.
Go back to the pod.
Eitri, wait!
Stop!
Stop.
Thor?
What happened here?
You were supposed
to protect us.
Asgard was supposed
to protect us.
Asgard is destroyed.
Eitri, the glove.
What did you do?
300 dwarves
lived on this ring.
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.
I made what he wanted.
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.
Then he killed
everyone anyway.
All except me.
"Your life is yours," he said.
"But your hands
are mine alone."
Eitri, this isn't about
your hands.
Every weapon
you've ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword...
it's all inside your head.
Now, I know it feels
like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.
But together, you and I,
we can kill Thanos.
Mantis, listen very carefully.
I need you
to meet me on Titan.
Hey, what's going on?
I think we're here.
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.
Get your hand
inside the steering gimbal.
Close those around it.
- You understand?
- Yep, got it.
This was meant for
one big guy, so we gotta
- move at the same time.
- Okay, okay. Ready.
We might wanna turn.
Turn! Turn! Turn!
You all right?
That was close.
I owe you one.
Let me just say, if aliens
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something...
and I eat one of you,
I'm sorry.
I do not want another
single pop culture reference
out of you for the rest
of the trip. You understand?
I'm trying to say
that something is coming.
Thanos!
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't
put your eggs in me!
Stay down, clown.
Die, blanket of death!
Everybody stay where
you are. Chill the eff out.
I'm gonna ask you
this one time.
Where is Gamora?
Yeah. I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?
I'll do you one better.
Why is Gamora?
Tell me where the girl is
or I swear to you
I'm gonna French fry
this little freak.
Let's do it. You shoot my guy
and I'll blast him. Let's go!
Do it, Quill! I can take it.
- No, he can't take it!
- She's right. You can't.
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell
me where she is? That's fine.
I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it
out of Thanos myself.
Starting with you.
Wait, what, Thanos?
All right, let me ask you
this one time.
What master do you serve?
What master do I serve?
What am I supposed to say,
"Jesus"?
You're from Earth.
I'm not from Earth,
I'm from Missouri.
Yeah, that's on Earth,
dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?
So you're not
with Thanos?
With Thanos?
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.
He took my girl.
Wait, who are you?
- We're the Avengers, man.
- Oh.
You're the ones
Thor told us about.
You know Thor?
Yeah.
Tall guy, not that
good-looking, needed saving.
Where is he now?
This is the plan? We're gonna
hit him with a brick?
It's a mold.
A king's weapon.
Meant to be
the greatest in Asgard.
In theory, it could even
summon the Bifrost.
Did it have a name?
Stormbreaker.
That's a bit much.
So how do we make it?
You'll have to restart
the forge.
Awaken the heart
of a dying star.
Rabbit, fire up the pod.
The hell happened
to this planet?
It's eight degrees
off its axis.
Gravitational pull
is all over the place.
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.
We'll use it.
All right, I have a plan.
Or at least
the beginnings of one.
It's pretty simple.
We draw him in,
pin him down,
get what we need.
Definitely don't wanna
dance with this guy.
We just want the gauntlet.
Are you yawning?
In the middle of this, while
I'm breaking it down? Huh?
Did you hear what I said?
I stopped listening after
you said, "We need a plan."
Okay, Mr. Clean
is on his own page.
See, "not winging it"
isn't really what they do.
Uh, what exactly
is it that they do?
Kick names, take ass.
Yeah, that's right.
All right, just get over here,
please.
Mr. Lord, can you get
your folks to circle up?
"Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine.
We gotta coalesce.
'Cause if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.
All right, we're optimistic,
yes. I like your plan.
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...
and that way
it might be really good.
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe.
- What dance-off?
- It's nothing.
Like in Footloose, the movie?
Exactly like Footloose.
Is it still the greatest movie
in history?
It never was.
Don't encourage this,
all right?
- Okay.
- We're getting no help
- from Flash Gordon here.
- Flash Gordon?
By the way,
that's a compliment.
Don't forget, I'm half human.
So that 50% of me
that's stupid...
that's 100% you.
Your math
is blowing my mind.
Excuse me.
But does your friend
often do that?
Strange, we all right?
You're back. You're all right.
- Hi.
- Hey, what was that?
I went forward in time
to view alternate futures.
To see all
the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict.
How many did you see?
14,000,605.
How many did we win?
One.
The stone
had better be up there.
For your sister's sake.
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
You know us?
It is my curse to know all
who journey here.
Where is the Soul Stone?
You should know...
it extracts a terrible price.
I am prepared.
We all think that at first.
We are all wrong.
How is it you know
this place so well?
A lifetime ago,
I, too, sought the stones.
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out,
banished me here.
Guiding others to a treasure
I cannot possess.
What you seek
lies in front of you.
As does what you fear.
What's this?
The price.
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.
You might say it has
a certain wisdom.
Tell me what it needs.
To ensure that
whoever possesses it...
understands its power...
the stone demands a sacrifice.
Of what?
In order to take the stone,
you must lose
that which you love.
A soul...
for a soul.
All my life,
I dreamed of a day...
a moment...
when you got
what you deserved.
And I was always
so disappointed.
But now...
You kill and torture...
and you call it mercy.
The universe has judged you.
You asked it for a prize,
and it told you no.
You failed.
And do you wanna know why?
Because you love nothing.
No one.
No.
Really?
Tears?
They're not for him.
No.
This isn't love.
I ignored my destiny once.
I cannot do that again.
Even for you.
I'm sorry, little one.
No!
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.
I hope you're right
about this.
Or we're gonna land
a lot faster than you want to.
When you said we were
going to open Wakanda
to the rest of the world...
this is not what I imagined.
And what did you imagine?
The Olympics.
Maybe even a Starbucks.
Should we bow?
Yeah, he's a king.
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.
What are you doing?
Uh, we don't do that here.
So how big of an assault
should we expect?
Uh, sir, I think you should
expect quite a big assault.
How we looking?
You will have my Kingsguard,
the Border Tribe,
the Dora Milaje, and...
And a semi-stable
100-year-old man.
How you been, Buck?
Uh, not bad,
for the end of the world.
Whoa.
The structure is polymorphic.
Right, we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially.
Why didn't you just reprogram
the synapses
to work collectively?
Because we didn't think of it.
I'm sure you did your best.
Can you do it?
Yes, but there are more than
two trillion neurons here.
One misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures.
It will take time, brother.
How long?
As long as you can give me.
Something's entered
the atmosphere.
Hey, Cap, we got
a situation here.
God, I love this place.
Yeah, don't
start celebrating yet, guys.
We got more incoming
outside the dome.
It's too late.
We need to destroy
the stone now.
Vision, get your ass
back on the table.
We will hold them off.
Wanda, as soon as that stone's
out of his head...
you blow it to hell.
I will.
Evacuate the city.
Engage all defenses.
And get this man a shield.
I don't think
you get the scientifics here.
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving...
you're gonna need something
a lot bigger
to yank 'em loose.
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?
Buddy, you're in space.
All you got is a rope and a...
Fire the engines!
More power, rabbit!
Well done, boy.
That's Nidavellir.
Damn it.
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?
The mechanism
is crippled.
- What?
- With the iris closed,
I can't heat the metal.
How long will it take
to heat it?
A few minutes,
maybe more. Why?
I'm gonna hold it open.
That's suicide.
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.
How we looking, Bruce?
Yeah, I think
I'm getting the hang of it.
Wow! This is amazing, man.
It's like being the Hulk
without actually...
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I've got two heat signatures
breaking through
the tree line.
Thank you
for standing with us.
Where's your other friend?
You will pay for his life
with yours.
Thanos will have that stone.
That's not gonna happen.
You are in Wakanda now.
Thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood.
We have blood to spare.
They surrender?
Not exactly.
What the hell?
Looks like we pissed her off.
They're killing themselves.
You see the teeth
on those things?
All right, back up, Sam.
You're gonna get
your wings singed.
Cap, if these things
circle the perimeter
and get in behind us...
there's nothing
between them and Vision.
Then we better keep 'em
in front of us.
How do we do that?
We open the barrier.
On my signal, open North-West
Section Seventeen.
Requesting
confirmation, My King.
You said open the barrier?
On my signal.
This will be
the end of Wakanda.
Then it will be
the noblest ending in history.
Wakanda forever!
Now!
How much longer, Shuri?
I've barely begun, brother.
You might want to pick up
the pace.
Allfathers, give me strength.
You understand, boy?
You're about to take
the full force of a star.
It'll kill you.
Only if I die.
Yes.
That's what killing you means.
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!
Thor! Say something. Come on.
Thor, you okay?
I think he's dying.
He needs the axe!
Where's the handle?
Tree, help me find the handle!
There's too many of 'em!
You guys
are so screwed now!
Bring me Thanos!
Oh, yeah.
You're much more of a Thanos.
I take it the Maw is dead.
This day
extracts a heavy toll.
Still, he accomplished
his mission.
You may regret that.
He brought you face-to-face
with the Master
of the Mystic Arts.
And where do you think
he brought you?
Let me guess. Your home?
It was.
And it was beautiful.
Titan was like most planets.
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.
Genocide.
But random, dispassionate,
fair to rich and poor alike.
They called me a madman.
And what I predicted
came to pass.
Congratulations,
you're a prophet.
I'm a survivor.
Who wants to murder trillions.
With all six stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.
And then what?
I'd finally rest...
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.
I think you'll find our will
equal to yours.
Our?
Piece of cake, Quill.
Yeah, if your goal
was to piss him off.
Boom!
Don't let him close his fist.
Magic.
More magic.
Magic with a kick.
Magic with a...
Insect!
Well, well.
You should've killed me.
It would've been
a waste of parts!
Where's Gamora?
Is he under?
Don't let up.
Be quick. He is very strong.
Parker, help! Get over here.
She can't hold him
much longer. Let's go.
We gotta open
his fingers to get it off.
I thought you'd be
hard to catch.
For the record,
this was my plan.
You're not so strong now, huh?
Where is Gamora?
My Gamora.
No, bullshit!
Where is she?
He is in anguish.
Good.
He... He mourns.
What does
this monster have to mourn?
Gamora.
What?
He took her to Vormir.
He came back
with the Soul Stone.
But she didn't.
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it
right now. You understand?
Don't, don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!
Tell me she's lying.
Asshole,
tell me you didn't do it!
I had to.
No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.
- No, you didn't!
- Quill!
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!
Hey, stop! Stop!
It's coming, it's
coming. I got it, I got it!
Oh, God.
Come and get some,
space dogs!
Come on! Get some! Get some!
Come on! Get some!
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.
Okay. How much for the arm?
Oh, I'll get that arm.
New haircut?
Noticed you've copied
my beard.
By the way, this is
a friend of mine, Tree.
I am Groot.
I am Steve Rogers.
Fall back! Fall back, now!
Focus that fire
on the left flank, Sam.
I'm doing it.
Why was she up there
all this time?
She's on the field. Take it.
Guys, we got
a Vision situation here.
Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him!
- On my way.
He'll die alone. As will you.
She's not alone.
Oh, no, you don't.
This isn't gonna be
like New York, pal.
This suit's already kicked
the crap outta the Hulk.
What? No! No!
Guys!
Vision needs backup, now!
Hulk? Hulk,
I know you like making your
entrance at the last second.
Well, this is it, man.
This is the last, last second.
Hulk! Hulk!
Hulk!
No!
Oh, screw
you, you big, green asshole!
I'll do it myself!
Come on! Yeah!
See ya!
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.
I thought you were formidable,
machine.
But you're dying,
like any man.
Get outta here!
Go!
That was really gross.
I thought I told you to go.
We don't trade lives, Captain.
I got you. I got you.
I'm sorry I can't remember
anybody's names.
You're full of tricks, wizard.
Yet you never once used
your greatest weapon.
A fake.
You throw another moon at me,
and I'm gonna lose it.
Stark.
You know me?
I do.
You're not the only one
cursed with knowledge.
My only curse is you.
Come on!
All that for a drop of blood.
You have my respect, Stark.
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.
I hope they remember you.
Stop.
Spare his life...
and I will give you the stone.
No tricks.
Don't.
One to go.
Where is he?
Did we just lose?
Why would you do that?
We're in the endgame now.
Are you okay?
What? What is it?
He's here.
Everyone, on my position.
We have incoming.
What the hell?
Cap.
That's him.
Eyes up. Stay sharp.
Wanda.
It's time.
No.
They can't stop him, Wanda,
but we can.
Look at me.
You have the power
to destroy the stone.
Don't.
You must do it. Wanda, please.
We are out of time.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
You can.
If he gets the stone,
half the universe dies.
It's not fair.
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.
It's all right.
You could never hurt me.
I just feel you.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I love you.
I understand, my child.
Better than anyone.
You could never.
Today, I lost more
than you can know.
But now is no time to mourn.
Now is no time at all.
No!
I told you...
you'd die for that.
You should have...
You should...
You should have
gone for the head.
No!
Daughter?
Did you do it?
Yes.
What did it cost?
Everything.
What did you do?
What'd you do?
Where'd he go?
Thor.
Where'd he go?
Steve?
Up, General. Up!
This is no place to die.
I am Groot.
Oh...
No, no, no!
Groot! No.
Sam!
Sam, where you at?
Something's happening.
Quill?
Steady, Quill.
Oh, man.
Tony.
There was no other way.
Mr. Stark?
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
I don't... I don't know
what's happening.
I don't know...
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go, sir.
Please.
Please, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.
I'm sorry.
He did it.
What is this?
What the hell is happening?
Oh, God.
Still no word
from Stark?
No, not yet.
We're watching every satellite
on both hemispheres,
but still nothing.
What is it?
Multiple bogeys
over Wakanda.
Same energy signature
as New York?
Ten times bigger.
Tell Klein
we'll meet him at...
Nick! Nick!
They okay?
There's no one here.
Call Control.
Code red.
Nick.
Hill.
Oh, no.
Mother...
BOY: Baba...
MAN: Yes, my son.
BOY: Tell me a story.
MAN: (CHUCKLES) Which one?
The story of home.
Millions of years ago...
a meteorite
made of vibranium...
the strongest substance
in the universe...
struck the continent
of Africa...
affecting the plant life
around it.
And when
the time of man came...
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...
until a warrior shaman...
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...
a plant that granted him
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.
The warrior became king...
and the first Black Panther...
the protector of Wakanda.
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...
more advanced
than any other nation.
But as Wakanda thrived...
the world around it descended
further into chaos.
To keep vibranium safe...
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...
keeping the truth
of their power
from the outside world.
And we still hide, Baba?
Yes.
BOY: Why?
(IN THE TRUNK
BY TOO $HORT PLAYING)
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!
Whatever!
Get outta here!
Check up.
Pick your man up! He open.
Where you at?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Pass! Pass!
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!
Watch me get this.
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.
KID: Come on.
BOY: What you got?
You ain't got nothing.
MAN: Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,
won't be no worries.
You in the van,
come in through from the west.
Come around the corner.
- Land right here.
- Mmm-hmm.
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...
(FAINT RUSTLING)
Hide the straps.
Yo, is it the Feds?
No.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.
They're holding spears.
Open it.
JAMES: You serious?
They won't knock again.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Prove to me you are one of us.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
My King.
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.
As you wish.
At ease.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Come, baby brother.
how you are holding up.
You look strong.
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.
How is home?
Not so good.
(IN XHOSA) Baby brother.
There has been an attack.
This man...
Ulysses Klaue...
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.
Many lives were lost.
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...
and how to strike.
He had someone on the inside.
Why are you here?
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.
I did no such thing.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Tell him who you are.
Zuri, son of Badu...
What?
James. James, you lied to me?
Leave him.
You were Wakandan
this whole time?
You betrayed Wakanda!
How could you lie
to me like...
Stand down.
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?
Prince N'Jobu...
you will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
Check up!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Guard your man,
guard your man!
Yo.
REPORTER:
The tiny nation of Wakanda
is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.
The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...
after a terrorist attack
at the United Nations
a week ago.
The suspect
has since been apprehended.
Though it remains one of
the poorest countries
in the world...
fortified by
mountain ranges...
and an impenetrable
rainforest...
Wakanda does not engage
in international trade
or accept aid.
The succession
of the throne...
is expected to fall
to the oldest
of the king's two children...
Prince T'Challa.
OKOYE: My Prince...
coming up on them now.
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.
Hmm.
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.
Just don't freeze
when you see her.
What are you talking about?
I never freeze.
(MEN GRUNTING)
MILITANT 1: What's going on?
MILITANT 2: It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.
The car no start.
MILITANT 3: What happened?
MILITANT 4: The engine failed.
MILITANT 1: Ours, too.
What is it, Captain?
- Defense positions.
- (GUNS COCKING)
Defense positions.
MILITANT 2:
Are we under attack?
Defense positions.
Get around to the side.
Defense positions.
Hey. Defense positions!
No games.
(BARKING)
What do you see?
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
- Come in. Come in.
- (SCREAMS)
Over there! Look back!
Watch out!
(ALL SCREAMING AND GRUNTING)
NAKIA: T'Challa, no!
This one's just a boy.
He got kidnapped as well.
BLACK PANTHER: Nakia...
I...
- I wanted...
- MILITANT 1: Hey!
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!
I will shoot her right now.
(GROANS)
You froze.
BLACK PANTHER: Ah...
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.
My father is dead, Nakia.
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.
And I wish for you
to be there.
NAKIA:
Carry yourselves home now.
WOMAN: Thank you.
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.
Thank you oh.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
You will speak
nothing of this day.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.

we are home.
This never gets old.
(WAKANDA BY BAABA MAAL

Queen Mother...
Princess...
My comfort for your loss.
RAMONDA: Thank you, Nakia.
It is so good
to have you back with us.
Take her to
the River Province
to prepare her
for the ceremony.
Yes, General.
Did he freeze?
Like an antelope
in headlights.
(LAUGHING)
Are you finished?
So surprised
my little sister came
to see me off
before our big day.
You wish!
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.
How many times
do I have to teach you?
Just because something works
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.
You are teaching me?
What do you know?
SHURI: More than you.
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...
to your ceremonial outfit.
Shuri!
Sorry, Mother!
How are you
feeling today, Mama?
Proud.
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.
He is with us...
and it is your time
to be king.
Good morning.
How can I help you?
I was just checking out
these artifacts.
They tell me
you're the expert.
Ah. You could say that.
They're beautiful.
Where's this one from?
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...
present day Ghana...
19th century.
For real?
What about this one?
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...
16th century.
Now, tell me about this one.
Also from Benin,
seventh century.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Fula tribe, I believe.
Nah.
I beg your pardon?
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin
but it's from Wakanda.
And it's made
out of vibranium.
(CHUCKLES) Don't trip.
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.
These items aren't for sale.
How do you think
your ancestors got these?
You think they paid
a fair price?
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?
Sir, I'm going to have to
(CLEARS THROAT)
ask you to leave.
You got
all this security in here
watching me
ever since I walked in.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- But you ain't checking for
- what you put in your body.
- (GASPS)
All right, mate.
Let's have it.
- Come on, mate. Time.
- (GRUNTS)
I think she might not
be feeling too good.
Somebody get some help!
Come here!
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!
GUARD: Medical emergency
right away
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.
Look out.
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.
I'm gonna take a break.
MEDIC 1: Let's give the lady
some space, please.
MEDIC 2: Step back,
please, gents.
Step back, please.
(GUARDS GRUNT)
Hey, come here.
Come here. It's okay.
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?
Because it's better to leave
the crime scene
more spread out.
Makes us look like amateurs.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Now then,
let's see if you know
what you're talking about.
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
That's just a taste.
(SNIFFING)
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.
(CHUCKLES) It's already sold!
Whatever you try,
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.
That'll make my day.
I can kill two birds
with one stone.
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

And now you want to

T'CHAKA: Stand up.

What is wrong my son?
I am not ready.
Have you not prepared
to be king your whole life?
Have you not trained
and studied,
been by my side?
what I am talking about.
I am not ready
to be without you.
A man who has not prepared
his children
for his own death...
has failed as a father.
Have I ever failed you?
Never.
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.
I want to be
a great king, Baba.
Just like you.
You're going to struggle.
So you'll need to
surround yourself
with people you trust.
You're a good man
with a good heart.
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.
(GASPING)
Breathe.
T'Challa, breathe.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Breathe.
He was there.
(CHUCKLES)
He was there. My father.
(BEREBERE BY IDRISSA SOUMAORO

Just one?
Come home, Nakia.
I'm right here.
Stay.
I came to support you
and to honor your father...
but I can't stay.
I found my calling out there.
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.
I can't be happy here...
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?
Share what we have.
We could provide aid...
and access to technology
and refuge
to those who need it.
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.
If the world found out
what we truly are...
what we possess...
we could lose our way of life.
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others
and protect ourselves
at the same time.
(SIGHS)
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.
- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.
T'CHALLA: Is that him?
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?
W'KABI: Of course.
I see Nakia is back.
You guys going to work it out?
T'Challa...
what's wrong?
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.
More, like what?
Foreign aid, refugee programs.
You let the refugees in...
they bring their problems
with them.
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...
to go out there
and clean up the world,
then I'll be all for it.
But waging war
on other countries
has never been our way.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILLING)
You, too, huh?
Bast! We're in trouble.
My King.
My love.
You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...
in South Korea...
tomorrow night.
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.
We need a king.
My parents were killed
when he attacked.
Not a day goes by
when I do not think
about what Klaue took from us.
From me.
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.
W'KABI: Take me with you.
We'll take him down together,
side by side.
I need you here
protecting the border.
Then I ask...
you kill him
where he stands...
or you bring him back to us.
You have my word.
I will bring him back.
We will proceed
with the mission.
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
My King!
- Stop it. Stop it.
- (CHUCKLES)
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?
Okoye.
And Nakia as well.
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?
Yes.
We'll be fine.
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.
Yes!
I have great things
to show you, Brother.
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.
Unlimited range,
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.
Check these out.
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.
T'CHALLA: Ah.
And what are these?
The real question is
(SHOUTS) what are those?
(CHUCKLES)
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.
I bet the Elders loved that.
(CHUCKLES)
Try them on.
Fully automated.
Like the old American movie
Baba used to watch.
T'CHALLA: Mmm.
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.
Interesting.
Guess what I call them.
Sneakers.
Because you...
Never mind.
If you're going to take
on Klaue...
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.
Exhibit A.
T'CHALLA: My design.
SHURI: Old tech.
- Old?
- Functional, but old.
"Hey, people are shooting
at me.
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."
- Enough.
- (CHUCKLES)
Now, look at these.
Do you like that one?
Tempting.
But the idea
is to not be noticed.
This one.
(TRILLING)
Now tell it to go on.
SHURI: Ooh!
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.
Strike it.
- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not that hard, genius!
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.
I invite you to my lab,
and you just
kick things around?
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.
Hey.
Wait a minute.
SHURI: The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...
and hold it in place
for redistribution.
Very nice.
Strike it again
in the same spot.
(KIMOYO BEADS BEEP)
You're recording?
For research purposes.

(IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia.
Good to see you.
Who are these two?

Very deep pockets.
They're good.

was she referring to?
Ah... I got into

with some ivory traders.
- Made a bit of a mess.
- Hmm.
And will there be
any trouble tonight,
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?
Depends...
on how quickly we finish

I count three.
OKOYE: Five.
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

Six.
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.
It just got
a little more complicated.
Agent Ross.
Your Highness.
You are buying from Klaue.
What I'm doing or not doing...
on behalf of
the U.S. government
is none of your concern.
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.
I gave you Zemo.
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...
that the king of
a third world country
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?
I'd say we were even.
You really need to leave, now.
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.
You've been warned.
CROUPIER: Three, craps.
Hey, you won!
You know what?
I think
I'll just take these...
bring them over here
- and hold on for safekeeping.
- ROSS: Mmm-hmm.
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.
He cannot leave with Klaue.
All right.
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia
links back to a person...
that I'm not actually saying
I'm here to make
a deal with...
but that deal
will not be called off.
When the dust settles,
you and me can work
something out.
I'm not here to make a deal.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING

(DOOR BUZZING AND BEEPING)
Klaue, plus eight!
General.
In position
to secure our exit.
And the vibranium?
I don't see it yet.
OKOYE: I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.
There's not supposed to be.
Somebody did not get the memo.
Definitely armed.
Well, that is quite
the entourage.
You got a mixtape coming out?
Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Yeah, actually, there is one.
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.
(CHUCKLES)
You think they're for you?
Don't worry.
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,
thank you very much.
OKOYE: Six more. It's a setup.
You got the diamonds?
Okay. That's enough.
- We need to move on Klaue.
- T'CHALLA: Stand down.
We can't afford a shootout.
Vibranium?
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.
It's now or never.

You savages didn't deserve it.
- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.
(IN XHOSA) King!
The world watches.
Let's go, huh?
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)
Yeah.
KLAUE: Hello.
(GIGGLES)
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.
(CACKLING)
(AIR KISSES)
(SPLUTTERING)
So this is a big mess, huh?
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes
than to make a scene here.
After your questioning,
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor
by letting you
even be in here.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
If he touches you again,
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.
Does she speak English?
When she wants to.
Huh.
I'm going in.
When I'm done,
you guys are up.
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.
You see that?
It's called diplomacy.
You're welcome.
(KLAUE SINGS WHAT IS LOVE
BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN
AND JUNIOR TORELLO)
- Okoye.
- (SCOFFS)
Play nice.
Americans.
(KLAUE CONTINUES SINGING)
(ROSS CLEARS THROAT)
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.
I'm much more your speed.
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.
Where'd you get that?
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.
But I can get you one,
if you like.
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,
and I'll ask them.
He's right outside.
Why don't you
ask him yourself?
What? T'Challa?
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?
Bingo.
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?
ROSS: Um...
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.
KLAUE: (ON EARPIECE)
It's all a front.
Explorers searched for it
for centuries.
El Dorado, the Golden City.
They thought they could
find it in South America...
but it was in Africa
the whole time.
A technological marvel.
All because it was built
on a mound
of the most valuable metal
known to man.
Isipho, they call it.
The gift.
Vibranium.
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.
It's not just a metal.
They sew it
into their clothes.
It powers their city,
their tech...
their weapons.
Weapons?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.
That's a nice fairy tale,
but Wakanda is
a third world country...
and you stole
all their vibranium.
(LAUGHING) I stole...
All of it?
I took a tiny piece of it.
They have
a mountain full of it.
They've been mining it
for thousands of years...
and they still haven't
scratched the surface.
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it
and got out of there alive.
If you don't believe me,
you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.
What his claws are made of.
(BEEPING)
Your father told the UN...
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.
But now he's telling me
you have more.
And you believe the word
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?
(TRUCK BEEPING)
(IN KOREAN) Where is that?
Back there.
How much more are you hiding?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Something is happening
out back.
(YELLS)
Get down!
- (KLAUE YELLING)
- Stand down!
MAN 1: Cover!
MAN 2: Grenade!
I see you took your time,
didn't you? (LAUGHS)
(OKOYE SPEAKING XHOSA)
My King!
My King.
Nakia.
He just jumped in front of me.
(LABORED BREATHING
AND GRUNTING)
I don't think
he'll make it here.
It hit his spine.
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)
This will stabilize him
for now.
(ROSS GRUNTING SOFTLY)
(EXHALING DEEPLY)
Give him to us.
We can save him.
OKOYE: Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.
We failed.
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?
He took a bullet for me.
OKOYE: That was his choice.
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?
Let us consider
that we heal him.
It is his duty to report back
to his country.
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.
I cannot just let him die...
knowing we can save him.
Where exactly
are we taking him?
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.
This is going to be fun.
He will live.
- (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
- (MUSIC STOPS)
W'Kabi is here.
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?
He's not here.
(SIGHS)
He slipped through our hands.
"Slipped"?
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.
With you,
I thought it'd be different.
But it's more of the same.
Let's get going, boss.
You always sell to the CIA?
I sell to the highest bidder.
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...
and I lay low for a bit,
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.
I know you good for it.
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.
You don't want to
go there, boy.
Yeah, I do.
KLAUE: Drop it!
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine
ends today.
Put your gun down now!
I'm sorry.
- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.
(KLAUE GROANS)
(GROANS)
(KLAUE PANTING)
You really want to go
to Wakanda?
They're savages.
This is what they do
to people like us.
KILLMONGER: I ain't worried
about no brand.
Check these out.
Each one is for a kill.
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.
(CHUCKLING)
T'CHALLA: Leave us!
So your mission did not go
as planned.
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?
My father told me
he disappeared.
There was a man today...
wearing a ring
identical to this one.
That is not possible.
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!
My grandfather's ring!
Do not tell me
what is possible.
Tell me the truth!
Some truths...
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.
That is not your choice
to make.
What happened to him?
I promised the king
to say nothing.
I am your king now!
Your uncle took...
a War Dog assignment
in America.
Your father...
placed me there...
to observe...
unbeknownst to him.
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.
They had a child.
The hardships he saw there...
radicalized your uncle.
I observed
for as long as I could.
Their leaders
have been assassinated.
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.
All over the planet...
our people suffer because
they don't have the tools
to fight back.
With vibranium weapons,
they could overthrow
every country...
and Wakanda could
rule them all
the right way.
He knew your father
would not support this.
So, your uncle betrayed us.
No!
He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.
No, no, no.
You will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
ZURI: He drew his weapon
on me.
- No!
- (GRUNTING)
ZURI: Your father
killed his own brother...
to save my life.
Speak nothing of this.
And the child?
We left him.
We had to...
maintain...
the lie.
What is this?
Just a little gift.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
(GRUNTING)
All right, where am I?
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!
(STAMMERS) What?
My name is Everett.
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...
former air force pilot
and now CIA.
Right.
Okay, is this Wakanda?
No, it's Kansas.
How long ago was Korea?
SHURI: Yesterday.
I don't think so.
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
They do here.
But not by magic,
by technology.
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.
ROSS: These train things...
that's magnetic levitation,
right?
Obviously.
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.
The light panels,
what are they?
- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?
In its raw form...
vibranium is too dangerous
to be transported
at that speed...
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.
ROSS: There's vibranium
on those trains?
There's vibranium
all around us.
That's how I healed you.
(CHUCKLES)
Where is T'Challa?
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.
A man showed up at the border
who claims
to have killed Klaue.
What?
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.
We need to find your brother!
An outsider?
No, a Wakandan.
He's not a Wakandan.
He's one of ours.
He killed his own brother...
and left a child behind...
with nothing.
What kind of king...
What kind of man does that?
No man is perfect.
Not even your father.
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...
he may have created something
even worse.
Hey.
Look at me.
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
Brother, you need to
get here now!
ROSS: Erik Stevens.
Graduated Annapolis age 19...
MIT for grad school.
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,
like it was a video game.
Started calling him
Killmonger.
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.
They will drop off the grid...
so they can
commit assassinations
and take down governments.
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?
SHURI: He has
a War Dog tattoo...
but we have no record of him.
Is this man Wakandan or not?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Tell us what is going on.
Speak.
I'm standing in your house...
serving justice to a man
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand
is because I know who you are.
Now, what do you want?
I want the throne.
(LAUGHS AND SPEAKS XHOSA)
My goodness.
(TRIBES' ELDERS LAUGHING)
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.
Must feel good.
It's about two billion people
all over the world
that looks like us.
But their lives
are a lot harder.
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.
And what tools are those?
Vibranium. Your weapons.
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...
for people
who are not our own.
Not your own?
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?
So ain't all people
your people?
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.
And it is my responsibility
to make sure
our people are safe...
and that vibranium
does not fall
into the hands
of a person like you.
KILLMONGER: Mmm...
RAMONDA: Son.
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.
Reject his request.
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.
An American black operative.
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.
That's not my name, Princess.
Ask me, King.
No.
Ask me.
Take him away.
(IN XHOSA) Who are you?
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.
Son of N'Jobu?
with Panther claws
in his chest!
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.
(IN XHOSA) You're lying!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.
RIVER TRIBE ELDER:
(GASPS) What?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
The descendent of N'Jobu.
I'm exercising my blood right
to challenge
for the mantles of king...
and Black Panther.
Do not do this, T'Challa.
BORDER TRIBE ELDER:
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,
he is within his rights.
He has no rights here!
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.
Weeks? I don't need weeks.
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?
I accept your challenge.
SHURI:
He'll never beat T'Challa.
He should've just come
to the first challenge
and gotten it over with.
(UPBEAT DRUMMING)
ZURI: The king
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther
stripped away.
(LABORED BREATHING)
Where is Agent Ross?
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.
This is your last chance.
Throw down your weapons,
and we can handle this
another way.
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.
I trained, I lied, I killed...
just to get here.
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...
Iraq.
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters
right here on this continent.
And all this death...
just so I could kill you.
Let the challenge begin.
- (FAST-TEMPO DRUMMING)
- (GRUNTING)
Yield!
(GROANS)
(T'CHALLA GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
Snap out of it, T'Challa!
(GRUNTING AND GROANING)
(YELLS)
(GASPS)
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
Come on, get up.
Come here.
This is for my father.
ZURI: Erik!
- Zuri, no.
- Stop!
- Zuri!
- Zuri, don't!
I am the cause of
your father's death.
Not him.
Take me.
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.
No!
No! No!
Zuri, no!
(GROANS)
No!
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!
No! No!
(YELLING)
Is this your king? Huh?
(T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
Is this your king?
The Black Panther,
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?
Come on, Brother!
Is there nothing
that can be done?
- (T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
- Him?
He's supposed to protect you?
- No.
- No!
No!
Nah. I'm your king.
- No! No!
- We have to go now!
Queen Mother, let's go!
(RAMONDA CRYING)
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?
- Yes.
- (SIGHS)
(IN XHOSA) Thank you.
to them immediately.
(IN XHOSA) I cannot.
Though my heart is with you.
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man
who showed up here
only hours ago.
He is of royal blood.
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.
Does that really matter?
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.
Overthrow?
Nakia!
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.
What are you loyal to?
I loved him.
I loved my country, too.
Then you serve your country.
No. I save my country.
What's wrong?
The king is dead.
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.
First Baba.
And now my brother.
(CRYING) Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.
(RAMONDA SIGHS)
- (WHISPERS) It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.
Where's Okoye?
Okoye is not coming.
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.
Wait here.
What has happened
to our Wakanda?
(CHANTING SOFTLY)
SHAMAN:
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.
(SOBBING QUIETLY)
N'JOBU: What did I tell you
about going into my things?
Hmm?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
What did you find?
Your home.
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.
Yes. The sunsets there
are the most beautiful
in the world.
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.
Why?
They will say you are lost.
But I'm right here.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
No tears for me?
Everybody dies.
It's just life around here.
Well, look at what
I have done.
I should've taken you back
long ago.
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.
That's why they can't find us.
(GASPING)
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?
This all of it?
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,
we will be ready.
Another king?
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...
(CHOKING)
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.
(YELPS)
(BOTH GASP)
Burn it all!
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
You know, where I'm from...
when black folks
started revolutions,
they never had
the firepower...
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.
Where was Wakanda?
Hmm?
Yeah, all that ends today.
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.
Already in place.
I know how colonizers think.
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.
And their children.
And anyone else
who takes their side.
It's time they know
the truth about us!
We're warriors!
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.
OKOYE: Wakanda has survived
for so long...
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.
But the world is changing,
General.
Elders, it is getting smaller.
The outside world
is catching up...
and soon it will be
the conquerors
or the conquered.
I'd rather be the former.
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.
ROSS: So where are we
going again?
NAKIA: We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb
to Jabariland.
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.
Nakia.
I don't like this.
The Herb belongs to us.
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.
I am a spy with no army.
I wouldn't stand a chance.
(SIGHS)
We'll go.
Oh, boy.
(SHUSHES)
(MEN CHANTING AND GRUNTING)
ROSS: Oh, shit.
Look down. Stay calm.
Shuri.
Look down.
My son...
was murdered in ritual combat.
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...
(GRUNTS)
- The new king...
- (MEN GRUNTING)
M'BAKU: You cannot talk!
One more word,
and I will feed you
to my children.
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.
(LAUGHING)
NAKIA: Great Gorilla M'Baku...
this is why we are here.
To offer this to you.
An outsider
sits on our throne.
Only you can help us stop him.
Come with me.
- (GASPS)
- Impossible!
(RAMONDA GASPING)
Is he breathing?
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.
One of our fishermen found him
at the edge
of the river border.
He brought him to me.
Why do you have him
in the snow?
It is the only thing
keeping him
from joining the ancestors.
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.
Nakia, the Herb.
I call upon the ancestors.
I call upon Bast.
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.
Heal him.
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!
Okay.
(IN XHOSA)
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Wake up, T'Challa.
Wake up.
(T'CHAKA SPEAKS XHOSA)
My son.
for you to come home...
and be reunited with me.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Why?
bring the boy home?
Why, Baba?
He...
He was the truth
I chose to omit.
You were wrong to abandon him.
I chose my people.
I chose Wakanda.
Our future depended...
You were wrong!
All of you were wrong!
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!
We let the fear
of our discovery
stop us from doing
what is right!
No more!
I cannot stay here with you.
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.
He is a monster
of our own making.
I must take the mantle back.
I must!
I must right these wrongs.
- (T'CHALLA GASPS)
- (RAMONDA EXCLAIMING)
(SHIVERING)
Do you have a blanket?
NAKIA: Killmonger
has the full support
of our military.
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.
ROSS: Of course he did.
That's what he was
trained to do.
His unit used to work
with the CIA
to destabilize
foreign countries.
They would always strike
at transitions of power...
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.
You get control of government,
the military...
- Our resources.
- ROSS: Right.
The Great Mound.
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.
He will send our weapons
all over the world.
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.
- What?
- What about you?
The challenge
will have to continue.
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.
It is my duty
to keep you safe.
If he gets control
of our technology,
nowhere will be safe.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
The Black Panther lives.
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...
I will be right there
beside him.
As will I.
ROSS: I'm in, too.
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.
(M'BAKU YAWNS LOUDLY)
Are you done?
(STAMMERS) Are you done?
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
I owed you a great debt.
A life for a life.
Consider it paid.
Please allow my mother
to stay here.
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.
You know, I could use
an army as well.
I bet you could. (LAUGHS)
But no.
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.
It is our cause.
- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...
and now you speak of "us"?
I cannot speak for past kings.
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.
We both know the power
of vibranium.
If Killmonger
gains control of it,
who do you think
he will come for next?
We will not help you.
(SIGHS)
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
W'KABI:
Everything is on schedule.
Have the spies been alerted?
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.
But the War Dogs in London,
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.
We'll strike there first.
The others'll come around.
Look at this.
A handheld sonic cannon,
powerful enough
to stop a tank...
untraceable by
metal detectors.
And we got thousands of them.
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.
(EXPLOSION)
He lives.
N'Jadaka!
Wassup?
I never yielded!
And as you can see,
I am not dead!
All that challenge shit
is over with!
I'm the king now!
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!
- Shuri, now.
- SHURI: (ON RADIO) Copy that.
SHURI: Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.
What will we do?
Border Tribe!
(ALL GRUNTING)
(SHOUTS IN XHOSA)
(ALL YELLING)
Your heart
is so full of hatred...
you are not fit to be a king!
Come on!
Ayo, the king!
(SHOUTS IN XHOSA)
(ALL GRUNTING)
(SHOUTS IN XHOSA)

(ALL YELLING)
Ah!
W'Kabi, stop this!
Stop this now!
No!
(BLOWING HORN)
(MEN CHANTING)
(ALL GRUNTING)
Nakia and I will get control
of the Royal Talon with this.
So what do I do?
You'll have to fly it.
- What?
- You were a great pilot.
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.
It's just like riding
a hoverbike.
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?
Hey, Nakia, take that.
- I'm not a Dora.

SHURI: The stabilizers

You won't have protection!
Neither will he.
Okay!

I don't need a suit
to kill you.
Your reign is over!
You sat up here,
safe and protected.
T'CHALLA: You want to
see us become
just like the people
you hate so much.
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.
You have become them!
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!
The world took

My pop said Wakanda was
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.
(KILLMONGER GROANS)
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.
You believe that?
Kid from Oakland,
running around
believing in fairy tales.
(GROANING)
(SIGHS)
It's beautiful.
(LABORED BREATHING)
Maybe we can still heal you.
Why?
So you can just lock me up?
Nah.
Just bury me in the ocean...
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.
'Cause they knew
death was better than bondage.

Thank you.
You saved me.
You saved my family.
Our nation.
There's nothing
to thank me for.
It is our duty to...
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.
I should've...
You can't blame me,
I almost died.
Stay.
I think I know a way
you can still fulfill
your calling.
Please stay.

KID 2: Who man is that?
KID 3: Bucket!
KID 2: Easy.
When you said
you would take me
to California
for the first time...
I thought
you meant Coachella...
or Disneyland.
Why here?
This is where our father
killed our uncle.
They're tearing it down.
Good.
They are not tearing it down.
I bought this building.
And that building.
And that one over there.
This will be the first
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.
And you will spearhead
the science
and information exchange.
(CHUCKLES) You're kidding.
Eh?
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
Oh...
Hey, yo.
Man, what the hell is that?
KID 2: That's like
a Bugatti spaceship!
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?
What?
KID 2: Check it out, bro.
We can take this back
to the house.
Pull up to school in this.
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.
KID 4: On eBay.
KID 2: Everybody get, like,
a million apiece.
SHURI: I wouldn't do that
if I were you guys.
KID 2: Where you come from?
SHURI: From Wakanda.
KID 4: What is a Wakanda?
KID 5: Hey, yo!
This yours?
Who...
Who are you?
(ALL THE STARS BY KENDRICK
LAMAR AND SZA PLAYING)
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)
My name is King T'Challa...
son of King T'Chaka.
I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.
And for the first time
in our history...
we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...
with the outside world.
Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.
We cannot.
We must not.
We will work to be an example
of how we...
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...
should treat each other.
Now, more than ever...
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.
We all know the truth.
More connects us
than separates us.
But in times of crisis...
the wise build bridges...
while the foolish
build barriers.
We must find a way...
to look after one another...
as if we were one,
single tribe.
With all due respect,
King T'Challa...
what can a nation of farmers
have to offer
the rest of the world?

Are you playing around
with that man again?
- No.
- You're teasing him again.
- Don't wake him. He must rest.

No, I'm not.
SHURI: Thabo,
you're doing that.
KID 2: He's doing it.
He's lying.
SHURI: No, he's resting.
Go, go!

Much more for you to learn.
